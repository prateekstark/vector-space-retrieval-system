<TEXT>
 A chain-smoker who had been ordered by a judge not to puff in front of her children won the right to light up again. The appeals division of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted a stay of the order Tuesday, permitting 41-year-old <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> to smoke in the presence of her husband and children pending a hearing scheduled for September. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> said Wednesday she already is trying to kick the habit. `` I was only doing it -LRB- smoking -RRB- to annoy my husband,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>, who is seeking a divorce, said as she left for her first session at a non-smoking clinic. `` I'm coughing like crazy. I do n't think it's good for the kids. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Jahanshan </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon, went to court last year, arguing that her smoking is harmful to their children, ages 6, 7 and 9. He said he tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to get her to curtail her habit. Last month, Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> to confine her smoking to a small room in the couple's six-bedroom home. Her attorney, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandes </PERSON>, appealed, contending such an order is unconstitutional. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schissell </PERSON>, had no comment on the stay.

 Being a second-string quarterback can be hard on business, as the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> has discovered. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, backup to starter <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, says the restaurant operating in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb under his name `` was a business venture that did n't work out.'' The owners of <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s All-Pro Restaurant recently decided to close the eatery because of mounting debts. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> allowed his name to be used for the establishment in exchange for a small percentage of its profit and an agreement to appear there several times a week.

<TEXT>
 A tough year for farmers is in the wind _ that is, if an old Comanche Indian legend holds true. According to the legend, the wind direction at precisely sunrise on the day after the first day of spring will tell what kind of weather and farming conditions the next year will hold for the region. If the wind, called <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> ` na <PERSON> Yuna </PERSON>' e in Comanche, comes from the east or northeast, good harvests should follow; if it blows from the north or northwest, conditions will be A west or southwest wind does n't bode well, and a south wind is just plain bad news. Records on the annual ceremony are said to show a 92 percent success rate since 1906, the first year settlers gathered to see what the winds had in store. `` Chief'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkles </PERSON>, who has been performing the ceremony for 15 years, began his dance Tuesday with supplications to <LOCATION> Wakantanka </LOCATION>, the Father Spirit, and <PERSON> Mikeana </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, as well as the winds. `` The <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is revered because she gives us food to eat,'' he said. `` Wakantanka is the Great Father above _ we seek his blessings.''

The gusts died down as sunrise neared.

Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' claims of predictive accuracy, however, farmers do n't necessarily need to worry.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Above a pawn shop in downtown <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON> rips into a group of lackadaisical <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> high school students. In her first major dramatic role, the pop star is playing an inspirational teacher in a movie musical based on Sing, the annual song-and-dance competition in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s schools. The legendary program at such schools as Erasmus Hall gave rise to such talents as Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>. But with the urban decay of the past decade, only a dozen schools now take part. The struggle to preserve that old <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> spirit has inspired the film, `` SING,'' with a plot centered on education board plans to close a beloved high school where generations of immigrants got their start. With songs from the writer of `` Footloose'' and `` Fame'' and a tempestuous love story between a street-smart Italian kid and a Jewish princess, the Tri-Star Pictures production now shooting in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> is scheduled for release in February 1989. `` I'm hooked on it. I'm one of those people who think about community and pulling together and family,'' said <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON>, the rhythm and blues artist who first hit the pop charts in the 1960s with the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bells </ORGANIZATION> and later in the'70s with the trio <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON>. She has appeared in two previous films, `` A Soldier's Story'' and the TV movie `` Unnatural Causes.'' In `` SING,'' she plays Mrs. <PERSON> Devere </PERSON>, an adviser who shakes her junior class students out of apathy. `` She's very uplifting to the kids,'' <PERSON> Labelle </PERSON> said between takes of her chart-targeted big number, `` Total Concentration,'' in which she demonstrates how to put over a song. Producer <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadan </PERSON> and screenwriter-lyricist <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award for `` Fame,'' said they created the part with <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON> in mind and waited until she found time to do it. `` There's a real honesty there, nothing phony about her. In her own way she's lived through what this teacher has gone through,'' said <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON>. <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON> has charmed the crew by introducing them to her own home cooking _ fried chicken and potato salad. But she's not sure about life as an actress. `` I'm not a Cher. I do n't know if I'd have enough patience to do another movie,'' she said, complaining about the number of retakes. `` It hurts enough some times that you want to cry. I like to perform live.'' However, director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, who co-produced Streisand's landmark `` Broadway Album'' and is making his first feature film, said <PERSON> LaBelle </PERSON> looked great in the first rushes Co-stars include <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracco </PERSON> who played <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>'s wife in `` Someone to Watch Over Me,'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasser </PERSON> of `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>'' fame and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicenzo </PERSON> who was <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s boss in `` About Last Night.'' The young lovers are <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>. For co-producer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Meron </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and Sing alumnus, the project is a labor of love. `` In the high school I went to, Sing no longer exists,'' <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> lamented. `` <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> is one of the oldest communities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the way those communities found to express themselves was through music and dance.'' To research the film, the production team talked with veteran teachers in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and attended a Sing performance at <ORGANIZATION> Midwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where faculty member <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> launched the program in 1947. Sing competitions involved reviews or skits created and staged by a committee from each class. The musical skits were judged on sing night when freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors got to strut their stuff. In the 1950s and'60s, when Sing was at its peak, the competitions were fierce. Lyricist <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> also found inspiration in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where he's been working with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on the Broadway-bound musical, `` Carrie. `` After ` Fame' the last thing I wanted to do was another high school film set in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> about kids who sing and dance,'' he said. `` But <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has tradition and history we can only approximate in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The closest thing to that kind of longevity is in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> settlements like <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Sing became a metaphor for that tradition. `` I developed an enormous affection for Sing and the neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and a real despair for the passing of this tradition.''

<DATELINE>AKROTIRI, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New discoveries by American archaeologists indicate that humans could have settled on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> around 9000 B.C., 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. The finds also indicate that some species of ancient animals survived here at least 1,000 years after they were believed to have become extinct. If proven correct, the discoveries mean that <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> was one of the earliest human settlements north of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, along with the island of <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, also in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` If these dates are corroborated, the site will have provided by far the earliest archaeological evidence for island colonization anywhere in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' Dr. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, reported in a recent lecture. Scientists had previously dated man's arrival on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> around 7500 B.C. But archaelogists digging on a slope near the sprawling British air base at <LOCATION> Akrotiri </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' south coast recently found pygmy hippopotamus and dwarf elephant bones, some mixed with shells, flint and ash. Archaelogists believe the flint, an early cutting tool, was used to slice meat from the animals. The ash indicated cooking fires. Carbon dating placed the remains at around 9000 B.C., a millenium after those species of animals were believed to have died out. <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON> said that the animals, common to many <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> islands thousands of years ago, were wiped out by climatic changes during the last Ice Age that ended around 12,000 years ago. `` We thought ... these animals died out because of natural causes _ they could n't get enough food or enough water,'' <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON> said in an interview after the lecture. `` But now it looks as if man was also responsible for wiping them out.'' The <LOCATION> Akrotiri </LOCATION> excavation is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsors the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institute. The dig is under the direction of Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who currently is in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The original discovery was made in 1980 by a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> security officer at <LOCATION> Akrotiri </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pile </PERSON>, then a lieutenant, while he was training his men to seek out unusual objects. Underground excavation at the site, eight miles south of the port city of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, started last July and will continue this summer. <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON> said the actual age of the site will remain questionable until results of further tests are obtained. The finds are only some of the important discoveries unearthed by American archaeologists in the last few years on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the center of trade routes between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for centuries. The island is studded with relics of a history that spans more than 10,000 years, during which more than a dozen civilizations, including Achaean Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Armenians, Venetians and Ottoman Turks left their imprint. Americans are involved in six of the 20 digs currently being made in the Greek-controlled southern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The Cyprus American institute provides logistical help at one sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, at the Late Bronze Age town of <LOCATION> Kalavasos-Ayios </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhimitrios </LOCATION>, 18 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. It was one of the biggest Bronze Age settlements on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and a center for the island's ancient copper trade. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is the Phoenician word for copper. Last summer archaelogists uncovered the remains of a 13th century B.C. building, covering more than 10,764 square feet and once at least two stories high, that was apparently destroyed by fire. `` It's the biggest and most important building at the site and one of the biggest of that period in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> South </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, the dig's co-director. `` We also found some inscriptions which are very rare to the period in Cypro-Minoan script,'' she added. Cypro-Minoan, which resembles the script used in <LOCATION> Minoan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> 4,000 years ago, has never been deciphered. The presence of these inscriptions and the huge storage capacity of the building, known as Building X, suggest it was either a palace or a town hall. The storage room, more than 60 feet long and 24 feet wide, consists of an outer wall and six stone pillars that once supported the roof. The shards of at least 47 jars, some once as tall as six feet, have been found. All apparently had been smashed in the fire. But six intact jars were later discovered in pits below the floor. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> discovered a tomb, considered one of the richest and best preserved ever found on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, while digging an exploratory trench out from the building. The oval-shaped tomb contained the skeletons of three young women, a child about 3 years old and three infants. They apparently had social status and wealth. The women had been buried with gold and silver jewelry, bronze and bone artifacts, containers of wine with small cups inside and cylindrical ivory cosmetic boxes.

 An experimental treatment for enlarged prostate glands shows promise as an outpatient alternative to surgery that hospitalizes about 400,000 American men a year, researchers say. An enlarged prostate makes urination difficult by constricting the urinary tract, and the experimental procedure widens the narrowed portion by inflating a balloon, said <PERSON> Flavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. Test results show complete or significant resolution of the urination problem in about 80 percent of patients with the most common type of enlargement, he said. The half-hour procedure is done with only a local anesthetic and without an overnight stay in the hospital, he said. Standard surgery requires general anesthesia or a spinal injection that numbs the lower part of the body, and a hospital stay of several days. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that surrounds the urine-carrying urethra. In older men, it frequently enlarges and puts pressure on the urethra, making urination more difficult. The experimental technique is to be described Thursday by <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>'s colleague, <PERSON> Wilfrido </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda-Zuniga </PERSON>, at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiovascular </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Interventional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. More than 60 patients have been treated with the experimental procedure, called balloon urethroplasty, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview The patient takes a tranquilizer and the urethra is numbed with local anesthetic. A thin, flexible tube with the balloon on its tip is inserted into the urethra and guided to the narrowed portion, where the balloon is inflated. For the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> patients, the urination problem was erased or significantly eased in almost 80 percent of cases in which most enlargement was from the side lobes of the prostate, rather than the middle lobe, <PERSON> Castanada </PERSON> said. Most patients have predominant enlargement of side lobes, he said. When the main problem was the middle lobe, the success rate dropped to about 30 percent to 40 percent, he said. No recurrence of symptoms has been seen in any patient helped by the procedure, he said. Forty-eight have been followed for more than six months after the procedure, including one followed for three years, he said. `` We're at this point unable to know how long it -LRB- symptom relief -RRB- will last on the average,'' <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockett </PERSON>, professor and chairman of the urology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called the concept interesting. But he said more patients must be studied, and for periods longer than at least a year following the procedure, to better assess its effectiveness. Removing prostate tissue with standard surgery relieves symptoms for some 15 years, said <PERSON> Cockett </PERSON>, who is secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In another presentation at the meeting Thursday, participants are to discuss an experimental alternative to removing gallbladders. About 500,000 gallbladders are removed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually. Gallstones are the most frequent reason, said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of cardiovascular and interventional radiology at the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In two patients, Italian scientists have instead guided a flexible tube through the skin and into the gallbladder, used it to remove gallstones and injected a solution to turn the gallbladder into scar tissue. `` I still think it needs a lot of work, but it's exciting,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. He noted that machines called lithotripters, now used to pulverize kidney stones, are also being studied for destroying gallstones. It is too early to tell how lithotripters and the surgical technique tried in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will fit in to future management of gallbladder disease, he said.

 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sometimes needs `` the bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod'' to move on safety issues. In an unusual condemnation of an agency by the Cabinet officer who oversees it, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> of frequently harboring `` institutional resistance'' when the time comes to move harshly against the nation's aviation industry. At times, he said, `` it has been necessary to use the bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod to get the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to take needed safety actions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> blamed the problem on the agency's structure and not its employees. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is charged with writing and enforcing safety regulations for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation, running the nation's air traffic control system and promoting American air commerce. `` Because the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is charged with promoting and protecting the industry's commercial interests, it is sometimes reluctant to take safety and enforcement actions that impose significant costs and burdens on that industry,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee. As an example, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials and industry representatives opposed a 1986 proposal that airline and airport employees be screened by security devices, arguing that the plan was `` too burdensome.'' Even when the proposal was changed, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> delayed implementing the proposal for a year, he said. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was not being strict enough in punishing airlines whose employees did not effectively screen passengers for weapons. He sent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> a memo March 8 asking him `` to give his personal attention to this matter.'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> agreed, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` Often it takes someone from outside the organization to insist that there may be ways to enhance safety that are being overlooked,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` is filled with competent, dedicated professionals'' who are placed in `` an inherently untenable position'' by the agency's structure. Asked after the hearing if he believed <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> was responsible for any of the agency's problems, he said, `` <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>'s doing a fine job, doing an outstanding job.'' In a statement, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is taking steps to improve its efficiency. `` The current system for dealing with aviation issues is too slow and cumbersome,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized by some lawmakers in recent years for failing to move quickly enough to expand the number of air traffic controllers and for a lack of aggressiveness in making other safety improvements. Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the aviation panel, has introduced legislation that would make the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency in hopes of giving it the ability to respond more quickly to problems <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> could do a better job if its promotional duties and the air traffic control system were removed from its responsibilities. The agency should continue overseeing safety as a part of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he said, so, `` If you do n't get what you want out of an administrator, there's a secretary you can collar.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is losing influence in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by letting its military aid to the continent drop to an unprecedented low while the Soviets provide 17 times as much assistance, administration officials say. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove its emergency military stockpiles and facilities, and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has rejected the visit of a top-level military delegation, the officials say. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid levels to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year have dropped to an unprecedented low of $ 25.2 million, said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` We have since last year lost our prepositioning rights in one important African country, and have had important military'' negotiations canceled in another, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on foreign operations Wednesday. Although he declined to name either country, another official who spoke only on condition he not be named identified the first country as <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. He said the non-aligned government of <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> was unwilling to honor political arrangements made by his predecessor <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, who was deposed in April 1985. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, strategically placed in eastern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast, have been strained by <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s warming ties with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. As a result of congressional budget cuts, as well as the less cordial ties with the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> was canceled in fiscal 1988, along with six other African countries. The administration will seek a renewal of the aid for fiscal 1989, said the official. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, upset with a drop of its military aid to $ 5 million from some $ 20 million in 1986, rejected a visit by a high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military delegation, the official said. But the visit will probably be rescheduled, he added. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> warned that if the military aid for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> remains at the current level, `` we can no longer operate a meaningful aid program to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The administration has asked for $ 740 million in economic and development aid for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> next year and $ 83.7 million in military assistance. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> told the panel that `` the perception in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is that we're opting out. And that creates strains.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accounts for only 3 percent of the total military assistance to the continent, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said. In contrast, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has poured $ 15 billion into African states since 1980, more than 17 times the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> input, he said. In addition, the Soviets maintain 6,500 military advisers in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has some 45,000 troops there, most of them in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` Properly funded, the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid -RRB- program reduces reliance on Soviet bloc hardware and advisers,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said.

 Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> warned that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> violence could lead to war with neighboring <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, in which case <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might expel Palestinians from its occupied lands and from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. He made the comment Thursday, when Israeli security forces shot and killed another two Palestinians and seven were reported wounded in clashes throughout the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Israeli troops also rounded up hundreds of Arabs in an attempt to silence the leaders of the four-month uprising, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes divebombed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> for almost an hour, the second air raid in two days. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted Lebanese sources as saying 30 people were killed in the attack. Also Thursday, The Labor Party re-elected Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as its leader and candidate for the premiership. He said he would appeal to the nation to support the U.S.-initiated peace process _ in essence an exchange of land for peace with the Arabs. In the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, border policemen opened fire on demonstrators throwing rocks, concrete blocks and iron bars at them. Two protesters were killed, the army and the Israeli news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> reported. A Palestinian was shot in the leg and three border policemen were injured by rocks in the clash, <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> reported. Thursday's fatalities raised the Palestinian death toll to 109 by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> count since violence broke out in the occupied territories Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told journalists in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> that, by failing to halt the disturbances at their onset, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had lost its deterrent capability. As a result, he said, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states could launch a surprise attack against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The hawkish former general, a leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, hinted that in such a war, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might expel Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> referred to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurion </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurion </PERSON> refused to allow Arabs who fled the country during the 1948 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war to return to their homes. `` The rule that <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurion </PERSON> determined then applies now too,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said. `` Those who began the war in December 1987 must remember that they are fully responsible for its results ... Remember this well, not just the residents of -LRB- the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of -RRB- <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION> and Qalqilyeh but also those of <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> -LRB- in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- and -LRB- Israeli-annexed Arab east -RRB- <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who was re-elected by an overwhelming majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, accused the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> of frightening the nation into believing yielding occupied territories would threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. `` We will opt for a political solution,'' he said. `` The camp of intimidation rejects any political solution. The camp of hope believes in such a solution.'' Speaking at the same party gathering, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said: `` Peace is a more central element of security than -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories.'' In other developments Thursday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops converted <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools into detention centers as they continued a campaign of mass arrests in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Among those detained in the overnight roundups Thursday were several Palestinians allegedly responsible for drafting and publishing the latest underground leaflets, police ministry spokesman <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> said. He declined to say how many suspects were arrested. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, an Islamic official said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops detained about 200 Imams, or Moslem relgious leaders, in nighttime roundups this week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of those held were members of the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad movment. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials rounded up at least 15 Palestinians Wednesday night, bringing to more than 110 the number of Arabs arrested there in the last four days, the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyers' association said. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> decided to suspend the Palm Sunday procession because of the possibility of violence along its narrow, winding route through <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the Rev. <PERSON> Caudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. In another development, the government temporarily banned publication of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ittihad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilboa </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s adviser on Arab affairs, said the 40-year-old newpaper's `` statements had become far more extreme ... and completely changed in character,'' since the anti-occupation unrest began. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has four representatives in parliament. It has organized demonstrations and protests against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of the unrest and in favor of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state to replace the occupied territories' military government.

 Two passenger trains collided Thursday in a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> suburb, killing 27 Japanese students on a school trip, the Japanese Embassy said. Other reports said more than 100 other people were injured. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said one of the trains had ignored a stop signal when it left <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> station. There were discrepancies in death and injury reports. Foreign Ministry officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, citing reports from the Japanese Consulate in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, said the death toll of 27 included a victim that was possibly Chinese. A total of 47 Japanese and 57 Chinese passengers were injured in the crash, government officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Shigekazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said the injured included 36 people from <ORGANIZATION> Gakugei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kochi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION>. The crash, in the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Fengbang </LOCATION>, occurred at 2 p.m. when a northbound train leaving <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> collided with a southbound train arriving from <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenghao </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said it had not been determined if there were other foreigners on the train. The departing train's first two cars and the luggage car of the other train were knocked off the tracks. Most of the victims appeared to be in the first cars of the departing train, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the departing train `` rolled out of the <LOCATION> Kuangxiang </LOCATION> station, ignoring the prohibiting signal, and collided with the train that was entering the station.'' <PERSON> Kazuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON> at the Japanese Consulate in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> said one of the dead Japanese was <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimomura </PERSON>, identified by television stations in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as a 16-year-old student. The 193-member <ORGANIZATION> Gakugei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> group was traveling on the Hangzhou-bound train. <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON> said the group was in the car immediately behind the engine. `` We were playing cards and suddenly there was a loud bang, and things went flying all over the floor,'' said an unidentified male student interviewed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was a huge bump, and then one of our teachers came into the car and told us to get out,'' said another student. `` We broke the windows and climbed out.''

<HEAD>Bipartisan House Sends Senate $1.1 Trillion Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers are crediting the budget summit accord between congressional leaders and the White House for the bipartisan ease with which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent a $ 1.1 trillion budget for fiscal 1989 to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The spending plan, which alters some of the domestic priorities President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had included in his own proposed package last month, was approved 319-102 on Wednesday by the Democratic-controlled House. In contrast to last year, when budget writers toiled several weeks longer amid staunch opposition by Republicans, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers this time voted 92-78 for the resolution. `` I think it would have been impossible without the summit,'' Rep. <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said afterward. `` Democrats and Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are trying to work together,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the budget panel The spending plan would produce a deficit of $ 134 billion. It would thus avoid spending cuts that would be required under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law should the deficit miss the 1989 deficit target of $ 136 billion by more than $ 10 billion. To achieve that $ 134 billion figure, however, lawmakers agreed to use economic forecasts made by the administration. Had the legislators used the more pessimistic projections from their own <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, there would be $ 35 billion more in red ink, triggering spending slashes that are considered particularly untidy in an election year. Shortly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points last Oct. 19, administration officials and congressional leaders held four weeks of closed-door bargaining aimed at slashing the federal deficit. The pact they emerged with last Nov. 20 set broad outlines for federal budgets for fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, and for fiscal 1989. Their agreement settled in advance many of the disputes that typically spawn bitter, long-running debates among lawmakers, such as over how much money the government should spend for defense, domestic and foreign assistance programs, and whether new taxes are necessary. The 1989 budget resolution approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> precisely met those summit targets, according to budget committee numbers. Thus, the package provides $ 299.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in budget authority, the amount up to which the military can commit itself in new contracts, and $ 294 billion in outlays, or money to actually be spent next year. In addition, it provides $ 148.1 billion in budget authority and $ 169.2 billion in outlays for domestic programs that are not controlled by automatic formulas. And it allows $ 18.1 billion in budget authority and $ 16.1 billion in outlays for foreign aid. The $ 14 billion in new 1989 taxes called for by the summit have already been enacted into law. Lawmakers envision no additional taxes for the year. The budget would grant a hefty increase to space and science programs, although only about half as much as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted. It would also grant major increases in spending for education, the homeless, battling drugs and research and testing for AIDS. The legislators ignored <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposals to end federal assistance to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the Northeast passenger railroad, and to some development programs, and his effort to dramatically slash aid to mass transit programs. Most federal agencies would be given a bit less money than they would need to keep up with inflation. But many urban and rural aid programs such as the Farmers Home Administration's rural development grants and loans, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had slated for substantial cuts, would receive the same amounts of money as this year. And many programs geared toward helping low-income people, such as job training, would receive enough money to keep up with the rising cost of living. Military and civilian federal employees would be granted 3 percent pay raises. The budget resolution does not require presidential approval and sets spending targets. The actual money will have to be provided in later legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he did not expect full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the budget before the second week of

<HEAD>Backers Scaling Back Super Collider Funding Request</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Representatives of states vying for the superconducting super collider are seeking only about one-third of the funding initially planned for the project next year, in what they describe as a bow to political reality. Rep. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON>, R-Mich., said Wednesday that lawmakers from six of the seven states still in the running for the $ 4.4 billion physics research complex agreed to press for around one-third of the $ 363 million requested by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his 1989 budget Representatives from the seven states formed a task force last week to support the project, which has been attacked by congressional critics as likely to siphon away money needed for research in other areas. The dispute comes as both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House are trying to reduce the federal budget deficit. During a private meeting, the representatives discussed funding `` somewhere around the bottom of $ 100 million plus,'' <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON> said. `` We have not fixed on exact figures.'' They also discussed target dates in their drive to ensure that the project survives congressional budget cuts, <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON> said. `` As long as we've got good support from the leadership, we're sure we can get through the budget process,'' <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON> said The representatives will meet soon with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to discuss appropriations, <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON> said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is resisting calls to raise the level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic contact with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, saying it wants to maintain pressure on the Vietnamese to withdraw their troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., and Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., on Wednesday called for the establishment of a `` working <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence'' in They said little progress has been made on numerous issues which remain as the `` legacy'' of the Vietnam War, despite numerous visits to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by congressional and administration delegations. The administration, however, said it opposed the lawmakers' call for the creation of `` interest sections,'' which are typically established between nations that do n't recognize each other but acknowledge mutual concerns. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, for example, have interest section personnel stationed in third-party embassies in each others' nations `` We continue to believe that political and economic isolation is the most effective way of pressing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to end its occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released Wednedsay. `` We are prepared to discuss normalization with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, therefore, only in the context of an acceptable settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> which includes the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' it said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is in its ninth year. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and Ridge are both <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> is a former prisoner of war. They issued their call for greater diplomatic contact with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on the 15th anniversary of <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s release after five years of captivity <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said establishment of interest sections `` falls far short of diplomatic recognition, and certainly implies no approval of a nation's policies.'' He said that if no progress is made on issues such as Americans still listed as missing from the Southeast Asian conflict, then `` the option of further normalization'' could always be set aside. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said several members of the administration had indicated privately that they supported better communication between the nations, but that he expected that the administration's `` official'' position on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would remain the same <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> said greater contact also is needed to administer a two-year program to bring 8,000 to 12,000 children of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There is a tremendous logistical problem and barrier to progress, just by the fact that all of our technical people must travel in and out of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> every time there is to be communication,'' <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is chopping away at the huge timber harvests in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> rain forest, the nation's largest national forest and the timber cutting programs's biggest money loser The panel gave voice vote approval Wednesday to legislation pushed by hard-lobbying conservation groups to scrap the 1980 law guaranteeing that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gets at least $ 40 million a year to spend on Tongass timber sales. The money, much of it for logging roads to ancient stands of huge trees, was mandated as part of the compromise that apportioned public lands in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for various uses, including commercial development and wilderness. The compromise gave protected wilderness status to 5.4 million acres of the 17.9 million acre <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION>, which has the nation's largest populations of bald eagles and grizzly bears The 1980 law, in what backers said represented economic guarantees for southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, set a goal of commercially harvesting 450 billion board feet of Tongass trees every 10 years from non-wilderness sections. No other national forest has a congressionally mandated harvest goal or gets its appropriations without the year-by-year review <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gives to spending requests for other federal forests. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., said that because of low demand and falling prices for wood pulp from <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION>, taxpayers have lost 99 cents for each $ 1 in sales, with some old trees going for $ 2 apiece <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> called the 1980 law `` a mandate to overcut ... one of the world's only temperate rain forests.'' `` We're changing the entire environment when we cut 400 - and 500-year-old trees,'' he said Approved by the committee was a package put together by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., to scrap the 1980 timbering guarantees and assure that the Tongass is subject to the same timber-harvest planning practices applied to all other national forests The bill would put a five-year moratorium on commercial logging in about 1.7 million acres considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to be prime fish and wildlife habitat threatened by timbering. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s plan also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to renegotiate its long-term contracts to supply Tongass timber to two large mills owned by <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific-Ketchikan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. About two-thirds of the Tongass production goes to these mills, which convert it to pulp, principally for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Critics say the 50-year contracts, executed in the 1950s, give the companies a regional monopoly and too large a voice in <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> management decisions for the Tongass. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the Tongass now is `` almost a scandalous operation.'' `` We have a process that is not driven by rational forest management,'' he said. `` We have cuttings driven by a political bargain.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s only <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member and the ranking Republican on <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, opposed <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s plan because `` it basically shuts down the mills. ... We're talking about 6,000 jobs.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the committee was being unduly influenced by conservation groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which have made the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> and a proposal to drill for oil in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> their major Capitol Hill battlegrounds in 1988. Young called the environmental groups `` special interests'' and said, `` The national environmental community is jerking our string.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says old people do n't have to suffer poor health just because they're old. `` The whole theme of this meeting is it's never too late to start prevention,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said Wednesday at the close of a three-day workshop on health promotion and aging. How do older people maximize their health? The same way younger people do, said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>: do n't smoke, do n't drink too much, rest, eat right and exercise. `` Old age is not a disease and there are many oldsters who are disease free,'' said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. `` You do n't necessarily have to have your kidneys fail, you do n't necessarily have to have dementia. ... My plea would be to separate old age and disease. They do n't necessarily go together. Smoking is a prime example of the never-too-late approach, said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. `` There is a tremendous tendency on the part of physicians to say, ` Well he's over 65, he has n't got many vices, has n't got many years left, why bother the poor old fellow?''' he said. `` But if they would just look him straight in the eye and say, ` You're not going to live as long or have as good a quality of life as if you stop smoking,' if he stops he will note an immediate benefit.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, 71, said he is convinced older people will shift to healthier diets and exercise more if properly counseled by their doctors. `` I do think you can change a person's behavior,'' he said. `` If somebody is willing to look at him from a bird's - eye view and try to rearrange his life and point out how he could do these things and what the benefits would be, people listen and they Even though the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is aging, he said, it is not becoming less healthy. `` As we see people who are now in middle-age come along into the graying years they are going to be far healthier than this generation was when it entered the 65-and-older group,'' he said. `` These are the people who are jogging and swimming and hiking. These are the people who are snacking on salad and yogurt. These are the people who are wearing sensible shoes. They have stopped smoking. They have given up hard liquor. They wear seat belts. They understand the things they can do to preserve the quality of life and the function they already have.''

<HEAD>North to Receive Full Military Retirement Benefits</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Arraignment Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is beginning his retirement with more notoriety than most officers, but he is still entitled to the same benefits as any of the other more than 1.5 million men and women drawing military pensions. North, the former national security aide who was indicted last week in the Iran-Contra affair, announced two days later he had decided to retire on May 1 from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he was taking the step because he would probably have to subpoena high-ranking government officials to mount his legal defense and did n't want to do so as a military officer. By specifying a May 1 retirement _ a request that has been approved _ North will have completed the minimum 20 years of active duty required to retire with a pension. Unless an officer has served 20 years, he is not eligible to receive any type of pension. Starting at 20 years of service, the size of the pension for officers of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s age is computed on a rising scale _ going from 50 percent of basic pay up to 75 percent of basic pay after 30 years' service. In North's case, the lieutenant colonel is drawing $ 3,693.60 in basic pay a month, or $ 44,323.20 a year. With exactly 20 years of service, he will be entitled to 50 percent of that as a pension payment. North's former boss, Rear Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, retired in December with more than 29 years of service and is drawing a pension of more than $ 52,700 a year. North will have to pay federal income tax on his pension payments. But unless he goes back to work for the federal government, he's free to collect his military pension without limit for the rest of his life. Like his other former brothers in arms, <PERSON> North </PERSON> also will be eligible for a number of other benefits to help ease his entry into private life. For example, if he wants to continue shopping at a military commissary or exchange, he'll have that right. The former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> will also be able to relax at military officer clubs, use military recreation facilities and read books at military libraries. If he wants to shop for liquor at a military package store or take in a movie at a theater on base, he can do that, too. And he can also drop off his laundry at a base dry cleaning store or buy new clothing. As a retired officer, <PERSON> North </PERSON> also is provided the right to medical care at a military hospital, but only on a space-available basis. Active-duty servicemen are given first priority. If he ca n't gain admission to a military hospital, <PERSON> North </PERSON> will be covered by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CHAMPUS </ORGANIZATION> health insurance plan. When he uses a private hospital and CHAMPUS, however, he'll have to pay an annual deductible and 25 percent of his bill. As a retired officer drawing a pension, <PERSON> North </PERSON> also will be eligible for burial in a national cemetery.

<BYLINE>UAW Says Ruling Allows ``Economic Warfare Against Working People.''
^By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> dealt a `` blow to working families throughout <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' by upholding a law limiting food-stamp eligibility for striking workers. The high court said Wednesday a 1981 federal law imposing food stamp limits on strikers' families does not violate any constitutional rights. The 1981 law, amending the Food Stamp Act, generally bars a family from becoming eligible for food stamps at a time when one of its members is on strike. Families already receiving food stamps when a member goes on strike are not dropped from the program but are barred from receiving additional food stamps despite the loss of income. The law was challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, and some of the unions' members. They said the law violated strikers' freedom of association and speech, and denied equal protection to strikers' families. The court, by a 5-3 vote, disagreed. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said Wednesday's ruling `` serves only the interest of those who wage economic warfare against working people.'' He added, `` In a democracy which affords its citizens the legal right to form trade unions and engage in peaceful strikes, it is hypocritcal and inconsistent to punish the family members of those who choose to exercise that right.'' Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said: `` Union strike funds should be responsible for providing support and benefits to strikers during labor-management disputes. It was no part of the purposes of the Food Stamp Act to establish a program that would serve as a weapon in labor disputes.'' But Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> contended in a dissenting opinion that the 1981 law amounted to such a `` weapon'' for management. `` No other purpose can adequately explain the especially harsh treatment reserved for strikers and their families by the 1981 enactment,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The Food Stamp Act generally excludes benefits for people, and the households of people, unwilling to work. But <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> noted that people who can prove they quit their jobs for `` good cause'' may collect food stamps if otherwise eligible _ while strikers may not. White was joined in upholding the law by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s dissenting opinion. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the decision. The nation's food stamp program, paid for by the federal government and administered by the states, has supplemented the food-buying power of millions of low-income families since 1964. Participating households receive food stamp coupons that can be used for food purchases at retail stores. Eligibility for food stamps is based on income and several other factors.

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Harvest Up, But Quality Poor, U.S. Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists say the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s agriculture is still in trouble, despite a couple of back-to-back bumper grain harvests. At the request of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Soviets opened talks here last weekend on a new long-term grain agreement to replace the current pact which expires on Sept. 30. The agreement commits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy at least a specified minimum amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain each year. The preliminary one-day session was adjourned without anything conclusive announced or any indication as to when and where the negotiations would be resumed. But <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> note that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` does n't always meet the provisions of the agreement'' by failing to buy the specified minimum amounts. Last year's total Soviet grain harvest was 211.3 million metric tons, up slightly from 210.1 million tons in 1986, the first time that two consecutive grain crops of more than 200 million tons have been produced by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> noted that last year's Soviet harvest was of `` poor quality and contained above-average amounts of moisture.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> agriculture still has many basic inefficiencies and that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has had only slight success so far in his efforts to reform his country's agriculture. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seems now to be taking a less radical approach to agricultural reform than was anticipated a year ago,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. There has not been a dramatic shift toward a `` market economy'' and the promised increases in local autonomy for farm managers has been slow to materialize. Rather, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> added, `` The focus now seems to be on making adjustments to the traditional system.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, whose comments appear with <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s in a forthcoming issue of <LOCATION> Farmline </LOCATION> magazine, said the Soviet system historically has been hampered by a lack of incentives and authority for farm workers and managers. Policies have been decreed from above, with little reward for greater efficiency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms `` have succeeded somewhat in reducing paperwork associated with agriculture, but incentives and autonomy remain inadequate by our standards,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, money is still taken from profitable farms and given to unprofitable farms, in part to even out differences in farm wages, he said. Large disparities in income are avoided, but there is little incentive to make a farm more profitable.

 Agriculture Department on-site reviews of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have turned up sex discrimination and severe shortcomings in the hiring of blacks and Hispanics in agency offices. `` The prevailing view expressed by female employees during interviews is that sex discimination often enters into employment decisions,'' the report said Wednesday. `` This perception is corroborated by the number of sex discrimination complaints lodged and by the lack of women in higher graded positions.'' The review was made last year under the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Equal Employment Opportunity -LRB- EEO -RRB- program, which calls for compliance checks of several department agencies in various states, including <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> office released a number of reports on civil rights compliance by the agencies in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. In each case, the on-site review found the operations `` generally in compliance'' with civil rights requirments and regulations.

He asked the court to overturn the decision and rule in favor of <PERSON> Jonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union member dismissed from her job at the <ORGANIZATION> Norge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Herrin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The right of -LRB- state -RRB- action is available to both union and non-union employees alike,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> told the court in oral arguments Wednesday. `` That right is independent of the rights enjoyed under a collective bargaining agreement.'' <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is one of 21 states with laws against retaliatory firings. But a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Norge </ORGANIZATION> said the federal Labor-Management Relations Act makes enforcement of union contracts _ through the decisions of an arbitrator _ the province of the federal government. `` If independent state laws were enacted that flew in the teeth of a labor contract, they were pre-empted,'' attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the court. `` Permitting the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law to stand would be an incentive to undermine collective bargaining.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> conceded that states may act on health and safety matters but said Mrs. <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON>'s firing was a contract issue covered by federal labor law. According to court records, the woman notified the Herrin-based Norge in late 1984 that she was injured on the job and asked the company to pay her medical bills, as provided for by the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> workers' compensation law. <PERSON> Norge </PERSON> fired Mrs. <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON> a week later, contending she filed a false claim. However, the Machinists' contract with <ORGANIZATION> Norge </ORGANIZATION> contained a provision protecting workers from dismissal without just cause, and the union filed a grievance the day she was fired. An arbitrator later ordered her reinstatement with back pay. But in the interim, Mrs. <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON> filed a circuit court lawsuit contending the dismissal violated <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law and seeking additional compensation. The relief available through the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> court was greater than what she could receive through arbitration, which did not include punitive damages and compensation for lost overtime. Norge shifted the case to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where a judge threw out Mrs. <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON>'s lawsuit, ruling that state law was pre-empted by the arbitration remedy provided by federal labor law. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> upheld the dismissal in June 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to rule on the appeal in July. The State and <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said 21 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have laws protecting workers who file compensation claims. It identified the states as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Disabled Drivers Claim Out-Of-State Discrimination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Disabled motorists suffer from a patchwork of state regulations that leaves them vulnerable to parking tickets when they drive to other states, say advocates of a national parking symbol for the disabled. `` It is ludicrous for us to remove one barrier to the handicapped by offering handicapped parking spots, only to erect another by refusing an out-of-state resident the right to park there,'' Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday `` If a person is disabled in one state, does not logic dictate that the same person is disabled in another state?'' he asked. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> has drafted legislation that would require states to use a national handicapped access symbol and have reciprocity with all other states. States that do not comply would have federal highway safety funds withheld. A measure to withhold 2 percent of a non-complying state's highway safety funds was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year The House has not acted. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said he raised the issue after being contacted by <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGiovanni </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who started a campaign against the system three years ago after she was ticketed in <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, while parked in a handicapped zone. `` When states are allowed to ticket people for merely exercising their right to a handicapped parking space, it discourages handicapped people from going out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> DeGiovanni </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on surface transportation. She called the current system `` ridiculous'' and discriminatory. There are 6.5 million disabled Americans who use special parking permits. Only 15 states honor handicapped parking permits from every state, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> study conducted last year.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a respected new ally in his presidential campaign: Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, who hopes his <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsement will end speculation about a last-minute <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> bid. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up fellow Democrat <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s endorsement here Wednesday. The two held a news conference near the Statue of Liberty staged to highlight the presidential hopeful's immigrant roots. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he believes the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is the best Democrat to beat <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I believe <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can win. I believe he will be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> told a crowd of reporters and supporters at Liberty State Park. The senator promised to campaign for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ which holds its primary on June 7 _ and around the nation. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can defeat the vice president `` because he is tenacious, innovative, resilient and disciplined.'' `` This is a very important endorsement because it comes from one of the most respected and one of the most accomplished public figures in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> would be `` very, very important to our success.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he hoped the endorsement would end talk about his entering the race. The senator, a former Rhodes scholar and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> basketball star, has said repeatedly he does not feel ready for the White House. `` The plan I have for 1988 is helping <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. He also said he did not expect to be considered as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said such a ticket would be too heavily weighted toward the Northeast. `` I think <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> have a lot in common, but I do n't think they go together on a national ticket,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> jokingly pushed aside a common criticism aimed by some at him and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: that they are boring. `` It has been said of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that he is dull, a charge with which I am not unfamiliar,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, known as a somewhat wooden speaker. `` But governance is not an amusement park.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> also praised the other Democrats seeking the nomination, singling out <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as `` running a campaign that challenges the best in all of us.''

 Nagging disputes in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are casting a long shadow over the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit only two months before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sets out on his first trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The outlook for a pact to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons is not all that bright either. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> has not been swept away as an obstacle, and differences remain over how the bombers, submarines and missiles would be scrapped. `` I would n't want to lay you odds,'' was Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s hesitant response Wednesday night to whether the treaty would be ready for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to sign during the May 29-June 2 summit. Mobile missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles are hard to spot. That makes verifying compliance with the 30 percent to 50 percent arms reductions more difficult than last year's treaty to ban medium-range nuclear weapons. Experts on the two sides are still trying to mesh conflicting drafts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were directed by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to keep working at the verification problem and to report to them at their next meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> April 21. A treaty signing is not a prerequisite for a successful summit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have plenty of issues to discuss at their fourth meeting. But the report <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> gave at a news conference of his talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was generally bleak. It suggested the two leaders might not have much to celebrate. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> seemed taken with a promise by the foreign minister to consider changes in the way the Soviets deal with religious observances and with visa applications. Emigration of ethnic Germans and Armenians is up, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> noted. But he said Jewish emigration had reached a plateau. Besides, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of the promised reforms, `` what we are interested in is delivery.'' When he turned to regional disputes, the clouds turned darker. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is committed to end the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after more than eight years of bloody strife with U.S.-backed rebels. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not concur in an agreement to end the war unless the Soviets also suspended military aid to the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The main purpose of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand is to make it easier for an estimated 5 million refugees to return home. Had <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> accepted, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have stopped supplying Stinger missiles and other weapons to the resistance. The moratorium would be in effect during the Soviet troop withdrawal and for three months afterward. `` They did n't feel they could agree to that,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. And yet, he said, `` those conditions are needed for us to be able to sign as a guarantor'' of an international agreement to end the conflict. At the Soviet embassy, meanwhile, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was taking a stiff stand. The aid is required by a Soviet treaty with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. `` Those are legitimate supplies, and we are not going to rescind that treaty,'' he said. The picture in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was n't brighter <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the Soviets wanted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to an unspecified number of Central American governments halted as a condition for them to stop supplying <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for its war with Contra rebels. `` It did not seem something we could pursue,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, he said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> envisioned an active role for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that would get in the way of talks between the two sides. `` The Soviet concept is sharply different from ours,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. And in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> offered only hope that <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General, would be able to persuade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to end their 7 -LCB- - year war Referring to pictures of Iranian victims of alleged <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> chemical weapons, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said: `` The horrors of this war are just being borne in on us practically every day. It's hard to think it might get worse, but it does get worse.'' For eight months, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought to persuade the Soviets to support an international arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which refuses to accept a cease-fire. But <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> evidently did not give in.

 The gunman leveled his pistol at the convenience store clerk and pulled the trigger, twice. Click, click.

<TEXT>
 According to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Blades </PERSON>, a poor fish and fries vendor, a crisis is gripping his country because `` the people who have the money, inside and outside the government, are fighting for it.'' He says he does n't much care how this fight is resolved, as long as the combatants let him and his neighbors `` live in peace with enough to eat.'' As he spoke, <PERSON> Blades </PERSON> held his 17-month-old daughter in his lap outside the dilapidated wood and tin structure his family shares with several others in the Chorillo section of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Neighborhoods like Chorillo have been relatively immune from the violence borne of the campaign to oust military ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The opposition is led by a coalition of about 200 business, professional, labor, student and other groups. And most of the disturbances have occurred in middle - and upper-class neighborhoods <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who comes from a poor family, has tried to exploit class and race differences in resisting the pressure to resign. He and his government portray the opposition drive as an attack on the poor and black by the rich and white. Blades is quite aware of the argument. `` I think this whole thing is a class struggle,'' he said. `` There were those who always had the economic power. They are out and want to get back in, and they are trying to get the people to turn against the government.'' Blades was born in <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION> and has lived most of his life in this collection of ramshackle buildings adjacent the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> commands. The neighborhood was condemned as unsafe and taken over by the government more than 20 years ago. Thousands of people live there, rent free. `` We just have to maintain them,'' <PERSON> Blades </PERSON>, 34, said of the dilapidated structures. Blades, who makes a few dollars selling fish and fries outside his home, once served in the Defense Forces. He still feels certain solidarity with the institution, which he says has provided stability. `` The people from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> sometimes bring us lumber and other things we need to repair the buildings,' he said. Like others in his neighborhood, <PERSON> Blades </PERSON> described himself as apolitical, but discusses politics with ease. `` We all believe in democracy here. We are poor, but we are born democrats because we do not have much,'' he said. `` Those who are born with much, I do not think they can feel the way we do about all being equal.'' Many of Chorillo's residents do manual labor or odd jobs or work as taxi drivers. Many are unemployed. `` A change would not affect us much. I personally can not say I have lost all faith in politicians, but I do not trust them much,'' <PERSON> Blades </PERSON> said. Around the corner, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> rushed up a flight of stairs carrying a large dish of rice and chicken from the soup kitchen at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fatima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>. He and his pregnant wife watched as their children ate. <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> said he is a construction worker who has been out of work since late November, shortly after the political crisis began to affect the economy. `` I have always worked,'' he said. `` I am a painter also. I'll do any kind of job. The family lives in a single room with a stove that does n't work and a tiny altar. <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> gets by by peddling canned food provided by his father-in-law. But business is bad. Banks have been closed for week, the government has not paid its employees and an opposition-called general strike has virtually shut down <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. `` I am an honest man, but when I see them hungry, there are times when I feel like going out and doing something desperate,'' <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> said as his children ate. `` But my wife tells me to be patient. There has to be a solution. If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has to go, then he should go.''

 House Democratic leaders said Wednesday they would act quickly to send food and clothing to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contras if the rebels and the leftist Sandinista government reached a cease-fire. The promise came just hours before the two sides announced they had signed an agreement for a 60-day cease-fire to start April 1, and that the Contras have agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization. Neither the White House nor the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had any immediate comment early Thursday after the cease-fire was announced. At midday Wednesday, a group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, including several moderates regarded as crucial `` swing'' votes on the aid issue, proposed a package of primarily humanitarian aid. The proposal was offered as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> began talking with Republicans about breaking the aid deadlock. `` It is my earnest hope that we can obtain a bipartisan agreement on humanitarian aid so that the bill can be scheduled quickly,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` That is the best way to encourage the peacemakers in Central America.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also had preliminary conversations on the aid issue with House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and with White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said such a bill could be approved next week if the cease-fire talks under way in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, bear fruit, and if aid would be consistent with whatever agreement is reached by the Contras and the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government Both <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration expressed encouragement at the progress being made by the two sides in their first face-to-face, high-level talks. `` We want to be cautious but we are encouraged,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` They do seem to be making progress,'' he said, adding that was `` somewhat surprising'' in view of last week's Sandinista incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to attack Contra camps. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said three officials from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> would leave for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Thursday to track the disposition of small arms, ammunition, jeeps and other materials that were brought to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. `` My concern is that the deployment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops and weapons to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> could in fact be another diversion of arms to the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation. The aid bill proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and a dozen colleagues would provide $ 48 million for food, clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels over the next year It would allow the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to deliver the aid, and to deliver some $ 2.5 million in previously stockpiled weapons. The legislation also would guarantee President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that he could seek a quick vote on a new request for military aid sometime in June, but would leave the exact nature of the follow-up aid package up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The latter point seemed to meet a standard set by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who said any provision for a future aid vote would have to preserve <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' right to control its own legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would oppose any bill that includes the delivery of weapons as destructive to peace efforts, an aide said. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, who in the past has opposed any military aid to the rebels, acknowledged that the package reflected `` a hardening'' of his attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` It reflects a realization that we really ca n't walk away and hope that -LRB- Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is going to act in good faith,'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said. `` The guy does n't act in a way that is rational, by my standards.'' Several hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> supporters, most of them Democrats, joined MacKay in sponsoring the aid bill, including Reps. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Moderate `` swing'' voters supporting it were Reps. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., who has led pro-Contra efforts for the Republicans, said he also favored the `` The problem is whether the speaker will let it come to the floor,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` He is the obstacle.''

<HEAD>Seapower Panel Deletes Trident Sub In Favor Of Two More Aegis
Destroyers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stage for congressional warfare has been set by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee's vote to kill funding for the Trident submarine in the 1989 budget and use the $ 1.4 billion savings to build two more Aegis destroyers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seapower subcommittee voted in closed session Tuesday for the funding switch, conceived by the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. Word of the vote came Wednesday from Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., who vowed to fight it and predicted Trident funding would <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>'s district includes the Electric Boat shipyard, the division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that builds Tridents. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> promised to defend the change when the full committee looks at the fiscal 1989 budget next week. The subcommittee vote reflects congressional opposition to an administration plan to sell two Aegis DDG-51 destroyers to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and others fear the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would lose technological secrets as a result. Under the subcommittee plan, the government would order five Aegis warships in 1989 instead of the three requested by the administration. The two extra destroyers would be deployed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control, protecting Japanese security interests while keeping the Aegis technology under wraps. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is `` very leery'' about selling the warships to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of revelations last year that <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sold submarine technology secrets to the Soviets. But <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said the Pentagon has confidence in the Japanese government. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has held many of our secrets, so we do n't seem them as a security risk at all,'' he said. `` Toshiba is a company, not the government.'' The request from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for two Aegis ships has not been formally made, but is expected, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials had no immediate response to the <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> plan, but any suggestion to eliminate a Trident would likely be attacked by the Pentagon. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> quit as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last month in part because <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> refused to allow him to cut the Trident from the budget. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, who is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the seapower panel deleted funding for the Trident two years ago, but funding was later restored by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` While I am clearly disappointed by the decision of the seapower subcommittee, the subcommittee's decision is only the first step in a lengthy and complex budget process,'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he would fight to keep the Trident out and the two extra Aegis ships in. He said the program, which traditionally calls for one new Trident each year, would be continued in the 1990 budget. Electric Boat is the sole builder of the 18,750-ton submarine, which is armed with 24 long-range, multiwarhead missiles. The subs are built at the company's yards in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, R.I. The 8,300-ton Aegis destroyer, equipped with 90 missiles, is being built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Ingalls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, Miss.

<HEAD>Study Finds High Complication Rate In Common Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A common operation intended to prevent stroke causes death or serious stroke in 10 percent of the elderly patients who undergo it, a study published today concludes. The study, based on a large survey of the operation called carotid endartectomy, also found that two-thirds of the operations were judged to be unnecessary or of questionable value. The researchers concluded that the operation is substantially overused. In areas where the complication rate is as high as the average found in the survey, the surgery should never be done `` because the risks would almost certainly outweigh the benefits,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> doctors in their study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They recommended that the procedure be limited to hospitals and doctors that have low complication rates. `` If you look for very hard-nosed proof of the operation, it's hard to show that what we are doing is the right thing,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Skillman </PERSON>, a vascular surgeon at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> `` There are a lot of indications, as this paper suggests, that a lot of people are being operated on who do n't need the surgery at all.'' The number of the operations grew from 85,000 in 1982 to 107,000 in 1985. However, in 1986 it dropped to 83,000, apparently as a result of growing criticism of the surgery. `` It's my hope that with the publicity, it may be that people are asking for second opinions,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyken </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who was one of the first to question the wide use of the operation. The surgery is performed on the carotid arteries in an effort to prevent strokes. These arteries run up both sides of the neck. If they become plugged, the flow of blood to the head is interrupted, and some of the brain may die, resulting in permanent damage. In the surgery, doctors open the arteries and clean out plaque that partially obstructs them. `` You ought to have the operation if it is truly indicated for you and if you have a surgeon with a record for complications that is very good,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, one of the Rand researchers. `` Our guess is that if those two prescriptions were followed, there would indeed be a lot less operations done.'' The study reviewed the records of 1,302 randomly selected <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients who had the surgery in three different parts of the country. A panel of experts judged that one-third of the operations were justified, another third were questionable, while the rest were clearly unnecessary. In most cases, the Rand researchers considered the operation appropriate only if patients suffered warning symptoms, had significant clogging of the carotid arteries and were in good enough health to withstand the surgery. In the survey, more than 3 percent of the patients died as a result of their surgery, while more than 6 percent suffered strokes during or immediately after the operations. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said that when the operation is studied at big medical centers, the combined death and stroke rate is usually under 3 percent. Other studies have shown that if people have small strokes that cause momentary dizziness, brief blindness or other passing symptoms, they face a 10 percent annual risk of major strokes. If they have narrowed carotid arteries but no warning signs, their annual stroke risk is about 3 percent. Despite the findings, however, experts said that some patients probably benefit from the operation. `` I do n't think it suggests at all that the operation should n't be done,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J.M </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Robarts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. `` It suggests, though, that a more critical view of who should have the operation is required of our profession.''

<TEXT>
 The top lobbying group for commercial banks is condemning a proposal by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that would narrowly expand bank securities powers. Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, and the top Republican on his committee, Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on Wednesday proposed legislation that would repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial from investment banking in 1933. But the proposal by <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> would restrict bank expansion into insurance and real estate and includes an array of pro-consumer provisions. Hours after the bill was released, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the `` regressive ... and anti-competitive'' proposal would be `` unequivocably opposed by the banking industry.'' And a member of the banking committee, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, said he would offer substitute legislation mirroring a broader bill approved March 2 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. However, the proposal picked up praise from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> says it can back provisions. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a strong proponent of the Glass-Steagall Act, passed in reaction to the 1929 stock market crash, predicted the <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain-Wylie </ORGANIZATION> legislation `` will win a bipartisan majority.'' `` The chairman's bill hits the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consensus: <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should grant banks some new powers, but it should do so carefully,'' he said. The bill would allow nationally-chartered banks to underwrite and deal in commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds. About 4,600 of the nation's 13,650 commercial banks are federally chartered. Bank holding companies could underwrite and deal in securities through two types of affiliates: a limited subsidiary for commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds and a full-power subsidiary that would add securities backed by assets such as home, auto and consumer loans to the list. `` Frankly, in terms of increased competition and increased benefits to consumers from that competition, I would say no bill is better than what he is recommending,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, which is supported by <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> and by the banking group, goes further. It grants bank holding companies power to sell corporate bonds and mutual funds and provides for a separate congressional vote by 1991 on whether banks can underwrite corporate stock. Like the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, sponsored by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> bill bars bank holding companies from selling insurance outside the state in which they are headquartered and permits it only where authorized by state law The bill would prevent federal regulators from expanding the real estate powers of national banks and bank holding companies. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to rate banks on their compliance with laws protecting consumers and barring lending discrimination against poor neighborhoods. Only banks with good or excellent ratings would be permitted new powers, although banks with an average rating could get more powers if they make a specific commitment to make improvements. It also requires banks to provide `` lifeline'' checking accounts with minimum fees for customers with less than $ 1,000 to deposit. And it would require banks to cash federal, state and local government checks for non-customers.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from March 21 to 23, 1988, for the second of a series of meetings to review developments in U.S.-Soviet relations and to prepare for the meetings between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which will take place in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from May 29 to June 2, 1988. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received the foreign minister for a discussion of the state of relations and of objectives in the coming months in arms control, human rights and humanitarian questions, regional affairs and bilateral matters. The two sides gave priority attention to implementation of the agreements and understandings recorded in the joint statement issued by the president and the general secretary in their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting, as developed further during Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in February 1988 Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been realized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done. By mutual desire, the meeting between the secretary and the foreign minister began with a frank and businesslike exchange on human rights and humanitarian questions. The discussion of these issues will continue at the expert level. The secretary and the foreign minister and their senior experts held extensive discussions on arms control. They reaffirmed the strong commitment made in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Summit Joint Statement to make an intensive effort to complete a Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and all integral documents at the earliest possible date, preferably in time for signature of the treaty during the next meeting of the two leaders. The ministers reviewed the joint draft texts of a protocol on inspection; a protocol on conversion or elimination of strategic offensive arms; and a memorandum of understanding, developed in accordance with their directive at the February ministerial in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Reemphasizing their commitment to effective verification measures, they agreed that the negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> will seek to resolve the remaining differences in these documents and report on progress at the next ministerial. The ministers continued their review of the key remaining substantive issues associated with the treaty, as well as a wide range of treaty topics of interest to each side, including problems associated with: verification and counting of nuclear-armed long-range air-launched cruise missiles; limitation and verification of nuclear-armed long-range sea-launched cruise missiles; and mobile ICBMs. They also reviewed issues related to sublimits on warheads within the 6000 level. The secretary and the foreign minister also reviewed the progress at the nuclear and space talks on the negotiations regarding the ABM Treaty as discussed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit. They directed their negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to expedite preparation of a joint draft text of a separate agreement building on the language of the December 10, 1987, joint statement issued by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, allowing consideration of any unresolved issues at the next meeting of the secretary and the foreign minister in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Taking note of further progress in U.S.-Soviet full-scale step-by-step negotiations on issues of nuclear testing and confirming the commitment by the sides to the implementation of the agreed mandate of these negotiations, the ministers instructed their delegations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in particular to design and conduct as soon as possible the JVE in full conformity with the December 9, 1987 ministerial statement; complete a detailed plan and schedule for the JVE by the April ministerial; prepare a joint draft of the TTBT protocol by the time of the JVE, to be finalized through the conduct and analysis of the JVE; accelerate work on verification issues for the PNET. The two sides reviewed the situation on conventional arms control, with special reference to the mandate negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and expressed the hope for their completion in the context of a successful outcome of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> CSCE meeting. The ministers discussed the ongoing multilateral and bilateral negotiations toward a comprehensive, effectively verifiable and truly global ban on chemical weapons, and instructed their delegations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to continue working constructively in this direction. The secretary and the foreign minister observed a test of the communications link between the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers established under the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center agreement signed on September 15, 1987. The sides held extensive talks on regional questions. They reaffirmed that the goal of the U.S.-Soviet regional dialogue should be to help the parties to regional conflicts find peaceful solutions that advance their independence, freedom and security, and within this context reviewed the situation regarding <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Iran-Iraq, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Contacts and consultations on these issues will continue. The two sides examined the work under way to expand areas of bilateral cooperation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. To continue their discussions on the wide spectrum of issues in U.S.-Soviet relations and to ensure successful preparations for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> agreed to meet again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from April 21-25, 1988, and then again in the middle of May.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the dog, <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> the goat and scores of rabbits, chickens, finches and mice have been declared fauna non grata at the state hospital where they have helped soothe and socialize mental patients. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> is the recreational therapist responsible for the animal farm known since 1970 as the <ORGANIZATION> Stress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Creedmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The hospital has ordered the program to shut down and the animals off the grounds by Friday. `` At this point what I'm doing is putting myself in the position of willing insubordination,'' said <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON>, 48. He said the hospital administration engaged in `` a sham and a dupe job'' by investigating his program. `` We have many concerns,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Amatulli </PERSON> said Wednesday. Chief among them are <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> and his unorthodox approach to protocol in that most bureaucratic of institutions, a state mental hospital. <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> says his eight patients _ down from 16 a few months ago _ feed, groom, exercise and care for about 60 animals. `` It opens them up to wonder. ... It makes them come alive,'' he said of the patients. `` There's an incredible sense of purpose and achievement because they know that these animals are dependent on them.'' `` It's just a really beautiful program,'' said photographer <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, who has been documenting the animal farm on the Queens hospital grounds for 11 months. `` It's just so beautiful to see how not only the animals are nurtured, but the patients are nurtured.'' <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> contends that hospital director <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON> targeted the animal program for elimination shortly after he took over at <LOCATION> Creedmore </LOCATION> about nine months ago. <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON> asked him for information about the patients in the program, which he provided, and then asked him for budgetary and other information. <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> said he refused to provide the information because by that time, he was convinced the hospital only wanted to shut down his program. Among other things, he said, the administration confiscated the stress center's van, which he said was needed to transport both animals and patients. Recently, he said, he and his patients were ordered reassigned and he was told to get rid of the animals. He said he reacted `` maybe arrogantly, maybe defiantly,'' and refused. Ms. <PERSON> Amatulli </PERSON> denied that the hospital set out to destroy <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON>' program. <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON> merely wanted to evaluate its effectiveness and costs, she said, and had no choice but to suspend the program when <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> refused to cooperate. <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Creedmoor </LOCATION> pays $ 200 a year for the program, and that he pays about $ 2,000 annually out of his own pocket for many of its costs. Many thousands of dollars worth of goods and services are donated, he said. <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> has his supporters outside the hospital who have rallied around him every time he has run afoul of the hospital administration. State Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Padavan </PERSON>, who acknowledges `` pulling <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s fat out of the fire for about 10 years,'' said problems with the program mainly involve <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON>' refusal to accommodate bureaucratic procedures, many required by law. <PERSON> Padavan </PERSON> said he will meet with <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON> in about two weeks to see if he can work out a compromise that will save the program. `` The bottom line is that -LRB- <PERSON> Stebbins </PERSON> -RRB- gets very good results,'' said <PERSON> Padavan </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately, he listens to the beat of a different drummer.''

<HEAD>Michigan Media Campaign Lacks Negative Ads Of Earlier Contests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spending for politicial advertisements in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which holds Democratic caucuses on Saturday, has varied widely among the candidates, with some making an all-out effort and others hoarding their resources for later races. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said the campaign was spending about $ 200,000 on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> television. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is using two television ads _ a biography and another spot stressing his executive experience in balancing budgets and creating jobs. <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said a new and `` wholly positive'' ad around the jobs theme would be introduced today. Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, his campaign floundering after Super Tuesday, has much at stake in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. He is running ads in the state, but his campaign declined to say how much money he is spending. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was using a TV biography and his `` Hyundai'' trade spot. The bio features Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., the oldest member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a champion of elderly causes In the trade ad, which helped <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> win <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last month and should have appeal in a car-producing state, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> alleges that tariffs boost the price of a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> K-car to $ 48,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He asks how many $ 48,000 Hyundais the Koreans could sell here. As far as negative ads are concerned, `` there will be no first use here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> but certainly a willingness to respond,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. By Wednesday, no candidate had triggered anything like the punch and counter-punch ads that characterized the races leading up to Super Tuesday, March 8. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> planned a $ 70,000 television campaign in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> starting today, with half of the money to being spent in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The centerpiece was a Bill Cosby endorsement which he has used before. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also is spending $ 20,000 on radio, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Country singer <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> was praising Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> in radio spots around <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is focusing more on the April 5 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary and spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> said he was unlikely to spend money on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> television, although `` you can still buy time. I would n't rule it out.'' The fifth Democrat still in the running, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, is also making a stand in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and plans no TV advertising in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who won last week's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, is making new ads for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and expects to raise enough money in the next 10 days for a $ 100,000-plus TV campaign there.

 Some 370 blacks and women who were rejected for jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will be receiving checks from the company averaging $ 16,200 to settle a discrimination complaint. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, a spokesman for the automaker, stressed that all the workers involved had been hired over the past few years and that the $ 6 million settlement had not been prompted by anyone suing the company for alleged discrimination. `` The matters in this agreement were not raised by any individual at <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Manufacturing,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` They were raised by the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>. No one went to the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement in a settlement signed by the commission Tuesday and announced by both parties Wednesday. `` I think the very fact that it has been reached in good faith and announced indicates that both sides feel it is a fair, just and reasonable agreement,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said. The settlement `` provides $ 6 million in monetary relief and seniority adjustments to the approximately 370 specifically identified black and female individuals who applied for jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> between 1983 and 1986,'' <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It's a significant, large sum that fits into what we considered a just settlement,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>'s systemic investigations division that had worked on the case since September 1984. In addition to the $ 6 million in back pay, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> also was required to provide jobs for all those people by Feb. 29, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. `` They've all been hired in the last couple of years, and they're still working here,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said. `` We have not been required to hire any additional people as a result of this agreement, and we have not hired anyone any earlier than required by our production needs.'' The settlement was among the larger monetary agreements reached in cases where no lawsuit was involved, but the $ 6 million is dwarfed by some other <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> cases, commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. `` We settled a similar charge in 1983 with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> for $ 42 million,'' Ms. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. There was no litigation in that race and sex discrimination case, which involved hundreds of people. In a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> age discrimination case that did involve a lawsuit, the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> settled Feb. 3 for $ 17.2 million shortly before a jury was to return a verdict, she said. The case involved about 100 people. The agreement is the second EEOC-Honda settlement in less than a year. The two parties reached agreement in June 1987 on an age discrimination investigation that provided back pay totaling $ 461,610. That case involved 85 people. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> declined to say whether additional discrimination investigations against <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> were pending. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> also agreed in the new settlement: _ To expand its recruitment area to cover <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and expand specific recruitment efforts for blacks; _ To change promotion procedures and make a commitment to promote additional black and female production workers; _ To teach <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> managers about <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> employs about 5,900 people at manufacturing plants near <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Anna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said he expects the employees to number about 8,600 by 1991 when the company completes a $ 600 million expansion of an engine plant in <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> and a $ 380 million new auto plant in East Liberty, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 The leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-supported Contra rebels signed an agreement Wednesday for a 60-day cease-fire to start April 1, both sides announced in a joint communique. It was the first concrete step toward ending a six-year-old war that has killed more than 40,000 people. Both sides scheduled a meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital, for April 6 to start negotiations on a definitive truce. `` I think, I hope and I believe that we have made a start, a firm start to end this war that is killing ... sons of the same country, sons of the same mothers,'' said Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he hoped a regional peace plan signed last August by the presidents of five Central American nations would `` bury once and for all the military confrontation'' and `` end the hate and strengthen the brotherhood of Nicaraguans.'' `` As president of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, I hope this peace plan becomes a reality,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who had arrived unexpectedly for the announcement. Within the first 15 days of the 60-day truce, the rebels agreed to move into specified zones in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Delegations from both sides scheduled a meeting in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on Monday to work out those zones. The issue of the rebels laying down their arms will be discussed at the April 6 talks. The Contras agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization. That would exclude military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been supporting the Contras since the war began in 1982. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried to revive his stalled effort to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to resume aid to the Contras, which ended Feb. 29. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, announced the details of the agreement after Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, offered a brief prayer asking that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> be blessed for `` all it has suffered.'' Both men attended the three days of talks as observers and signed the agreement as witnesses. Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister and head of the Sandinista delegation, signed for the government and <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> signed for the Contras. The Sandinistas agreed to release 100 Contra prisoners on Sunday and said the rest of the 1,500 jailed rebels would be released at a date to be worked out at the April 6 meeting. The 1,800 former National Guardsmen in prison will be released after a final truce agreement is reached. The army was called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> under the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, who was overthrown by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in July 1979. The government also said it would guarantee freedom of expression without restrictions, in accordance with the regional peace plan. Many press liberties were barred for almost six years under a state-of-emergency decree. The Nicaraguan government said it would grant gradual amnesty and allow all political exiles to return to the country without fear of persecution. It agreed to discuss the issue of military service in a national dialogue with the internal opposition. The meeting at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a town on the Costa Rican border, was the first time the two sides met on Nicaraguan soil. Both Contras and <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> earlier had agreed to a battlefield truce while the negotiations, which began Monday, took place. A reported Contra breach apparently did not affect the talks. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that Contras ambushed an army truck at 2 p.m. Tuesday near <LOCATION> Mulukuku </LOCATION>, in the northern province of <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>, killing two soldiers. It did not appear affect the negotiations. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> told reporters earlier that `` there could be isolated'' truce violations, `` but there is a clear will from both sides to respect that decision.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> again held military exercises staged as what officials called a show of force against Nicaraguan aggression. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the withdrawal would be `` gradual.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected it to come next week. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as the request of the Honduran president, who charged that <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> soldiers had penetrated Honduran territory chasing Contra rebels as part of a major military offensive. The Contras maintain base camps in Honduran territory. At the time, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said it had forced 2,000 Contras out of its territory. Contra forces number an estimated 10,000 troops. At the start of the talks, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had said they would only discuss a cease-fire. Two previous rounds of talks ended in stalemate when the government maintained that position while the Contras insisted on broadening discussions to include political reform within <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But they agreed to discuss political issues with the rebels on Monday after signing an agreement with eight opposition parties in Nicaraguan. The national dialogue as well as the cease-fire are included in the regional peace plan signed by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The peace plan seeks to end civil wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. It also calls for amnesties, democratic reforms and an end to logistical and strategic support for insurgencies.

<HEAD>`Dress Of A Salesman' Age Discrimination Suit Settled Out Of Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wearing a favorite pink sport jacket, a 62-year-old used-car salesman fired over what his boss said were his loud and ugly clothes signed an out-of-court agreement to end an age discrimination suit. `` I believe I have proved my point,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said Wednesday after ending the lawsuit known in courthouse circles as `` The Dress of a Salesman.'' Terms of the settlement, reached the day the trial was scheduled to start, can not be disclosed by either party under the agreement, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnellan </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in his lawsuit against <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> <PERSON> Buick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. But she said, `` We got a good settlement.'' <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON>, did n't immediately return telephone calls to his office Wednesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> charged he was forced out of his job at <ORGANIZATION> Darby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> because of his age even though he was the top salesman with 30 years experience. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said his attire led to his firing in May 1985, 1 -LCB- years after <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> took over management of the dealership from his father, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr </PERSON>. The younger <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> started a `` new image'' campaign and required that sport coats be worn for a more professional look. The 6-foot-8 <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> bought jackets he described as a pale pink and a rainbow plaid. The latter, he said, has every color in it and goes well with his gray slacks or green or red or blue. <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON>, however, contended in court documents that <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was stubbornly resisting the new image campaign. `` One jacket was multi-colored ... and the other was a loud fuchsia,'' he said. <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> had other irritating habits, such as catnapping on the job. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said he only took a few winks, a habit he acquired when the elder <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> was in control of the dealership. `` I wanted those sport coats vindicated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Donnellan </PERSON> said. `` They are n't really that bad.''

<HEAD>NC Lawmaker Rebuked For Personal Borrowing On Campaign Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has formally rebuked Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION> for improper use of campaign funds but recommended against further punishment for his violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. The ethics panel wrote <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> on Wednesday that it found `` clear and convincing'' evidence he improperly borrowed funds from his campaign and then failed to report the loans on his public financial disclosure reports. In addition, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> wrongly pledged a certificate of deposit from his campaign as collateral on a personal loan and failed to report liabilities to financial institutions on his public disclosure statements, the committee found. The panel, formally the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, said those actions violate House rules. The personal benefit <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> received in each instance of borrowing, and the lower interest rate received from use of the certificate of deposit, `` are the kinds of abuses'' the rules are designed to prevent, the committee said. The panel told <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> his behavior was `` deserving of reproach.'' But in concluding no further punishment was needed against the eight-term lawmaker, the committee noted that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> tried to correct his mistakes. `` The committee recognizes and takes into consideration the fact that all funds borrowed were replaced in full without the insistence of this committee, and that this action was taken by you prior to this committee beginning a preliminary inquiry,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was told in the letter, signed by panel Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. and ranking Republican <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> `` Furthermore, the committee recognizes that the campaign certificate of deposit in question is no longer encumbered, due to restrictions placed on it in connection with your personal financial dealings.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said, `` I am very happy that the committee found that no further action was warranted, other than the letter to me.'' He said he would not resign and described his violations as `` technical.'' A House rule restricts the use of campaign funds to bona fide campaign purposes. The committee called the requirement `` crucial to maintaining public confidence in the fund-raising system governing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. `` The use of your campaign funds, as alleged and proved, is entirely inconsistent with this principle,'' the committee letter said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 48, was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. He is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on tobacco and peanuts. The lawmaker said he was disappointed the committee did not accept his contention that money he took from his campaign amounted to repayment of loans. He said he apologized for signing his name to the certificate of deposit, contending he had n't known doing so violated House rules.

 The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Thursday, while stock prices also fell moderately. After opening at 126.75 yen, the dollar slid further and closed at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen from its close of 127.15 yen on Wednesday. It ranged between 126.15 and 126.81 yen.

Stock investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines to wait out the results of the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, said <PERSON> Hiromi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoneyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>AIDS Study Finds 15 Percent Of Incoming Inmates Test Positive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 15 percent of inmates entering state prison from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have tested positive for the AIDS virus, officials say. The finding, from anonymous blood tests of 500 inmates over two weeks early this year or late last year, will prompt further anonymous tests, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>, a spokesman for state Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>. The blood tests were part of a state program to check more than 100,000 blood samples statewide in an attempt to determine how far acquired immune deficiency syndrome has spread, <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> said Wednesday. The blood samples are being collected at prisons, where all entering inmates are tested, as well as at family planning clinics, tuberculosis clinics and other health centers, he said. About 70 percent of the prison system's 41,559 inmates come from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which has the nation's highest concentration of AIDS victims. The inmate test results were disclosed after state Sen. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> and Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, and called for the prison system to offer AIDS tests to inmates about to be released. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> told him that tests had indicated between 15 percent and 20 percent of the inmates might be carrying the AIDS virus. The senator said that with about 16,000 inmates being released annually, there could be 2,400 or more who are infected and do n't know it <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> was making `` a crude extrapolation based on very limited data'' that might not give a clear picture of the prison system as a whole. <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> must have been basing his projections on what <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> had told him about blood tests from inmates entering the system at Downstate state prison in <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Corrections spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON> said inmates are now tested for the virus only on a doctor's orders for diagnostic purposes. <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON> said that as of the end of last year there had been 597 confirmed cases of AIDS among inmates. Of those, 346 died in prison, 152 had been released and 99 remained in custody. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> have resisted calls for mandatory AIDS testing of inmates and have thus far refused to permit voluntary testing in prisons. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said he would propose legislation to require it. <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> said inmates about to be released are given counseling about AIDS. Some researchers have estimated that up to 50 percent of those testing positive for the virus will develop the deadly disease, which cripples the body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to infections and cancer. Most cases of AIDS have appeared in homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers. By March 21, 57,024 AIDS cases were reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and 31,836 victims have died.

<HEAD>Study Says Nature, More Than Nurture, Rules Longevity</HEAD>

 Whether people die young or have normal lifespans appears to be ruled more by their genes than their upbringing, a study today concludes. The research, conducted in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, was based on a followup of infants who were separated from their parents at birth. If the biologic parents died at an early age, there was an increased chance that their children would die during their first five decades, as well. But there was no such link with the deaths of adoptive parents. `` We conclude that premature death in adults has a strong genetic background _ especially death due to infections and vascular causes,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Thorkild </PERSON> <PERSON> I.A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Hvidovre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>. By contrast, they wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, they found that early death from cancer appears to be associated with behavior learned in the family. Researchers have long known that some diseases, such as heart attacks and some forms of cancer, run in families. But it is often unclear how much of the risk is inherited and how much results from living habits that people pick up from their parents. The Danish study, based on people who never lived with their biological parents, helps sort out these factors. It suggests that genes play the largest role in determining whether people will die at unusually young ages. The researchers wrote, `` The family environment apparently had no effect'' on the overall mortality rate from natural causes, although such influences can not be ruled out. The researchers studied 960 families who gave up their children for adoption between 1924 and 1926. They looked at whether the adoptees died between ages 16 and 58 and whether their biological or adoptive parents had died of the same causes by age 50. Among the findings: _ If a biological mother or father died of natural causes before age 50, this doubled the risk of premature death for their child However, there was no association between the deaths of adoptive parents and their children. _ If a biological parent died of an infection before age 50, the mortality rate among the adoptees from infections was five times higher than usual The researchers said that suggests the strength of people's immune systems is inherited. _ Vascular disease that underlies heart trouble and stroke also were strongly influenced by inheritance If a biological parent died early of this disease, the child was five times more likely than the others to die of this cause. _ In cancer, the situation was reversed Those whose adoptive parents died before 50 of cancer had a five-fold increased risk of dying themselves of cancer. But the adoptees' cancer death risk was not increased if the biological parents died of cancer. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> said the research provided `` splendid data.'' But he said it should not be used to argue that family habits do n't contribute to heart disease or that genes never play a role in cancer

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials say they probably will let the chips fall where they may in the Meadow Muffin Match Up, which could be an illegal lottery. About 2,000 people have bought $ 5 tickets for a chance to win $ 1,500 on April 30 when a cow is allowed on the <ORGANIZATION> Coppell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> football field. The field is divided into a grid, and the owner of the first square with a cow hit will receive the prize money. The event is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Coppell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher-Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and money raised will go toward a college scholarship fund and the purchase of a school laminating machine. County officials downwind from the suburb caught a whiff of the event and said it is gambling. `` I do n't write the laws, I just enforce them,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Keck </PERSON>, assistant district attorney. `` I think it's got some real liability problems.'' But <PERSON> Keck </PERSON> said officials may ignore the event and let ticket holders take their chances. `` No one is likely to file a complaint,'' <PERSON> Keck </PERSON> said. An official with the state attorney general's office said that although the money is being raised for a good cause, it is still gambling. But PTSA President <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't imagine anyone being ornery enough to try to stop us from trying to help our kids.'' <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PTSA </ORGANIZATION> member, said some parents thought the event was a little off-color. `` I have to admit that at first I thought it was a gross idea,'' she said. `` But we all went home and thought about it ... and we were able to see the humor in it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PTSA </ORGANIZATION> first considered using a horse instead of a cow. `` But horses drop a lot,'' she said. `` And we would end up owing the world a lot of money.''

 Amid the deafening boom of live mortar fire and the sizzling heat of a Honduran spring, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers practiced for battle but thought about going home soon. A Honduran artillery school in the sprawling pine-covered mountains of south-central <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, was the setting Wednesday for training exercises between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Honduran troops. About 120 soldiers worked together, loading and firing mortars and howitzers, radioing messages from the field, plotting diagrams of make-believe enemy positions and cheering when the artillery hit its mark a mile away. Officers from both countries said the training was worthwhile. `` We're learning to adapt our ways to different areas,'' said Cpl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` I'm learning Spanish,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>, commander of the Honduran company taking part in the exercises, said his soldiers do not often get a chance to use live artillery. Money is scarce in this country, so the exercises are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funded. `` We do n't have enough ammunition to last the whole year, so while they're here we take advantage of the opportunity to use live ammunition,'' he said. All the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers training at <LOCATION> Zambrano </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, are from the 82nd Airborne Division based at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rushed 3,200 American soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week after Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said Sandinista troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had pursued U.S.-backed Contra rebels into Honduran territory. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the Americans were in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as an emergency training exercise meant to show support for <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>. Late Wednesday, a Honduran military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 300 Nicaraguan troops entered <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> territory in the region where Sandinista soldiers had fought Contra rebels last week. `` Because of that, the state of alert continues for all combat units of the armed forces,'' said the source. The location was given as the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> province, but no other details were available. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said earlier Wednesday that, unless the military situation in the region changed, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers tentatively will return home early next week. Cpl. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, 22, who took time out from artillery practice to read letters from his fiancee in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, said he hoped he would be home in time for his June 18 wedding. He said he was `` relieved, very relieved'' when he learned that Sandinista forces had retreated last week and that truce talks between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras had begun in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We came down here to do what we had to do in any way, shape or form,'' he said from behind a 105mm howitzer. `` But if we can keep from firing one shot and the problems still get resolved, then that's great,'' he said. Some soldiers said their trip to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest countries, had been an eye-opener. `` The children come running up to you for chocolate and money. And the way they live _ it makes you feel lucky to live in a house,'' said Spec. 4 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It makes you want to get back home so badly.''

 The only <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members to vote against a resolution condemning a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer mission were <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The non-binding resolution was approved 148-2 on Wednesday, a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in federal court seeking to close the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> townhouse where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has its offices. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> vowed to fight the attempted closure, mandated by an anti-terrorism law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calls on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to obey the international <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters treaty, which permits foreign missions to operate and calls for arbitration of any dispute with the host country. `` What pride do you have in throwing your guests out?'' shouted <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> after the vote. `` Is this the message the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation wants to bring to the world? That guests have no respect, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has no respect, international law has no respect?'' he asked. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said it will not take any physical steps against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until the issue has been settled in court. `` Let me assure you, we will not disregard the summons by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>. `` But we will tell the court this is a dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that the only forum where such a dispute can be settled is found in section 21 of the Headquarters agreement.'' Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> rose to denounce the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for, as he put it, seeking the protection of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter as it pursues a goal contrary to that charter: the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, since its inception, has been the principal terrorist organization of our time. It has systematically targeted and murdered innocent civilians,'' said <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which has retained former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> as its counsel, has 20 days from the filing of the lawsuit on Tuesday to respond. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> announced it will file a brief in support of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense motion. It retained attorney <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Highet </PERSON>, who is also president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. Sixty-five American organizations and citizens filed suit on Wednesday in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> challenging the Anti-Terrorism Act. They included former <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hostage Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, author <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit argues that the law infringes on the constitutional right of Americans to hear all sides of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> controversy by barring the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from public debate. A March 29 hearing date was set in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Witnesses in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> today said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters circled the skies to guard against unrest after the government described Armenian claims to an area in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> as intolerable. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said a correspondent for an unofficial human rights journal had called from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to say that helicopters were patrolling the city, but that there was no widespread disorder reported. <PERSON> Regyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON>, a senior editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, confirmed in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that there were helicopters overhead, but described the city as calm. He said most Armenians were showing patience in awaiting resolution of the contentious national issue. Armenians want the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> because more than three-quarters of the population in the region is Armenian. The annexation appeal was rejected by the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in early February, which triggered massive demonstrations in the region that is smaller than the state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The unrest spread to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> in late February, when hundreds of thousands of Armenians marched through the streets bearing banners linking the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> issue with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s social reforms. The <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> demonstrations subsided after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for calm and promised a party review of the annexation question. But the issue touched off rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Feb. 28, when at least 32 people were killed in a rampage by ethnic extremists. Soviet officials reported earlier this week that 197 people were injured in the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> rioting and that more than 400 have been arrested or charged in murders, rapes, looting and other violent acts. Armenian activists claim the casualties were much higher and predominently among Armenians at the hands of enraged Azeris, the dominant population of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON>, the newspaper editor, said soldiers were deployed around <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to ensure order today, but no outbreaks of unrest had occurred to his knowledge since a government statement on the issue was made public Wednesday night. The demonstrations had subsided until early this week, when reports in the party daily Pravda said the annexation drive had a `` clear anti-socialist spirit.'' Activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> said about 7,000 people protested that report, and one of the journalists whose name had been attached to it disavowed it. As recently as March 17, party officials in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> appealed for permission to join the Armenian republic. Activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> had called for another show of support for the annexation appeal with demonstrations and strikes beginning Saturday, when a self-appointed committee of activists and officials plans to meet and discuss a future course of action. <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON>, a 32-year-old candidate for membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he supports the proposal for returning <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but does n't expect the matter to be resolved soon. `` I believe that some day it will be united with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but in the nearest days I do n't expect this to happen. It is a very complicated issue, and I think most people understand that now,'' he said. He said he did not expect a large turnout at the demonstrations or widespread participation in the strikes called for by activists, although Moscow-based dissidents say they've been told thousands plan to show their support for the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> appeal by taking to the streets. The Soviet government on Wednesday rejected as `` intolerable'' the Armenian campaign for annexation, indicating it would not bend to the pressures brought to bear by demonstrations and strikes. The meeting, attended by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and other senior party officials, was held after carefully orchestrated appeals by subordinate legislative bodies in 13 Soviet republics _ all but <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, considered it `` intolerable when it is attempted to resolve complicated national-territorial issues through pressure on state authorities, in an atmosphere when emotions and passions are whipped up.'' The statement did not categorically deny the appeal, but declared that such issues would be resolved on the basis of economic concerns rather than ethnic differences.

<TEXT>
 `` Nightline'' anchor <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> has agreed to a long-term contract that will keep him at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> but allow him to produce his own prime-time programs, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> had been working without a contract since last year, and there was spculation he might leave <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> to start his own production company to make a syndicated version of `` Nightline,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. He has anchored the late-night program since it started in 1980 and has been linked to its success largely through his diplomatic yet confrontational interviewing style. Under the new arrangement, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> will get similar benefits as he has now, with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> agreeing to broadcast `` Nightline'' five nights a week. <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> will be host for most, but not all of the broadcasts. In addition, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> will get his own production company, which will produce each year at least four hour-long news programs to air in prime-time. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will pay him for the right to broadcast those programs. <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>'s company also will have the right to produce television programs that could be broadcast outside <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, according to the unidentified executives by the Times. <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the deal was agreed on but not signed. <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> did not return several telephone calls to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, the Times said.

<TEXT>
 A convicted former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive, who has confessed to stealing $ 1.5 million from the bankrupt defense contractor, admitted he has not had to give back any of his illegal earnings. Under cross examination by the defense at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six others Wednesday, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> was asked about his plea bargain with federal prosecutors. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> got <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> to admit he sought to avoid a racketeering charge `` which could carry up to 20 years in prison and forfeiting your assets.'' `` And you told your lawyer you did n't want that, right?'' asked <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>, `` and that is one of the things they negotiated and got for you, is n't that right?'' `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who later admitted his lawyer also got `` one of the most lenient judges'' to take his guilty plea. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> is among four ex-Wedtech officials who have admitted bribing public officials and other state and federal crimes in a plea bargain for leniency. All are cooperating witnesses for the prosecution. None have yet been sentenced. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> faces a maximum 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to federal charges of bribe conspiracy and mail fraud. He also faces an additional seven years after pleading guilty to state larceny and bribery charges. <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> also got <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> to admit that `` not a penny'' of his assets have been seized or forfeited despite his numerous guilty pleas. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, his eldest son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and four others are charged with turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor, into a vehicle for paying millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government no-bid contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, currently in bankruptcy proceedings, grew from a small machine shop into a $ 100-million-a-year business through a series of no-bid contracts set aside for companies controlled by minority group members. Earlier, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> claimed attorneys at the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ellenoff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Plesent </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> were aware of another <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scheme to make it appear the company was minority controlled in order to qualify for no-bid contracts. He said the lawyers knew the agreement to sell majority control of the stock to <LOCATION> Mariotta </LOCATION>, who is of Hispanic descent, was `` a sham.'' `` So they participated in your fraud, is what you are telling us, right?'' asked <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' replied <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> after a short pause. <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>, a partner in the firm, later issued a statement calling <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s testimony `` untrue.'' `` Neither he nor anybody else from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> advised anybody at this firm that Mr. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> had agreed not to buy shares of stock pursuant to the purchase agreement,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>, noting that <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> previously testified he and other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials concealed other illegal activities from the law firm and `` if there was such an agreement with Mr. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, it too was concealed.''

<HEAD>Storm Brings Snow, High Winds to Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 High winds and snow today buffeted mountain areas of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which braced for gusts up to 80 mph and more than a foot of snow from a fast-moving cold front. Strong winds blew through sections of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Showers and thundershowers fell in much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. A warning for heavy snow was issued for the northern mountains of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where 8 to 14 inches was expected. The snow and winds predicted to hit 80 mph were expected to create blizzard conditions. An advisory for snow and blowing snow was posted for the mountains of southeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where 4 to 8 inches was expected. On Wednesday, the front spawned 80 mph winds in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, forcing <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials to cancel military helicopter flights and training with anti-tank missiles at the <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Up to 18 inches of snow fell Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION>, and a snow advisory remained in effect for the mountains.

<TEXT>
 Only after Soviet television broadcast a 1 -LCB- - hour speech by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on agriculture and news on a territorial dispute did viewers learn President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet their leader in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May The brief announcement came about 11 p.m. Wednesday, two hours into the news program `` Vremya,'' or Time, which has an estimated audience of 150 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, announced the summit in a one-paragraph dispatch issued more than 2 -LCB- hours earlier. `` Vremya'' showed videotape of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meeting Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> outside the White House earlier in the day. An announcer said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reported that the superpowers settled on the dates of May 29 through June 2 for the meeting, his fourth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and first trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The five-day visit will mark the first trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by an <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 1974 summer meeting with <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` Vremya'' customarily lasts an hour or less, but its lead item Wednesday was a long speech by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, at the opening of a collective farmers congress. His remarks, which lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes, apparently were broadcast in their entirety. The evening newscast also reported that the Soviet government rejected as `` intolerable'' a campaign by <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian area of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. That campaign fueled ethnic strife that led to rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Feb. 28. Officials say 32 people died. State-run media had no initial comment about the summit, whose projected centerpiece is the signing of a treaty now being negotiated that would reduce long-range nuclear weapons on both sides by 30 percent to 50 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave no details in its dispatch beyond the time and place fixed for the meeting.

Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> said she enrolled in an anti-smoking clinic after her children said the legal wrangling was `` ludicrous.'' Besides, she added, `` I'm coughing like crazy.

Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two men fired rocket-propelled grenades at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, slightly damaging the roof in an attack a leftist guerrilla group claimed was a response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. No one was hurt in the Wednesday night attack in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> ordered the temporary suspension of arrest orders for five members of the cocaine-trafficking <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel wanted for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Wednesday, gunmen ambushed and killed the security chief of a newspaper that had urged the government not to back down in its war on drug traffickers, police said. The suspension of the arrest orders is almost certain to bring an angry reaction from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, who have begun to question the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's position on rounding up drug traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the only damage from the grenade attack on the building was to the roof, which sustained minor damage. They said one grenade apparently hit a security fence and exploded in the air. The two assailants fled in a taxi, people at a restaurant across the street from the embassy told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter. <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police and the army set up roadblocks throughout the capital in an attempt to catch the assailants. Anonymous callers to two television stations said the attack was staged by the <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigade </PERSON> of the M-19 leftist guerrilla group. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military ruler when died in a 1981 plane crash. M-19 pamphlets found outside a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station said the attack was a response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is trying through economic sanctions to force <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>' successor, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, into exile. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine. About 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers were sent into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as a show of force after Nicaraguan troops allegedly chased Contra rebels into Honduran territory. In <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION> newspaper security chief <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was hit by five bullets fired by three men on motorcycles as he and his family were waiting for a taxi near their home, police said. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON>'s 10-month-old daughter was grazed by a bullet and in satisfactory condition. His wife was not hurt. Police said they did n't know who was responsible for the killing. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> paper he worked for has urged the government not to give in to drug traffickers, many of whom live in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Colombian drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an attorney general, 21 judges, two newspaper editors and scores of policemen and soldiers in the last four years. The suspension of arrest orders for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel applies to its alleged leaders: <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and three brothers, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buitrago </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said the suspensions were ordered while the government studies possible charges in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> against the five men. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s wife and 25 of his guards appeared Wednesday before a judge in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> after a shootout at <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s home near that northwest Colombian city <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> apparently was at home when the shootout began Tuesday but escaped.

 Most Americans believe Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> should not be pardoned before he goes on trial on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra controversy, according to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times-CBS News poll. The poll found that 64 percent opposed a pardon for North before a trial while 27 percent favored such a pardon. The party affiliation of those interviewed by telephone for the poll did not appear to change results, the Times reported today. The poll also found that a majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should not have sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week. Fifty-two percent said the troops should not have been sent, while 35 percent said they should have been and 13 percent said they did not know, according to the poll. The poll, based on interviews of 1,654 people nationwide between Friday and Tuesday, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. Americans split evenly on whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> should be pardoned if convicted, with 43 percent for and 43 percent against. By a 2-to-1 margin, those surveyed said he was a `` real patriot'' but they said by the same margin that he `` went too far with his actions,'' the newspaper said. The poll also found that 53 percent of the respondents were more concerned about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> getting involved in a war in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> than about a communist takeover in the area. Thirty-seven percent were more worried about a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover, while 4 percent said the factors were equal and 2 percent said they were worried about neither. Four percent said they did not know. Forty-eight percent of those surveyed did not think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be giving military aid to the Contras while 39 percent said the aid should be given and 13 percent said they did not know.

<HEAD>Possible Water Shortage Already Causing Battles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A critical water shortage east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> threatens to pit suburban homeowners against city dwellers as officials consider the most severe water conservation measures since a 1977 drought. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> engineers said Wednesday that low precipitation since October means river runoffs from snow melt will be 40 percent below normal statewide between April and July _ and even lower if spring rainfall is below average. East Bay Municipal Utility District reservoirs that are half-full now could be one-quarter full by September unless there are major storms during the next two months, officials said. The district board declared a `` water shortage emergency'' Tuesday and warned that as of June 1, they may ration water to their 1.1 million customers for the first time in a decade. The district, however, already is divided over whether to allow more water in warmer, drier areas such as the affluent <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> than in the often foggy and rainy inner-cities should rationing becomes necessary. `` We are the hot weather part of the district. Our needs are different than the cooler parts of the district,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, a middle-class community about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Utility board directors from urban <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> argued it would be unfair for the suburbs, with their sprawling lawns and gardens, to receive an extra share. If a voluntary conservation plan approved by the district fails, the agency may impose water restrictions of up to 25 percent for homes and businesses in inland counties like <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> from May through September. During the drought 11 years ago, water customers were charged up to ten times the normal rate for excessive water use. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and coastal counties face possible water shortages next year, but are in better shape than the inland counties because they have more water sources and have received more storms.

<TEXT>
 Angry rightist leaders accused the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> of trying to steal this week's legislative and municipal elections by manipulating returns The charge of attempted fraud was made Wednesday by leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena. They warned that violence could occur if the incumbents continued the alleged attempt to rig results. Hours after polls closed, leaders of all the parties recognized <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> as the big winner in Sunday's vote. Comments Monday by <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, implied <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> would have at least 30 seats in the new 60-seat National Assembly, the unicameral legislature. Arena had said Tuesday its projections gave it 35 seats, but the party said Wednesday it had 31 seats guaranteed. The election panel, an independent body including representatives of the three major parties, has repeatedly postponed announcement of official nationwide results. <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said on Wednesday the commission has received several challenges to preliminary official results reported from various provinces, and that final official results would be withheld until those challenges were resolved. Arena founder <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, an ex-army major and alleged leader of early 1980s death squads, said at the news conference, `` If they continue with this fraud that they're trying to pull off, who knows what could happen here.'' Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, or ANEP, called a news conference to back <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s claim and warn against attempts to manipulate results. They held out the possibility of a business strike if the gathering of official results is flawed. `` If there is an attempt at fraud, there could be a violent public reaction that would endanger the institutional existence of the country,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ANEP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaverria </PERSON>. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> called on the armed forces' high command to ensure the honesty of the vote count. `` If they do not, the accusing finger will point to them too,'' he said. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacayo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president of the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, denied the fraud allegations. `` The leaders of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, being the experts in psychological warfare that they are, raised expectations with inflated early returns,'' he told reporters. He said his party's figures gave <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> 27 to 28 deputies, with 25 to 26 for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Such a final tally could leave the balance of legislative power with smaller parties.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said he's going out of his mind not preaching, but he expects to be back within three months and urged his followers to ignore `` innuendos that are flying like confetti.'' `` This ministry is not going down, it's not ever faltering,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> told a congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> here Wednesday night. On Monday, the 250-member General Presbytery of the Assemblies of God church plans to decide the fate of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who tearfully confessed on the pulpit Feb. 21 that he had sinned. He has been following a three-month suspension recommended by state church leaders. The Executive Presbytery of the church met soon afterward in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and sent a harsher recommendation back to the state council, calling for a year's suspension from the pulpit. But after meeting again, the state council voted to return its original recommendation to the executive council of the church, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination. A final decision will be made by the General Presbytery. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who occasionally addresses his old congregation at services conducted by his assistant pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, indicated on Wednesday that he expects the presbyters to approve the three-month suspension. He told about 400 congregants that he was going out of his mind away from his pulpit, but `` when I'm back in the pulpit on May 22, I'll be back in my mind.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> urged the congregation ignore `` innuendos that are flying like confetti'' and said he believes that God is going to help his ministry `` touch the world like it's never been touched before.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, whose television broadcasts reach several countries, took in an estimated $ 150 million in 1986. Church officials have confirmed that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, one of the nation's most popular television evangelists, was photographed with a known prostitute outside a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area motel last October. A woman who claimed she was that prostitute said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to perform pornographic acts. Also Wednesday, a state district court jury in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> held that a radio station owned by the Swaggart organization owes $ 28,000 in real estate taxes, instead of the $ 64,043 claimed by the city of <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION>. The jury voted 10-2 Wednesday that the ministries should pay the smaller amount because only half of the building was a church and the other real estate and leased property. The ministry had claimed the radio station qualifies as a place of worship, and therefore was tax exempt.

<TEXT>
 Journalists and white civil rights activists held demonstrations in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> today to protest the government's closure of an anti-apartheid newspaper. The latest edition of the New Nation, a black-oriented weekly published by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was to have gone on sale today. But on Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> ordered the paper shut down for 12 weeks, saying it had published `` subversive propaganda'' in violation of state-of-emergency censorship regulations. More than 30 journalists from the New Nation, the liberal Weekly Mail, and The Star, the country's largest-selling daily, held up placards at busy downtown intersections during the morning rush hour. `` Hands off the press,'' read one placard. Another asked, `` Who's next?'' on one side, and answered, `` You're next.'' on the other. White women from the Black Sash civil rights group held a similar demonstration outside the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Their placards read: `` Press in chains'' and `` Free New Nation.'' The Weekly Mail is among six other anti-apartheid publications notified by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that they face possible closure or appointment of an in-house censor if they continue carrying material that dissatisfies the minister. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. In other developments: _ Administrators at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION>, a college for blacks in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province, today announced that student dormitories have been closed indefinitely because of disruptions and vandalism on campus The university's rector, P.C. <PERSON> Mokgokong </PERSON>, said the trouble began after politically oriented boycotts of classes Friday and Monday. When classes resumed Tuesday, the rector said, there was an upsurge of `` anti-social and criminal conduct'' he blamed on militant students. _ Police said a 23-year-old female constable was shot and killed Wednesday night while sitting in a car with her boyfriend near the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> Police said the constable, of Indian descent, was shot by a black assailant after another had smashed the car window with a brick.

<TEXT>
 A renowned caviar expert and a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> roe dealer are accused of importing $ 1 million worth of Iranian caviar in violation of a presidential trade embargo with that Middle Eastern nation. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, 49, a wholesaler and author of `` Caviar! Caviar! Caviar!'' and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachelier </PERSON>, 32, a caviar dealer, are charged with violating the Oct. 29, 1987, ban on Iranian imports, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. `` I'm innocent,'' <PERSON> Bachelier </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. `` It's a mistake.'' Telephone calls to <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'s wholesale company went unanswered. If convicted as charged, the two could face up to 16 years in prison and $ 150,000 in fines, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said when the agency announced its case Wednesday. The fish-egg probe began last December when customs officials received a tip about illegal Iranian caviar, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. Customs agents believe that <PERSON> Bachelier </PERSON> sent Iranian caviar to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the shipments were disguised as Soviet caviar and then flown to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The caviar was in fact falsely labeled in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in order to circumvent the embargo,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` After the cavier was released by customs, <PERSON> Bachelier </PERSON> would transfer the caviar into Iranian tins, which he had imported separately,'' said <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. Customs agents followed a one-ton shipment from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before search warrants were served March 15, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. The search netted 1,400 pounds of caviar worth $ 400,000 at <ORGANIZATION> Caspian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caviar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 1,000 pounds of caviar worth $ 400,000 at <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'s firm, <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caviar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and 1,000 pounds of caviar worth $ 200,000 at <ORGANIZATION> Epicurean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, company, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> is scheduled for an appearance at federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> April 5 and <PERSON> Bachelier </PERSON> was arraigned March 16. The seized caviar is on ice as evidence. <PERSON> Bachelier </PERSON> said he imported some Iranian caviar under a permit issued to a person he declined to identify. The rest of the caviar was genuine Russian caviar, he said. `` I feel like I'm being treated unfairly,'' he said. `` I'm innocent I have nothing to fear.''

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is recalling about 4,900 1988 Chevrolet Corvettes to fix defective wheel welds that could cause the wheel center to separate from the rim during braking or cornering. The automaker said Wednesday it is also recalling about 460 1987 GMC and Chevrolet full-size vans to correct fuel tank filler pipes that could cause fuel to leak during refueling or turning. No accidents or injuries have been linked to either problem, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. Vehicle owners are being notified of the recall by dealers, who will correct the problems at no charge, the company said. The Corvettes, all equipped with 17-inch wheels, may be missing a weld on some wheels, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The condition could result in partial loss of steering control and a sudden changed in vehicle direction, the automaker said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, almost certain to become <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s next president, is promising a fraud-free election in the state that allegedly was a hotbed of bogus balloting two years ago. `` I come with the firm decision to respect the will of the people of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>,'' he said at the outset of his five-day campaign swing through the northern border state of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states. The trip that concludes Friday is being watched closely throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The Chihuahua Case'' has become shorthand for alleged fraud that took place during state and local elections in 1986. At that time, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dealt a major setback to its rival <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which had won an unprecedented victory in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> three years earlier. The governing party never has lost a presidential election or a gubernatorial race since its inception in 1929. As the party's candidate, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> is virtually certain to win a six-year term on Dec. 1 and succeed President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. `` I come here with you to outline the strong commitment to govern with absolute respect for democracy,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said during his <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> campaign. `` Of course we are going to war; that's why we come to <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> _ to win.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> stopped in the southern towns of <LOCATION> Parral </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delicias </PERSON> before returning to the state capital, the city of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. All were won by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 and regained by the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> party in 1986. A campaign official, who asked not to be named, said crowds of more than 5,000 people in those towns were considered a major achievement. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won seven mayoralties in 1983, including the state capital and <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> on the border with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It predicted an even greater victory three years later, but <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s party won 65 of 67 mayoralties, the governorship and all 14 state legislative posts at stake. It insisted throughout that the vote was fair.

 A federal judge says Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division can not take part in the department's criminal investigation of alleged harassment of a black <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> are parties to a civil lawsuit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, alleging racial harrassment by white <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents against agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said Wednesday he wants a `` Chinese wall'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys handling the criminal investigation and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> suspended a grand jury investigation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> until government lawyers file a statement agreeing to abide by the order barring <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> from having access to the criminal file. `` The grand jury, the court and the public have a right to know that the grand jury proceedings are in the hands of persons who have no apparent interest other than to ascertain the truth,'' <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said in response to a request by <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s attorney. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said late Wednesday that the department had just become aware of <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>'s ruling and it would have to be reviewed before there was any comment. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, 37, now assigned to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, filed suit Nov. 5 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, accusing white fellow agents in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, of racial harassment and threats of death and mutilation against him or sexual assault against his wife, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, who is white. They are now separated. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has upheld <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s racial discrimination allegations in connection with his stay in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> in 1983 and 1984. `` Supervisory and high-level officials of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> never confronted, stopped, investigated or even took seriously the sometimes daily racial degradation and the blatantly discriminatory employment actions,'' <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s lawsuit contended. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> initiated the grand jury investigation after <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s suit was filed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also has conducted inquiries into <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s allegations. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, an attorney for <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s former girlfriend, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Peszko </PERSON>, said Wednesday the woman was pressured by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to make false statements about <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Peszko </PERSON> was interrogated for 20 hours over a three-day period earlier this month regarding her relationship with <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Peszko </PERSON> said in an affidavit the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> took advantage of her emotional state after a lovers' quarrel and pressured her to make statements she feared were inaccurate. She said she did not want those statements used against <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. `` They wanted me to sign statements they prepared, but I refused,'' she said. `` I did not and do not intend to hurt <PERSON> Don </PERSON>, whom I love, and I was misled by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s frequently saying that all they wanted to do was help <PERSON> Don </PERSON> by my saying what they wanted to hear.'' `` I was so tired, hungry and upset, I do not know what I told them or whether what they wrote down is accurate,'' she said. `` They were often suggesting things and leading me in certain directions, and much of what is in the statements they have may well be inaccurate.'' Two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> apparently tried to persuade Ms. <PERSON> Peszko </PERSON> to say that <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> first hit her during an argument March 4 at an apartment they shared in <LOCATION> Pennsauken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, then broke his own nose to convince investigators both had been acting violently, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Peszko </PERSON> filed simple assault charges against each other in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, then dropped them. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the questioning followed normal procedures taken any time allegations of impropriety or criminal wrongdoing are leveled against an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> employee.

A copy of the proposed transaction, marked `` urgent'' and `` confidential'' was provided to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> He was informed of the possible transaction last Saturday by <LOCATION> AmeriChina </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wanta </PERSON> discussed the deal with him unaware that <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> had broken with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> almost a month ago and has remained loyal to ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. At <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>'s request, <PERSON> Wanta </PERSON> sent him a telecopy of the proposed deal, which was addressed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and to his chief of <ORGANIZATION> Ordnance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Corro </PERSON>. The arms package is worth more than $ 10 million. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said there was no legal way the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government could block the transaction because the pistols are not of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> origin. But they expressed keen interest in a reference at the bottom of proposal to an apparent request by the Panamanian military for M-16 rifles. The reference asked whether <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had reached any decision on the `` procurement-delivery'' of the M-16's. Any such request would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval and would be rejected, said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, insisting on anonymity. The M-16 is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A Colt official, who asked not to be identified, said Colt would never export the M-16 without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government approval. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had no record of any company by the name of <PERSON> AmeriChina </PERSON>. They said all companies that manufacture or export weapons must register with the government and that failure to do so carries stiff penalties. Reached by telephone at his <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Wanta </PERSON> asked how the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> had obtained a copy of his memo to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and was indignant when he was told of <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>'s role. `` You tell <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> he will have a lot of explaining to do in about 12 minutes,'' Wanta said. He then hung up. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said that in his conversation last Saturday with Wanta, the arms dealer had asked for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military attache but <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> took the call himself because the attache no longer shows up at the embassy. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said he felt it was his duty to make the proposed deal public because of the possibility that the weapons might be used against the Panamanian people. The pistols are to be sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the country where the weapon was originally commissioned more than 50 years ago. The weapons are described as `` high-power'' with fixed sights. The price listed is $ 398 each. The delivery schedule calls for shipment of 5,000 of the pistols immediately and an additional 2,000 units per month thereafter `` until 25,000 units are delivered.'' There are an estimated 10,000 to 11,000 members of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> They are supplemented by undisclosed numbers of paramilitary forces and militia.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes divebombed Palestinian guerrilla bases on the outskirts of this southern port city today for the second day, killing nine people and wounding five, police said. A police spokesman said six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fighter-bombers hit the bases six times in 55 minutes with 30 rockets and bombs, starting at 1 p.m. The bases were manned by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, police said. It was the third Israeli strike against Palestinian bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a week and the fifth this year. Forty-seven people have been killed and 6 wounded in Israeli air strikes on guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. An Israeli army statement identified the targets as buildings used by the guerrillas to store weapons and equipment. The statement said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pilots returned safely and reported accurate hits on the targets. Smoke and dust engulfed the villages of <LOCATION> Bekasta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Majdelyoun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Saliyeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abra </PERSON> after the raids, and ambulances raced to the scene. All but <PERSON> Abra </PERSON> had been bombed by Israeli jets Wednesday. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity under standing regulations, said guerrillas sealed off the villages on the southern and eastern edges of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The villages were once populated by Christians. But they fled in April 1985 when leftist Moslem militiamen drove right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> irregulars, allied with the Israelis, out of the region. Police said seven people were killed and 15 wounded when 12 Israeli jet fighters raided six <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region in Wednesday's attack. Five were manned by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s fighters and one by the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study Shows Poor Pay Greater Part of Income on Sales and Excise
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A four-member family earning $ 31,000 a year pays three times as much of its income in state sales and excise taxes as does one making over $ 612,000, a private study reported today. The share of earnings soaked up by those taxes is almost five times as large for the poorest families _ those making less than $ 8,600 _ as it is for the richest, according to a report by Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. This happens because the taxes are applied at a flat rate regardless of income. In 23 states, the disparity is even worse than the national average. The poor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> pay about seven times as much of their earnings in sales and excise taxes as do the rich; in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, almost six times as much. The study focused on general sales taxes and on excise taxes, chiefly those on gasoline and tobacco. It concluded that: _ The poorest 20 percent of four-member families, averaging income of $ 8,581, paid 5.4 percent of their earnings in sales and excise taxes last year _ The second one-fifth, averaging $ 20,535, paid 3.9 percent _ The third, averaging $ 31,497, paid 3.3 percent _ The fourth, averaging $ 44,910, paid 2.9 percent _ The highest-earning one-fifth, averaging $ 66,912, paid 2.5 percent _ The top-earning 5 percent, averaging $ 187,316, paid 1.6 percent _ Four-member families averaging $ 612,122 a year _ the richest 0.7 percent of Americans _ paid 1.1 percent of their incomes for sales and excise taxes Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> is a Washington-based research organization that is financed by organized labor and several liberal social groups. The organization considers income taxes more equitable than consumption taxes, including excise and sales taxes. Income taxes generally take a bigger bite of each dollar as income rises and, thus, fall more heavily on upper-income Americans. `` By relying on nickel-and-dime sales taxes, state governments across the country have quietly heaped an onerous burden on their poorest citizens,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, director of Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, said in releasing the study. `` The less you make, the worse you do _ especially in states with heavy taxes on food, utilities, tobacco and fuels.'' The ultimate solution, he said, is for states to rely less on sales taxes and more on income taxes. In the meantime, <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> added, sales taxes can be made less onerous by extending rebates to the poor and applying the levies disproportionately to services that are generally used by the well-to-do, such as club memberships and home-improvement services. The study concluded that the 10 states with relatively low tax burdens on the poor have considerably more money available for public services than do the 10 whose sales taxes on the poor are highest. `` Taxing the poor heavily is both cruel and inefficient,'' said <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>. `` It does n't produce much in the way of revenues because the poor do n't make very much money.'' Sixteen states still fully tax food; over 22 percent of all food purchases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are taxed. In fact, the study found, the 10 states with the most onerous sales taxes on the poor all tax food. They are: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The poor spend 6.2 percent of income on electrical bills, more than double the rate of the middle-income family. But that middle-income family pays three times as big a share for electricity as do the rich, the study found. The portion of the $ 600,000-a-year family's income spent for tax on take-home beer is only 15 percent of the $ 8,600 family's share. On cigarettes, the upper-income family's share is 1 percent of the low-income family's; on gasoline, 4 percent; on fresh flowers, 98 percent; on legal fees, 100 percent; jewelry, 259 percent; wine for home consumption, 324 percent, and out-of-town lodging, 613 percent. The study found that only six states have set up a system of tax credits to reduce the sales-tax burden on the poor. In only one state, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, would the credit offset as much as half the burden. The six states and the theoretical reduction for the poor, if all the poor applied for the credit: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 64 percent; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 35 percent; <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, 26 percent; <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, 22 percent; <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, 17 percent, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 7 percent.

 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> will become the next casualty of the 1988 presidential campaign if he fails to win the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses on Saturday, a campaign aide said today, as the other candidates took aim across party lines. Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> criticized Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and Democrats <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attacked <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a preview of what the fall campaign might bring. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> insisted publicly that no decisions had been made, but an aide said the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman would leave the presidential race early next week in time to file for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat by the Tuesday deadline. `` He will be out if he does n't win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is running third in the polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Although the primary season is far from over, the candidates appeared to be shifting their attention toward the general-election confrontation in November between their two parties. After <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, both parties hold primaries in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Heading into this round of contests, the Democrats have largely avoided the bitter battles among themselves that were typical of the Super Tuesday campaign earlier this month. But there's still some infighting afoot. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has sounded a drumbeat of attacks against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days, accusing him of inconsistency on trade issues. He was expected to bring up the subject again today in an economic address. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman has been courting workers, especially those in the auto industry, with his get-tough-on-foreigners trade message. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, without mentioning <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> by name, took a swipe at him for that. `` It would be easy to blame all our problems on foreigners,'' he told the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Legislature. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator is badly in need of a Northern victory, and his political director, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> may be the place for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to `` punch through.'' Also making a big push in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, whose home-state victory in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week revived his bid. `` If I can win <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, two weeks later is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. ... That would give me a lift and put me back in the ball game in a major way,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was crisscrossing <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where polls have indicated he is running second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Other candidates may have more money, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told auto workers, but he has a richer message. `` I've been ... walking the assembly line, standing with and fighting for the workers,'' he said. `` I do n't have the big engine, but I know the roads a lot better.'' That was about the closest <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came to criticizing his Democratic opponents. Instead, he took the vice president to task, vowing to `` keep on challenging him on the leadership gap.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, too, delivered a forceful attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying the vice president `` wants another chance to cut taxes for the rich.'' He also questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the Iran-Contra affair. `` It's not as if he were a neophyte sitting in the White House with no basis of judgment on the arms-for-hostages swap,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In a <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 51 percent said yes when asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was hiding something the public ought to know about the Iran-Contra affair; 28 percent said no and 21 percent said they did n't know. The margin of error was 3 points, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got kinder treatment at the hands of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, now a rival in name only. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds an overwhelming lead in delegates, and the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator has abandoned his once-bitter attacks on the vice president. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> speech on Wednesday, accused the Democratic contenders of a `` failure of nerve as well as a failure of vision'' in dealing with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator singled out <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the sharpest criticism, saying: `` He says that this country ... has no choice but to tolerate the existence of Soviet client states wherever subversion might install them.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> retorted: `` I guess <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is taking after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because he's accomplishing what <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ca n't _ beating <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls.'' A poll published Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favored by 64 percent of likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the choice of just 20 percent. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, brushed that off. `` I do n't pay any attention to polls. They said I was going to win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose father was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, further consolidated his strength in the state with the endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poliner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was raising money in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, with a new endorsement of his own to point to: the popular Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> senator, who is sometimes faulted for a less-than-dynamic speaking style, used the occasion to poke a little fun at both himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` It has been said of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that he is dull, a charge with which I am not unfamiliar,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` But governance is not an amusement park.''

 A drawbridge that got stuck in the up position, snarling traffic for 20 miles and stranding hundreds of motorists, was fixed today after blocking auto travel to most of the Keys, police said. `` The bridge just opened,'' <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> duty officer <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON> said at 8:30 a.m. Rush-hour traffic on the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> is normally heavy, she said. That, coupled with the hundreds of motorists stranded when the bridge broke down Wednesday, means traffic jams will continue for a while, she said. The 300-foot bridge is about 30 miles down the 135-mile chain of islands, and is the only road link between the southern Keys and those to the north and the mainland. `` I think every tourist in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has called us tonight,'' <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> duty officer <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said as crews worked to fix the bridge. `` Apparently the bridge was raising ... most likely for a boat. I guess it just went up too far or the wind caught it and the gears are stuck in the upright position.'' Stranded motorists were sheltered for the night in hotels and in schools. Some drivers simply left their cars in the traffic jam and walked to nearby bars or restaurants. `` We're completely swamped in here and it's wall-to-wall people outside,'' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, whose <PERSON> Erik </PERSON>'s Floating Restaurant is just south of the bridge. `` Some are impatient, but mostly they're saying ` Give me another beer.' <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> said he unfolded every lawn chair he owned and was serving in the parking lot. <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said about 25 children were spending the night at the building because a bus taking about 45 of them home was stuck on the south side of the bridge. Some students stayed at the home of friends who live on the south side, and others were fetched home by boat, she said. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Keys are linked by the Overseas Highway. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the last time he could remember a similar incident was in 1981.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> for an inquiry into alleged Honduran armed incursions into Sandinista territory, a court spokesman said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also want a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer force to monitor the border between the two countries, the spokesman said. The request, filed with the court Monday, was disclosed as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the U.S.-backed Contral rebel forces trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government agreed to a 60-day cease-fire to begin April 1. The world court, based in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, is the judicial branch of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The Nicaraguan gambit revives a case suspended in August as a result of the Central American peace plan. The plan was signed by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Tensions on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border were reportedly abating, despite a Honduran military report Wednesday that small numbers of Nicaraguan troops have entered Honduran territory in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> province. Sandinista soldiers fought Contra rebels in the region last week. The approximately 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week were to be flown back to their bases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early next week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were dispatched to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> accused the Nicaraguan army of incursions into <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> territory earlier this month. The Pentagon said at the time of the airlift that the American troops were in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on a training mission. The Sandinstas have denied crossing the Honduran border in their skirmishes with the Contras and have in turn accused Honduran troops of crossing the Nicaraguan border to support the rebels. The Nicaraguan Embassy here claimed today that `` several Contra incursions with Honduran support'' occurred in the course of March. In its request, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> asked the court to launch `` an inquiry ... investigating the recent incidents in the Bocay -LRB- border -RRB- region and the causes of such incidents.'' And it requested `` the creation of a group of observers by the appropriate organ of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to monitor incidents at the border region.'' The request is part of an ongoing case against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> brought before the court 18 months ago. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> originally sought a court ruling ordering <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to halt alleged support for the Contras. <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> has repeatedly claimed that the Contras are operating from bases inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has not denied that there are Contra bases on its territory but has said it is powerless to halt the rebel activities. No date has been set for hearings on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s request.

 Actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was both cheered and booed for her work against the Vietnam War during a hearing on whether to snub her when she visits to shoot scenes for a movie. About 250 people attended Wednesday night's public hearing at <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where the state commissioner of veterans service, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Halachis </PERSON>, called an end to the arguments over <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. `` Arguing about the appropriateness of this movie will not heal one wound ... or provide jobs for one man or woman,'' <PERSON> Halachis </PERSON> said. Applause, cheers and whistles punctuated the remarks of <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, head of veterans services for <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION>, who referred to <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s 1972 trip to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War. `` She did make the statement she was sorry -LRB- and that -RRB- people misunderstood her intentions. It was our fault we misunderstood her. What was <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s punishment? Enormous wealth! <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is not welcome in <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s planned presence this summer has stirred strong passions in the mill city of 55,112 people along the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. The movie, `` Union Street,'' is about an illiterate mill worker. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is to play a woman who teaches the man to read. Veterans from out of state have come to town to lend <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> their support, and even former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> issued a statement praising her for her anti-war activism. But several veterans' groups throughout western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have voiced their displeasure because of her trip to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. At the urging of local veterans, aldermen in nearby <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> voted 11-4 on Feb. 2 to consider <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> a `` persona non grata'' if she comes to their city to work. <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> aldermen called Wednesday's hearing on a request that they pass a resolution similar to the one in <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> aldermen, however, said they would not try to block the shooting of the movie. And the mayors of <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> have said they support the veterans' right to protest <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s visit as well as her right to set foot in their communities. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Liteky </PERSON>, a Medal of Honor recipient, came from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to speak on behalf of <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. `` I'm very grateful for those who protested against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Had they not done that, I think we would have had more people die,'' said the former chaplain, whose trip was paid by a group of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who are now peace activists. Before the hearing, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> Delfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barabani </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said a dozen veterans' groups in the city, representing hundreds of people, unanimously approved a resolution opposing <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s visit. `` She's got a right to her opinions. I've got a right to mine. This is my town. I do n't feel particularly comfortable with her coming here.''

 This impoverished <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city has no money today, and may have no choice but to seek protection in bankruptcy court, says an attorney who garnished all of the city's funds to pay part of a $ 3.4 million judgment. `` They can file a petition for bankruptcy with the federal court, and a trustee can be appointed,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, attorney for a city jail inmate who suffered permanent brain damage when he was beaten by another prisoner. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said there was about $ 800,000 in city accounts when the documents were served Wednesday. She said about $ 85,000 in payroll and vendor checks are outstanding and apparently can not be cashed. `` My real interest right now is payroll. That's critical,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frierson </PERSON>. `` It's bad that it happened, but it was a bad situation that caused the lawsuit, too.'' The city's next pay day is March 30. Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Officer </PERSON> declined comment. The judgment _ now about $ 4 million with interest _ was awarded in 1985 to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man who suffered permanent brain damage in a beating in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> jail in January 1984. <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> was arrested for driving with an open bottle of malt liquor. He was placed in a cell with a man who was being held on misdemeanor charges but had a history of violent crime. <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> said the man beat <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage and will require medical care for the rest of his life. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the city to pay the judgment, clearing the way for <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> and the <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> family to seize the city's bank accounts by filing the garnishment documents. The garnishment affected city funds held in banks, and fines and taxes collected by <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` As far as the people of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> are concerned, this is n't going to hurt the citizens any more than they already are,'' <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> said. `` They already do n't get their trash picked up. They already have a fire department and police department that is n't properly equipped `` Perhaps if they go into bankruptcy and a trustee is appointed and starts making decisions, the people of the city will even be better off,'' <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Legislators: $2.2 Billion Anti-Drug Bill Turns Up Heat in Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 2.4 billion `` self-funding'' anti-drug bill is `` the beginning of the first major assault'' on the nation's drug problem, according to one of the legislation's principal sponsors `` We have to be more forceful,'' Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said at a news conference Wednesday with more than a dozen of the bill's 35 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> co-sponsors `` We have mobilized a few assets; we have a lot more to do.'' The cost of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 would be offset by an estimated $ 3.2 billion in debt collection mandated by the bill, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said in introducing the legislation. The bill would add staff to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> to collect an additional $ 1.25 billion in taxes owed the government, and direct other federal agencies to collect $ 2 billion in non-tax debt owed to Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. The money would be placed in a new Anti-Drug Abuse Treasury Fund to help pay for the bill, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. The 199-page bill calls for resurrecting the state and local narcotics control grant program by providing $ 1.5 billion over three years, including $ 250 million next year. Additionally, the bill moves the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to provide better coordination with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and creates a streamlined deportation process for aliens who have been convicted of a drug-related or violent crime.

 A major environmental group says an unreleased report of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> shows that up to 14 percent of streams in sampled areas of eastern mountains are too acidic.

As part of its research on the effects of acid rain, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> extensively sampled lakes and streams in 1985 and 1986. Lake results have been reported extensively.

 Israeli troops shot dead an Arab today and wounded four others, including a 12-year-old, in clashes across the occupied territories, hospital officials said. Overnight, troops swept through the occupied lands in a mass arrest of Palestinians. <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawalma </PERSON>, 21, died of two bullet wounds to the chest and heart during a clash in the <LOCATION> Balatta </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said. Among the four Palestinians wounded in scattered clashes frm <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> was a 12-year-old girl from the village of <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION>, 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the officials said. Arab media reports said troops were using several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools as detention centers. The army said it was checking the reports of casualties and declined to comment on reports that schools were being used as detention centers. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> for the second straight day. There was no immediate word on casualties. It was the third Israeli strike against Palestinian bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a week and the fifth this year. Because of the ongoing violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Monsignor <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch, decided to cancel the traditional Palm Sunday procession from the Mount of Olives to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, acting in his capacity as interior minister, ordered the Haifa-based <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION>, a communist newspaper, closed until the end of the month on charges it was inciting <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unrest. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court ordered the army to return film confiscated earlier this week from Time and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> magazines and the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency but said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities had the right to process the film first. The film, taken Sunday, showed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier moments after he was shot and killed in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The soldier was the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier to be killed since the unrest in the occupied territories broke out Dec. 8. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 107 Arabs have died in the unrest, most of them killed by Israeli gunfire. `` We're not satisfied with the decision,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, a Time correspondent and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had demanded the return of the film immediately without it being processed.'' Israeli officials rounded up at least 12 Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> overnight, bringing to more than 107 the number of Arabs arrested there in the past four days, the <ORGANIZATION> Gaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said today One attorney, <PERSON> Raji </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourani </PERSON>, said the lawyers' association counts only those reported by family members and estimated the actual number of arrests in the past four days in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> at about 350. An Islamic official in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers had detained more than 150 imams, or Moslem religious leaders, in nighttime roundups this week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of those detained were members of the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad movement. The army has confirmed it is making arrests but has refused to give details. Israeli officials have said the tactic has reduced Arab violence. The patriarch decided to suspend this Sunday's procession because of the possibility of violence along its narrow, winding route through <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the Rev. <PERSON> Cladio </PERSON> <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The procession commemorates <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' entry into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> before his crucifixion. `` Prudence suggests this decision. It was a personal decision of the Patriarch and no other forces influenced him,'' <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON> denied reports that <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s first Arab patriarch for Latin-rite Catholics, had been pressured by the underground leadership of the Palestinian unrest to call off the ceremony, which has been canceled only three times since 1932. <PERSON> Baratto </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> there were fears that Christians from the occupied territories would be prevented from attending due to curfews. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> reportedly told a parliamentary committee that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has jailed 3,000 Arabs since anti-occupation violence began Dec. 8. An additional 1,000 Arabs were arrested but set free, he said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on Wednesday told officers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that large-scale rioting `` has been substantially reduced ... as a result of the general activity of the army, the security forces, the riot police. `` We feel a certain tiredness among the -LRB- Arab -RRB- population,'' he said. Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy was `` a prolonged combined action accompanied with patience and built on three elements: the military force, local punishments and economic pressure.''

<TEXT>
 Pro-government newspapers today announced the 60-day cease-fire between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels with banner headlines but said the accord was only a beginning in efforts to end six years of war. The government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels on Wednesday night agreed to the cease-fire to negotiate an end to their war and signed a nine-point accord that promises the rebels a role in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s political process `` Cease-Fire! Peace Explodes?'' read the eight-column headline in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diario </LOCATION>. Barricada, the official paper of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The First Step Toward Peace.'' The agreement was the first concrete step toward ending the conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> in broadcasting the cease-fire softened its tones and referred to the rebels as `` the Contras,'' instead of `` the mercenaries.'' <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, in an editorial, offered a sombering note. `` Is the mercenary directorate really disposed to fulfill the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreements?'' the editorial said. `` And if they are, are they capable of maintaing their positions while facing a negative reaction from the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' The cease-fire is to begin April 1, with negotiators meeting again April 6 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to work out a permanent truce. In the interim, a truce that took effect Monday is to remain in force. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> unexpectedly traveled to this small village on the Costa Rican border for the signing, which followed three days of talks. He called the plan `` a great challenge for all Nicaraguans'' and called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to support this effort and get ready to normalize its relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' `` I think, I hope and I believe that we have made a start, a firm start to end this war that is killing ... sons of the same country, sons of the same mothers,'' said Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, another leader of the U.S.-supported rebels, said the nine points in the agreement `` are not solely an opportunity to achieve peace and agreement, but the only opportunity.'' The agreement was made `` among Nicaraguans, full of good will and confidence in the future,'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, who was among Contra and Sandinista leaders crowded on a makeshift dais. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had any immediate comment on the agreement, which calls for the estimated 10,000 rebels to move into specified zones in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during the first 15 days of April. Delegations from both sides will return to <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on Monday to determine the zones. The Contras also agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization. This would rule out further military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has tried in vain to secure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid ended Feb. 29 and a successful Sandinista military offensive ensued. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will on Sunday release 100 Contra prisoners and free half the remaining 1,400 such prisoners when <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> fighters have moved into the designated zones. The remaining 700 Contra prisoners will be freed when a permanent truce is in place. The 1,800 former National Guardsmen in prison since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> overthrew the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979 will be released after a final truce is worked out. Under <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, the army was called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement says the Sandinista government will guarantee freedom of expression without restrictions, in accordance with a regional peace plan signed last August by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of four other Central American countries. Many press liberties were barred in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for almost six years under a state-of-emergency decree that has since been lifted. The agreement says the Sandinista government will grant gradual amnesty and allow all political exiles to return to the country without fear of persecution and be able to participate in the political process. The government also agreed to discuss the issue of military service in a national dialogue with the internal political opposition. The Contras had sought a suspension of conscription. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, opposition leaders hailed the agreement. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It is a positive effort. Hopefully, it will contribute to ending the war and to the rise of the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tablada </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called the move `` a historic step ... a serious and responsible compromise.'' The agreement was signed by Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister and head of the Sandinista delegation, and <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. Also signing were <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, and Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The secretary-general and cardinal attended the talks as witnesses. The meeting at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> was the first time the Sandinistas and Contras had met on Nicaraguan soil.

<HEAD>Attempt To Give Sight To Girl Born Without Visible Eyes Fails</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Optic surgeons built eye sockets and an eyelid for a 7-year-old girl born with her eyes completely covered by skin, but they say they have failed in a long-shot attempt to give her sight. `` The surgery was unsuccessful,'' Dr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON>, an ophthalmologist who operated on <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdogan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, said late Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Surgeons hoped to implant a cornea in the little girl's right eye Wednesday, but after three incisions guided by an ultrasonic scan they found no iris or pupil, <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> said. The eye appeared to be all sclera, or white. <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON>'s left eye is so deformed it is beyond sight, he said. <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> said doctors might make one more attempt to find the right part of the eye using magnetic resonance imaging but that it is highly unlikely the girl will ever see even partially. `` We are a long, long way from the needed technology,'' said a corneal transplant specialist, Dr. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON>. `` I do n't think I'll see it in my lifetime. The man who brought <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> to this country for surgery two years ago, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> restaurateur <PERSON> Ismet </PERSON> <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON>, said he accepted <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON>'s verdict but could n't stop hoping. `` The hope has to be there,'' <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON> said. `` It's part of humanity, you know.'' <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> suffers from a rare condition callyed cryptophthalmos, or hidden eye, in which the eyes are below the skin, <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> said. She has a nose and a mouth `` and that's it for her face,'' he said. <PERSON> Cryptopthalmos </PERSON> in both eyes is so rare that there are only three or four accounts of it in medical literature, <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> said. Removal of the skin that had covered the girl's eyes revealed that the retina of her right eye could detect light, he said. But even if Wednesday's implant had succeeded, he said, she would have been able to make out only vague forms. <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> had built sockets for both eyes and used tissue from the girl's mouth to construct a right eyelid. He is repeating the procedure for the left eye. <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> said cosmetic surgery probably will continue to make <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON>'s face appear more normal and that an artificial eye will be inserted in her right eye socket in the next three or four weeks.

 She's $ 90,000 short of her fund-raising goal, but <PERSON> Mellissa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was ready to descend from a record 516 days atop two telephone poles having gained a fiance and the pride of her pole-sitting mom. `` I'm going to miss the birds on my balcony and the crazy drivers going by down below,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who late this afternoon planned to climb down from the 43-foot-high shack she called home for more than 1 -LCB- years. Miss Sanders, interviewed today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' joked that the first thing she wants to do when she climbs down is `` kiss the ground, and never leave it again. No, I do n't really know.'' On Feb. 25, the 19-year-old woman who had hoped to raise $ 100,000 for cancer research broke the 488-day mark for pole-sitting set by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. During that time, in which she endured two winters and many meals of pizza and submarine sandwiches, she raised $ 6,000. She said she stayed another month to raise more money, and reported $ 4,000 more in donations. Even though <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was far from the monetary goal, her mother, <PERSON> Mauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, said was still `` proud enough to burst.'' `` I feel like we both did it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who broke a smiliar pole-sitting record in 211 days in 1959. Her daughter's fiance, 25-year-old <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was on hand Wednesday to help her prepare for her descent. They met after Seal read an article about Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and telephoned her. They announced their engagement in August, before meeting. `` We've been engaged and we have n't even gone on a date yet,'' Seal said. But Seal has been to the poletop abode. The first time, `` it was scary coming up here. I hate heights. But once I was up here, everything turned out fine. She's turned out better than I expected,'' <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` Everything happened right. Nothing was forced or pushed or anything. It just fell into place.'' He said a wedding date of Nov. 5, 1989 _ the anniversary of the day they met _ had been discussed. `` He's great. He's been just great,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Her 6-by-7-by-9-foot shack was equipped with a plastic kiddie pool, television and a telephone that prompted regular $ 300 phone bills. For company she had her cat, Pole Cat. She even refused to come down last February, when 70 mph winds buffeted her during a major snowstorm. `` I've had mirror after mirror up here, and every one has broken almost immediately,'' she said. `` Maybe that's why I've had bad luck'' in fund-raising. Another bit of bad luck, her mother says, was in dealing with the man who initially sponsored the pole-sit, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, as a way to advertise his restaurant, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>, and raise money for a charitable cause. Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said she moved from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to do the stunt when she heard from a relative that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was looking for a pole-sitter. Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, had cancer, but her disease has been in remission four years. However, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> opted out of the project less than six months after it was started, contending the <ORGANIZATION> Sanderses </ORGANIZATION> expected too much financial support and were claiming too large a percentage of the charitable proceeds. `` I'm glad she made it ... but she wanted to change the rules once she got up in the house,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who plans to turn $ 3,300 in donations over to <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> cancer research this week. Mrs. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> replied angrily, saying, `` We've done nothing wrong. It's just that he pulled out on Mellissa.'' Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said she plans to move back to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in May and attend a trade school. `` I'll miss being able to just do what I want and talk on the phone all night. I'm going to get back to nine to five,'' she said. `` I'm looking forward to walking around and spending time with family and friends and being able to drive my car.'' The last thing she will miss is taking a bath atop in the inflatable tub. `` I have water, but washing my hair was really difficult,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> visited two schools here but said he saw nothing to change his assessment of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s system as the nation's worst, based on student achievement on standardized tests. `` Of course, there are successes here. Of course, there are positive things going on that deserve recognition,'' he said Wednesday. `` But things are going to have to improve. We're going to need more than a few success stories.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> visited an all-black elementary school in a crime-ridden neighborhood and an integrated high school at the invitation of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Last fall, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s public schools were suffering an `` educational meltdown,'' and Mrs. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> hoped to change his views with a look at what she called daily educational successes. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s first stop was <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where all the students in the upper grades are reading below their grade level, though scores have improved in the last year. The school serves the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Homes </PERSON>, a decaying public-housing project. At <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bogan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in a predominantly white neighborhood, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> visited a computer lab and an advanced algebra class where he saw a teacher he later described as excellent. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he saw superb teachers at both schools and thought both had good principals. `` But two schools do not a system make. The facts remain the facts,'' he said. Earlier, he had cited problems with the nation's third-largest school system that include a dropout rate approaching 50 percent and low standardized test scores. Half of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s high schools ranked in the bottom 1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools for scores on the American College Test. Mrs. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, sitting beside <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> at a news conference after the tour, said a recent survey showed <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> students ranked 20th out of 41 large urban school systems in scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. She said a survey of 21 large urban school systems found that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ranked 16th for student performance on the ACT.

<HEAD>Personal Incomes Rose 0.9 Percent in February</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes rose a healthy 0.9 percent in February, the best showing in four months, while consumer spending climbed at the most rapid pace since December, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said consumer spending, powered by a pickup in auto sales, advance 0.7 percent in February, a marked improvement from the 0.1 percent January increase. The rise in personal incomes followed a modest 0.3 percent January increase and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent increase in October. With incomes rising faster than spending, Americans' savings rate climbed as well, rising to 5.2 percent of after-tax income last month, the highest level since October. The big gain in incomes reflected in part healthy increases in employment which occurred during February. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.7 percent last month, an 8 -LCB- - year low Analysts said the new figures showed that the collapse of stock prices last October has had little impact on consumer spending decisions and provided fresh evidence that the economy should continue expanding this year with no threat of a recession. The 0.7 percent increase in personal consumption spending, the biggest advance since a 0.8 percent rise in December, which includes virtually everything except nterest payments on debt, reflected a big increase of $ 7.4 billion in sales of durable goods, a category which had declined $ 2.4 billion in January. The report said this swing came from a rebound in auto sales. Purchases of non-durable goods, items not expected to last at least three years, rose $ 2 billion in February after having fallen $ 7.7 billion in January. Purchases of services, which include housing costs, increased $ 12.4 billion following a $ 13.7 billion rise in January. Wages and salaries, the most important segment of the income category, rose $ 15.4 billion in February after a $ 13.3 billion January increase. Farm incomes increased $ 8.5 billion in February after a decline of $ 8.2 billion in Janaury. The big February gain and the large January decline were both attributed to swings in government subsidy payments to farmers. Disposable income, the amount left over after taxes are paid, climbed 1.1 percent in February, almost double the 0.6 percent January increase. It was the best showing since a 2.1 percent rise in October and was credited in part to individual tax cuts taking effect as part of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul legislation.

 The golden arches spanned the communist world for the first time as <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> opened a fast-food restaurant today in the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> capital. `` This is just like home,'' said <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, an American living in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> who was among the first customers on opening day. `` I ca n't believe American hamburgers are finally here.'' Police were called in to keep order as hundreds of customers waited in lines around the block at <LOCATION> Slavija </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>'s main downtown squares. `` Both the hamburger and the restaurant are fantastic, and I think Yugoslavs will like them,'' said the 16-year-old <PERSON> Dragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> after eating his first Big Mac. Five of his teen-age friends nodded in agreement. There are nearly 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in the world, but the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> outlet is the first in a communist country. The American corporation plans to open five more restaurants in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in the next five years. The new restaurant features a plush interior which can seat 350 visitors and serve up to 2,500 meals an hour, operators said. It is set in a neatly decorated, old building that has been extensively renovated with an interior of amber-colored marble floors and tables, soft illumination, pastel-colored upholstery, and modern art paintings. A Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> and french fries, costs the equivalent of $ 2.57, competitive with similar foods in the city's other restaurants. The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> media has said the success of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> depends on its acceptance by people long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast food dish called the Pljeskavica. The traditional dish is made with ground pork and onions instead of the beef used in Big Macs and other American hamburgers. It is also served in a bun and sold throughout the country in fast-food outlets and other restaurants. `` In fact, this is a clash between the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pljeskavica </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Vesna </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, an official of <ORGANIZATION> Genex </ORGANIZATION>, a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that contracted the joint venture agreement with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. They'll share profits equally, but the restaurant will be managed and run entirely by 110 Yugoslavs. McDonald's will also bump heads with other <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> customs, such as the time-honored <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> tradition of lingering after meals. In the first few months of its operation, specially-trained personnel will issue warnings to loiterers, said <PERSON> Predrag </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostanic </PERSON>, managing director of the facility. The next Eastern European McDonald's is scheduled to open in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, next month, according to McDonald's officials.

 An exiled Soviet artist who painted a picture of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> partly as an expression of his love of American life has incurred the wrath of the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Artist <PERSON> Mihail </PERSON> <PERSON> Chemiakin </PERSON> said he wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> inviting him and other company officials to see the painting `` Sorokin Soup,'' then on display at the <LOCATION> Bowles-Sorokko </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. He even suggested Disney might want to buy it. Instead, he said Wednesday, he was answered with a March 11 legal response saying not only would Disney not accept his invitation to look or buy, the company objected to the gallery display and to any attempts to sell the painting because the face of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> belongs to Disney alone. `` It is sad and ironic that an artist who was forced out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of political censorship for his artwork would come into the West ... and be hit by censorship here,'' gallery co-owner <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorokko </PERSON> said Wednesday. The painting since has been taken down, said <PERSON> Sorokko </PERSON>, who called from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he co-owns another gallery. <PERSON> Sorokko </PERSON> said the New York-based artist chose the image of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> more as a tribute to the late artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, who reveled in pop icons, and certainly not to rip off the good Disney name. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> is a symbol of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... Their approach is just totally ludicrous,'' he said. <PERSON> Chemiakin </PERSON>, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978, is known for creating a painting style called `` metaphysical synthesis,'' which combines images from various cultures and times, <PERSON> Sorokko </PERSON> said. He was exiled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1971, according to information released by his publicist here. He had been accepted at the Soviet's <ORGANIZATION> Repin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> at age 14, but was thrown out two years later for failing to conform to the traditional `` Socialist Realism'' style of painting. Recently though, <PERSON> Chemiakin </PERSON> has been invited back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to display his work, <PERSON> Sorokko </PERSON> said.

 About 400 people decrying what they called a lack of government concern about AIDS demonstrated today in the city's financial district, and 105 protesters were arrested when they blocked the streets. `` We're protesting the same thing we've been protesting for the past year, lack of government oversight of the whole AIDS predicament, the whole AIDS crisis,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, a founder of ACT UP _ the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' bold step in banning smoking on most of its flights is not expected to be followed soon by other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, industry analysts say. Northwest, the nation's fifth-largest airline, announced Wednesday it will prohibit smoking on all its domestic flights except those to and from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and on some foreign routes. The ban makes <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, Minn.-based Northwest the first major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline to mandate a smoke-free environment, surpassing federal regulations that on April 23 outlaw smoking on all domestic flights less than two hours. `` It does run the risk of some loss of business,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cammisa </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based newsletter. `` I guess they -LRB- Northwest officials -RRB- really stuck their neck out.'' Wall Street seemed unimpressed by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s move. The airline's stock closed on Wall Street at $ 45.75 a share, down 12 -LCB- cents from Tuesday. Several smokers waiting to depart on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flights Wednesday from Minneapolis-St. <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> said they do n't object to the smoking `` It's probably a good idea,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> real estate broker. `` I can get by without smoking.'' Some Northwest flight attendants who are smokers said the new policy might help them quit smoking, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The new policy, `` Northwest Clears the Air,'' takes effect April 23 with the new federal regulations. It applies to flights within the contiguous 48 states and to and from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The longest flights covered by the smoking ban are four or five hours, the airline said. About 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic flights and about 20 percent of all domestic flights last more than the two-hour federal duration. Northwest flights to and from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and overseas will offer smoking sections because those flights `` carry a greater proportion of foreign passengers who feel differently about the issue,'' the airline said. A.B. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing chief, said the ban accedes to passenger and employee requests. The policy is not risk-free, he said, but `` we believe more nonsmokers will switch to Northwest than smokers will leave.'' That was n't the case for <ORGANIZATION> Muse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a regional carrier that failed to establish itself as the only non-smoking airline in 1985. Its research showed the policy diverted as many as 35 percent of potential fliers. Surveys showed customers find `` price, convenience and service more important than non-smoking'' in an airline, <PERSON> Muse </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said at the time. The policy ended when <PERSON> Muse </PERSON> was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. No 2 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is watching <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s lead but, `` We have no plans to follow that move,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. Its surveys indicate a significant number of people want to smoke on planes. American and other big airlines contacted Wednesday said their no-smoking policies would meet the new federal law, which mandates civil fines of as much as $ 1,000 for smoking, $ 2,000 for tampering with lavatory smoke alarms. `` We are ready to implement our no-smoking policy ... in line with the federal law,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline. Airline analyst <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not expect other carriers to match Northwest's policy. `` It's a gutsy move and most airlines do n't make gutsy moves,'' he said. `` It could alienate some people.'' The alienated include <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, which on April 22 offers smoking flights and the same fares as <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to such cities as <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Using leased planes from Las Vegas-based <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the club hopes to serve 63 cities from five hubs with 60 planes in two years, said club president <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>. `` When the smoking ban begins, we want to offer smokers an alternative _ and, hopefully, make some money,'' he said. Non-smokers will be allowed on board, but they will have to be `` tolerant,'' the club says.

<TEXT>
 The new president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> says he intends to continue working within the Southern Baptist Convention, though he says his group is taking on the appearance of a separate denomination. The alliance represents a moderate group within the 14.7 million-member convention, which is dominated by fundamentalists. `` We are not a fringe group, we are not an avant garde faction of the Southern Baptist Convention,'' the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` The great majority of <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> members are denominational loyalists.'' <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said, however, that the alliance may appear to be headed toward denominational status because of its publishing activities and its discussions concerning the possible need for a new seminary or divinity school. `` Whenever we take specific steps like that, we are acting independently of the institutions of the Southern Baptist Convention and that gives the appearance of independence, but it is not our desire to forge a permanent split with the <ORGANIZATION> SBC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, he said, the alliance has to be an `` advocate for groups and causes we feel are disenfranchised. ... If this means acting independently of the existing agencies and channels of <ORGANIZATION> SBC </ORGANIZATION> life, then for the time being, we are willing to do that.'' <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> is pastor of the 561-member <ORGANIZATION> Northminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, the third church to join the alliance after its formation in February 1987. The alliance has grown from 22 founders to more than 25,000 members, including 40 churches in 11 states and more than 2,000 individual members. The fundamentalists have gained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy by electing their presidential candidates for the past nine years. The president has broad appointive powers, naming hundreds of people annually to various Baptist institutions, including the boards of the six seminaries and the five major operating agencies of the denomination. While both groups generally are conservative, they disagree on key issues, including biblical inerrancy and ordination of women. Fundamentalists, who oppose ordination of women, say the Bible is without factual error, not only in matters of faith but also in science and history. Moderates maintain there is room for interpretation, especially in non-religious areas.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to grant federal matching funds to the presidential campaign of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who is standing trial on a charge relating to alleged irregularity in his 1984 campaign. The commission on a 5-1 vote said that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has fulfilled the requirements for eligibility to receive matching funds. Commissioner <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikens </PERSON>, voting against the majority, said that an <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> survey of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> contributors raised `` a question of patent irregularity'' in fund raising. But Commissioner <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said there was not enough evidence to deny certification, and he added, `` Presidential candidates and campaigns can come in many different shapes and colors.'' A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s audit staff found that several people whose checks ended up in <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential coffers did not intend to contribute to his campaign. That was the response of 6 percent of the 713 LaRouche contributors who answered the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s survey. In describing the responses, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> audit staff wrote in a report: `` Many of the responses included unsolicited written comments wherein the individuals described instances where he @ she 1. felt pressured into making a contribution, 2. made contributions believing that the contribution was for a specific purpose other than furthering <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s presidential nomination campaign, 3. made loans to the campaign, and 4. had contributed to a number of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s interests, while making all checks payable The audit staff recommended the commission find that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is not eligible for matching funds. But the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s legal staff came up with the opposite recommendation, stating that the `` patent irregularities indicated by the survey results do not justify an unfavorable eligibility report.'' The commission was expected to make its decision at a meeting early today. <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> legal counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>'s written opinion said some of the responding contributors seemed confused, or contributed to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> thinking he was a Republican or independent candidate instead of a Democrat, which he is. Those responses should not have been considered negative, <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said, because the donors did apparently intend to give money to a presidential campaign. The auditors contacted 1,062 of those contributors, after finding that some of the checks he submitted with his application for federal matching funds were made out simply to the initials `` L.D.C.'' In some cases, those initials were written over the initials `` SDI.'' And some checks contained memo notations regarding AIDS or SDI _ which generally refers to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative _ indicating the donors may not have intended to give money to a presidential campaign, but to one of those causes. Some contributors contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said they were under the impression they were contributing to an anti-AIDS campaign when they gave checks to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> solicitors. `` While the survey results raise serious questions regarding whether contributions submitted by the <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> campaign were made with the requisite donative intent, they do not show a clear pattern of fraud or patent irregularities,'' <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> wrote. He also said the percent of negative responses _ 39 out of 713 _ was `` arguably small.'' Nonetheless, the counsel recommended that the commission take special precautions in approving <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s submissions for matching funds. Instead of the usual five-day approval period, a review period of 25 days should be allowed for the LaRouche submissions to give the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> staff time to check for irregularities in the checks before giving him any money, the counsel recommended. The recommendation also suggests that any checks written out simply to <ORGANIZATION> LDC </ORGANIZATION>, or those with memo notations `` indicating lack of donative intent'' should be automatically declared unmatchable. To be certified for matching funds, a candidate must raise $ 100,000 across 20 states in individual contributions of $ 250 or less. After becoming eligible, the candidates can receive matching funds for each contribution of $ 250 or less that they raise privately. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, charged with conspiracy to obstruct a grand jury investigation into alleged credit card fraud and other irregularities in his 1984 campaign.

<HEAD>Calls For End To State Interference In Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s ruling body today called for the first time for a `` radical'' reduction of state interference in the economy as a way to solve the nation's worst economic and political crisis in history. The lengthy statement from the Presidency also urged new regulations on joint ventures with foreign partners, more private business in the nation's economy and changes in the tax policy which would stimulate economic growth. The unusual statement, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency, marked the first time <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s ruling body had called for changes in the running of the economy of this nonaligned communist nation. The statement appeared designed to give guidance to the government for tackling the economic and political problems expected to arise when a wage and price freeze imposed last November expires in May. There have been increasing calls for the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to relinquish control of the economy. With the current annual inflation rate of around 170 percent and a foreign debt exceeding $ 20 billion, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is faced with its worst economic and political crisis in history. The Presidency demanded that `` a program of measures and activities'' be made by the federal government to strengthen market forces and called for `` radical reduction of state regulations ... in order to overcome the dominating role of the politics over the economy.'' The statement said the implementation of this program is of `` prime interest'' and should be monitored by the presidencies of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces. Critics of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s unique system of self-management, whereby factories, farms and offices are nominally run by the workers, say the system is hampered by interference from the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The government last year imposed a series of price and wage freezes in an attempt to control inflation and stabilize sinking living standards. However, 1987 saw a record 1,500 strikes as workers protested low wages. The government of Yugoslav premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> has recently faced sharp criticism even in the state-run press for its economic policies. There have been repeated calls for the premier and his cabinet to step down _ something that has never happened in communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The statement by the Presidency said such calls `` represent an unacceptable political campaign'' that hurts the government's domestic and foreign activities The Presidency demanded, without specifying, an `` urgent'' passing of new joint venture laws. According to current law provisions, foreign companies can own no more than 51 percent shares in their joint ventures with Yugoslav enterprises and have no right to manage the companies. The current law attracted little investment by foreign partners since the unstable economic situation in this <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> country frightens off possible investors. According to a draft of a new joint venture law, which has been waiting for a long time to be passed by the parliament, foreign partners may be allowed to hold up to 99.9 percent of shares in joint ventures and the right to manage such companies. The ruling body also called for `` substantial'' reduction of administrative curbs on private business and changes in the income tax policy.

 A blaze erupted today in the engine room of a British ferry shortly after it left the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> with 348 people aboard, but tugs towed the ship to port and no one was injured. P and O, owners of the 18,000-ton Nordic, said the two-hour fire wrecked the ferry's power system. Coast guards called a major alert after the Nordic, on a six-hour English Channel crossing from <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> to the English port of <LOCATION> Felixstowe </LOCATION>, reported fire aboard 30 minutes before it had been due to dock. The Nordic, surrounded by a flotilla of tugs and life boats, was stranded for several hours five miles off the coast before tugs got the vessel under tow and brought it to <LOCATION> Felixstowe </LOCATION>, in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` Three life boats were dispatched and a helicopter was put on standby,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the nearby port of <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>. A P and O spokesman said the fire was put out by automatic firefighting equipment and the crew. The fire was confined to the engine room. `` Everyone on board was very calm and there was no danger to anyone,'' said P and O spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamming </PERSON>. Last March, another P and O ferry, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, capsized after leaving <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>, killing 193 people.

 A man being sought today for questioning in his 5-year-old daughter's death was previously accused of abusing the girl but the charge was dropped for lack of evidence, court records show. Police want to question <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiab </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, 38, a substitute teacher, about the death of <PERSON> Julianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, whose decomposed body was found in his deserted apartment. An autopsy conducted Wednesday showed evidence of trauma but a ruling on the cause of death was awaiting further tests, said Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>. Based on preliminary findings, however, `` this case is being handled as a homicide,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. In January 1986, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> had been charged with one count of felony child abuse and one count of assault after the child was hospitalized. The charge was dismissed later in the year. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> obtained cstody of the girl after his ex-wife, <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, died in 1983. The couple had been married briefly in 1981, separating after three weeks. Last fall, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> won a custody dispute involving the child's grandmother, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> In awarding custody, Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> expressed concern about reports in court files and ordered that no corporal punishment was to be used on the child. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> continued to seek custody of the child, said her attorney, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> `` She's absolutely devastated,'' <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> said. `` I'm pretty devastated too.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired eight missiles into each others' capitals today, and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claimed new victories in heavy fighting in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired six long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> at a rate of one a minute in retaliation for Iranian artillery bombardment of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it was destroying <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> `` piece by piece.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported at least 10 civilians dead and 100 wounded after the missiles hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals as well as shops and houses. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in reprisal. There was no immediate confirmation of those missile strikes from the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today, a ship put out a distress signal and appeared to be the victim of an Iranian attack, maritime salvage executives said. The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Friendship reported its engine room was on fire. If it was the victim of Iranian attack, it would be <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 10th attack on neutral shipping in the gulf since last Friday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also claimed its troops routed two Iraqi commando brigades and four armored battalions early today and advanced to within five miles of the mountain town of <LOCATION> Sayyid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sadiq </LOCATION>. The reports came in the latest phase of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 9-day-old offensive into northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today's ground assault retaliated for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> chemical bomb attacks last week that killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds whose hometowns were overrun by Iranian troops fighting with the autonomy-seeking Kurds. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s news agency said the Iranians repulsed a counterattack by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqis, capturing 400 and knocking out 30 tanks and armored vehicles. But the official Iraqi news agency, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said `` thousands of Iranians were killed'' in artillery barrages and air strikes. `` The charlatan regime in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is reaping today the harvest of its crimes,'' said an Iraqi military communique broadcast by the agency. Iranian jets flew 14 ground attack missions against Iraqi forces in the battle zone and shot down an Iraqi warplane, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s news agency said. It said ground fire downed an Iraqi helicopter gunship, but <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> denied losing any aircraft. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it has fired 42 <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since March 15 in what is known as the `` war of the cities.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has retaliated by lobbing 14 missiles into the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, which has a population of 5 million. Scores of other cities on both sides have been hit with missiles, air raids and shellfire, with hundreds of civilians killed or wounded on both sides. The Iranian news agency said the latest phase of the offensive, the heaviest fighting in the northern part of the 730-mile front, was launched in retaliatiation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> chemical bomb attacks on <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khormal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dojaila </PERSON>, three of the Kurdish towns captured last week. The Iranians claimed the poison gas attacks killed 5,000 Kurdish civilians and injured 5,000. Western reporters flown to <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> by the Iranians this week reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians there with no obvious wounds. The correspondents reported that many people had died of asphyxiation in their homes. Survivors were seen suffering from burns consistent with poison gas. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charled </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> charged in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used chemical weapons, banned under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, and urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to mount an international protest. Declaring the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> action `` a particularly grave violation'' of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said there was evidence the Iraqis had also fired chemical shells into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court today convicted former nuclear technician <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> of treason and espionage for telling a British newspaper his country possessed nuclear weapons. He could receive a life prison term. The verdict, read behind closed doors in a courtroom with boarded-up windows, climaxed the saga of the 34-year-old Israeli who said he revealed his country's nuclear secrets for the good of mankind. `` <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> is not desperate. He still wants to fight,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Avigdor </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> as he emerged from the five-minute session. He said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> sat silently as the verdict was announced, showing little emotion. `` I guess it was kind of inevitable,'' said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, who was not permitted into the secret proceedings. `` But I'm surprised they convicted him for treason.'' <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was hustled into the courtroom more than an hour before the session, amid the same tight security that accompanied the trial since it began in September. The three-judge panel had refused an open trial, saying it would harm state security. Prosecutor <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasson </PERSON> said he would ask the court for a life term, which in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is limited to 20 years. Sentencing is scheduled Sunday. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said he would appeal the verdict to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, a former technician at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear facility in <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION> and a Jewish-born convert to <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION>, was charged with treason and espionage for describing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear capacity in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. Based on <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s information, the newspaper concluded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had stockpiled the world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has never responded directly to allegations of its nuclear capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> has insisted he made his revelations to alert the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons. The state argued he intended to harm <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said earlier he thought <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> had been given a fair hearing, but complained about `` an atmosphere of guilt, with all the attention and the crazy precautions taken around him.'' Each day of the trial, <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was taken to the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> district courthouse from his jail in central <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a white van with painted-over windows. His head was often covered with a motorcycle helmet to prevent contact with waiting reporters, and police cars blared sirens as he was hustled indoors. In prison, <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> has been held in near isolation, permitted to see only his attorney and relatives. At one point, he went on a hunger strike to demand the right to see his American girlfriend, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s mysterious saga began in 1985 when he was fired from the Dimona nuclear center in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where he worked for nine years. He went to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where he became acquainted with a priest and converted to Christianity. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> later traveled to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but disappeared in October 1986, just days before <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published his revelations. Israeli officials acknowledged several weeks later he was in custody in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Details of <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s dramatic journey back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were revealed by his brother, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was lured from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman named <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, who promised him sex. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, he was abducted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents and spirited home, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said. At a pre-trial court appearance, <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> managed to flash reporters a message scribbled on his hand which told of the alleged abduction. The incident led to increased security precautions. During the trial, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> presented witnesses who said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> had not harmed state security because the information he revealed was already available in the academic world. Other defense witnesses testified <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s revelations actually bolstered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security because they created the impression among the country's <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> enemies that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was a nuclear power, providing a deterrent effect. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> argued alternatively that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had nuclear weapons, it was acting outside international supervision, a position that was morally and legally unsound. In a surprise move, he also subpoenaed Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and senior legislator <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> in an effort to show <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders kept the decision to build nuclear weapons from the parliament and the people, thereby violating <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law

 The lawyer for a man charged with sexually assaulting his daughter says the allegations are more of the same from the man's ex-wife, who last year went to jail rather than let him visit their children. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION> pleaded innocent Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Rockingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to the charge of felonious sexual assault. Bail was set at $ 5,000 personal recognizance on the condition that <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> have no contact with the daughter, now 5, or her 3 -LCB- - year-old brother Murabito since March 1987 has had unsupervised visits with the children, after a judge found no evidence to back <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>'s claims that <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> sexually abused their daughter A grand jury last week indicted Murabito based on events since the judge's decision, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said. After Wednesday's arraignment, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the charge `` is simply an extension of the divorce proceedings ... the same type of thing that the court has already ruled on in hearings last year. `` I am fairly convinced by the evidence, or I would n't have gone to the grand jury, that these children are being sexually abused,'' <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said, adding that he has an `` obligation, in my job and my conscience, to alleviate that situation.'' <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> blamed the media for ruining any chance he would have had to negotiate an out-of-court agreement with <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> that would result in `` long-term meaningful protection of the children without public fanfare or trial.'' In March 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> ruled after a seven-day civil hearing that Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> and the experts she marshaled had not proved <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> sexually abused the girl. In a 19-page divorce decree, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> admonished both parents to stop `` tearing -LRB- the children -RRB- to pieces'' and gave <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> unsupervised visits, alternating weekends and holidays, as well as two weeks each summer. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> did not return a telephone call seeking comment on Wednesday. A month before the divorce hearing, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had jailed Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> for a week _ and gave <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> temporary custody _ when she refused to obey a court order to let her husband see the children during supervised visits. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> released her after she agreed.

He was to have a second operation for a similar but smaller aneurysm on the other side of his head but instead returned to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> on March 13 and doctors discovered a blood clot in his lung. The clot itself was absorbed into the body without any damage, a hospital spokesman said, but to prevent any further problems a team of doctors last Friday inserted a tiny filter in a major vein. The small device was implanted in the vena cava, an area just below the breast bone. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said doctors will allow him to work two to four hours a day at home in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and that he should walk as exercise.

 A judge has blocked the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> from holding a rally in a predominantly black neighborhood, citing zoning laws that prohibit public gatherings without special permission. `` We consider -LRB- the Klan -RRB- similar to clubs and other organizations such as churches or synagogues'' which can not hold public gatherings in residential areas without special permits, said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> on Wednesday enjoined the Klan from holding a rally and cross-burning Friday in the yard of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, grand dragon of the Christian Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>.

 Twenty-eight current and former health inspectors were named in complaints today accusing them of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from restaurants to ignore sanitary code violations, authorities say. The charges in the federal complaint involve at least one-third of the city <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspection force of 70 and 300 restaurants in all five boroughs, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> said in a news release. The arrests this morning culminated a three-year undercover investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. This week agents confronted a number of suspects to get them to wear microphones to gather evidence against the leaders of the bribery ring. A report today in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said the operation was code-named alternatively `` Operation Kitchen'' and `` Operation Fork-It-Over.'' The restaurants paid the bribes to avoid citations for violations either real or invented, authorities said. The names of the restaurants were not made public, but they ranged from fast food restaurants to famous eateries, they said. The investigation also found that on-site inspectors split their take with supervisors, who allegedly would punish inspectors who were reluctant to share the extortion money with them, authorities said. In one incident, inspectors demanded $ 1,400 from a restaurant owner so his restaurant would not be closed for serious health violations, according to the news release. In another, inspectors charged a restaurant $ 1,200 to allow it to reopen despite serious violations. Payoffs reached hundreds of thousands of dollars altogether. The News said the restaurant owners are considered extortion victims and are not being charged. Inspectors and supervisors are paid $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 annually by the city. More than 15,000 food establishments are inspected each year for compliance with health and cleanliness standards.

 Four military leaders imprisoned for an alleged coup attempt against <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in 1971 have been released, a government spokesman said today. All four were top assistants to Defense Minister <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Piao </PERSON> during the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, and all were convicted of aiding him in an aborted attempt to murder <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and seize power. The releases leave only the `` Gang of Four'' still in prison from among the 10 fallen Cultural Revolution power brokers convicted in 1981 after a lengthy show trial. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> was <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s designated successor, a key creator of the <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> cult and author of the `` Little Red Book'' of quotations from <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. He allegedly died in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> while fleeing arrest. <PERSON> Zeng </PERSON> <PERSON> Tao </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, disclosed the releases at a news conference.

He did not explain why as recently as January, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> insisted that all four former military leaders remained in prison. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s terms end this year, while <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s ends in 1989. <PERSON> Zeng </PERSON> said two of the <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> members _ <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s widow <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON> and former Vice Premier <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chunqiao </PERSON> _ were being treated in prison for unspecified `` geriatric diseases.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON> is 74 and <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> is 70. The Gang of Four, which also included former Politburo members <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hongwen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenyuan </PERSON>, was accused of ordering illegal arrests during the decade-long Cultural Revolution and trying to seize total power after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s death in 1976.

<TEXT>
 Landmark AIDS legislation described by sponsors as a model for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has gone into effect in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, aimed at protecting the disease's victims and stopping its spread. The measure, funded by an appropriation of more than $ 5 million, will tackle the killer disease through education, testing, counseling, civil rights protection, and prosecution of people who intentionally spread acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> signed the bill Wednesday and it took effect immediately. `` We must recognize that AIDS is only beginning to take its toll on human life and in costs to our society. By acting now, especially with a strong public education program, we hope to save many of our citizens' lives,'' the governor said. Key provisions of the measure are: _ A 10-year prison sentence for intentionally spreading the AIDS virus _ Mandatory AIDS education in grades 5 through 12 and availability in colleges and trade schools Mandatory AIDS training for all public school personnel, emergency services crews and health professionals. _ Mandatory testing and counseling for all convicted of sex crimes, prostitution or intravenous drug use Violent prison inmates would be tested at the request of the prison and approval of the local health officer. _ A procedure is created for confronting, examining, detaining and confining infected individuals who refuse to modify their behavior so they do n't pose a threat to others Due process protections are provided. _ Regional service networks will be set up in the six most populous counties by Oct. 1 _ Those who carry the AIDS virus, or who are perceived to have it, will be protected from discrimination <PERSON> Jule </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said he already had followed the bill's directive and created a new Office on AIDS. He said he began to confer with county health officials on setting up regional AIDS service centers across <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Those centers will do the mandatory and voluntary AIDS testing, counseling, public education, and outreach to `` street kids'' and other target populations. They also will plan and coordinate services to AIDS patients, develop volunteer networks and notify partners of infected people. `` This bill will make an enormous difference,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> of the Privacy Lobby and the gay rights <ORGANIZATION> Dorian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've taken a step toward making it safe to know your antibody status, whether you're at risk, and safe to seek public health -LRB- services -RRB-. `` In this state we've finally said civil rights and public health go hand-in-hand.'' `` The important thing is that we did get a statewide policy on AIDS,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Deccio </PERSON>, co-sponsor of the measure. `` It's the first omnibus bill of its kind in the country, so I guess it's the best available.''

 Checks that disintegrate into confetti shortly after being deposited have cost banks nearly $ 50,000 this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says.

In one case, a Northern customer deposited a $ 4,000 check in a savings account on Feb. 16, then withdrew the same amount a week later from one of the bank's branch offices, the memo said. The $ 4,000 check was returned to Northern in a check carrier on March 2, but by then it had been `` reduced to mere confetti, small bits of paper that appeared to be treated with chemicals that caused the paper to break into pieces to a point where it was impossible to identify any information on the check,'' the memo said.

<TEXT>
 A union negotiating committee has voted to submit a tentative contract for ratification by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 6,500 flight attendants, says a Teamsters official The 15-member committee met at Teamsters headquarters in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and approved the vote Wednesday night, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` My personal feeling is that yes, they will ratify it,'' <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. It will take about 30 days to complete the vote, he said. <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> declined to release details of the tentative accord, although he earlier confirmed that the contract will require all flight attendants to join the union. Both sides said the March 29 strike deadline, set by the flight attendants last week, provided the impetus for an agreement. The key issue has been <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s two-tier wage structure. The airline had proposed extending the lower-paid, B-scale to eight years from the current five years. B-scale flight attendants said the airline was trying to break a promise that they would earn A-scale wages after five years. The Star Tribune of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, citing unidentified sources, reported today that the tentative agreement calls for B-scale employees to move up after seven years.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's federally insured savings institutions lost $ 3.2 billion in the last three months of 1987, pushing the industry's losses for the year to a post-Depression record of $ 6.8 billion, the government said today. The industry, composed of 3,147 thrift institutions, had earned $ 132 million a year earlier. The 1987 loss was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous record of $ 4.6 billion, set in 1981, when the prime lending rate soared above 20 percent. The fourth quarter loss compared to a loss of $ 1.8 billion in the third quarter, 1.9 billion in the spring quarter and a profit of $ 100 million in the first three months of 1987. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which released the figures, said losses were heavily concentrated in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, which is dependent on the ailing oil and gas industry. Sixty-six percent of the institutions nationwide reported a total profit of $ 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, while the 1,058 unprofitable <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls lost $ 4.5 billion in all. For the year, the profitable two-thirds of the industry earned $ 6.6 billion, which was more than offset by the $ 13.4 billion deficit of the money-losing S & amp; Ls. The percentage of the industry earning a profit has steadily declined for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of 1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> _ lost a total of $ 2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year, accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said 345 of the S & amp; Ls were insolvent at the end of 1987 under regulatory accounting principles and 510 were insolvent under the stricter, generally accepted accounting principles that will be used beginning next year. An institution is considered insolvent when its loans and other assets are worth less than what it owes to depositors and other creditors. The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the fund backing deposits up to $ 100,000 in federally insured S & amp; Ls, has been hampered in closing insolvent S & amp; Ls by lack of money. Congress in August authorized a three-year, $ 10.8 billion recapitalization. Last month, the bank board announced a plan to spend $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion in insurance fund money to close insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions or merge them into healthier S & amp; Ls. The bank board is still accepting applications from private investors to participate in the restructuring and does n't plan any announcements before early April. The nation's 13,700 federally insured commercial banks earned $ 3.7 billion last year, their lowest profit since 1933, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this month.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director, is leaving the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> to join its smaller rival <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, it was announced today. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, a managing director at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> since leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, will handle all merchant banking activities and merger transactions for the <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. His departure from <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> comes against a background of turmoil within the venerable investment firm, a partial result of the uncertain outlook for Wall Street in the aftermath of the stock market crash five months ago. Several other high-ranking executives also have quit <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> recently, although <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today as saying his departure was unrelated to the company's problems. `` My experience at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> was absolutely agreeable and I have a high regard for -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> chairman -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said. `` ... There's one thing I could n't do there _ which is have my own shop.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> will take charge of a jointly owned firm called `` <ORGANIZATION> Stockman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ a <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> affiliate.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> to bolster <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>'s emerging merchant banking business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> will be an immensely valuable asset in meeting that goal,'' he said. `` He brings a global perspective on business and financial issues as well as intimate familiarity with both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese government policies.'' <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> recently represented <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 2 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> late last year and represented <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in its $ 2.6 billion acquisition by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, 41, was White House budget director from 1981 to 1985

 Two passenger trains collided head-on today in a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> suburb, killing 12 people and injuring more than 40, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. It was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fourth fatal train accident in three months. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s second official news agency, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said only seven were dead, including five Japanese, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldier and a railway worker. It said 40 to 50 people were hospitalized. The Japanese Embassy confirmed that a 193-member Japanese high school tour group was on one of the trains. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which arranged the tour, reported two Japanese killed and 29 injured. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said 11 Japanese were killed. The cause of the collision in the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Fengbang </LOCATION> was not immediately clear, said <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenghao </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations division. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, however, said one of the trains ignored a stop signal when it left the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> station. The crash occurred at about 2 p.m. when northbound train No. 311, leaving <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, collided with southbound train No. 208 arriving from <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said. No. 311's first two cars and the luggage car of No. 208 were knocked off the tracks, he said. Television footage by Japanese camera crews broadcast in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> showed the luggage car resting on one end of the other train's engine The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the two first-class passenger cars behind the No. 311 engine were crushed together by the force of the collision. The news service said <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> had rain and heavy fog today but did not say if this was believed to have contributed to the accident. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the No. 311 train `` rolled out of the <LOCATION> Kuangxiang </LOCATION> station, ignoring the prohibiting signal, and collided with the No. 208 train that was entering the station.'' <PERSON> Kengo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> of the Japanese Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said two people from a high school in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kochi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION> were among the dead, and 29 others were injured. Fu confirmed that Japanese students were among the dead and injured but said the number was not yet determined. `` We have n't heard any information about other nationalities,'' he added. `` We were playing cards and suddenly there was a loud bang, and things went flying all over the floor,'' said an unidentified male student interviewed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was a huge bump, and then one of our teachers came into the car and told us to get out,'' said another student. `` We broke the windows and climbed out.'' The train tracks were blocked seven hours after the accident, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said. He said soldiers, police and medical workers took the dead and injured to nearby hospitals and that investigators were at the scene trying to determine the cause. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Vice Mayor <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju </PERSON> also went to the scene, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In January, three separate train accidents killed 141 people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s minister of railways resigned this month to take responsibility for those accidents. This year's train accidents, together with a plane crash outside Chungking in January that killed all 108 people aboard, have prompted severe calls by the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government for greater attention to safety.

<TEXT>
 A pair of barges loaded with a flammable liquid today slammed into the end of the Pensacola Fishing Pier, a former bridge billed as the world's longest fishing pier. The barges were wedged into the L-shaped vehicular turnaround at the tip of the pier, formerly a highway bridge across <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> connecting <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> and Gulf Breeze. The bridge was divided into two sections, each becoming fishing piers. The <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> pier is 1.5 miles long. `` The wind caught it and blew him into the bridge -LRB- pier -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, risk manager for <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which owns the pier. `` It destroyed the end of the pier, a turnaround. It's not reparable.'' The pier is only 75 feet away from the new <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. Officials said they planned to block traffic on the new, four-lane bridge while attempts were made to pull the barges, which were tied together along with a towboat, from the pier. The barges were loaded with benzine, a colorless, flammable liquid used as a motor fuel and solvent in dry cleaning. None of the benzine apparently leaked, but officials were worried about possible fire or explosion. `` It's not the benzine, it's the vapor,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, an engineering technician for the county. `` It would go with one spark.'' One of the barges was pushed into the shipping channel, blocking navigation traffic.

<TEXT>
 Six Disneyland Hotel workers who rebelled against the Magic Kingdom's ban on facial hair were suspended for three days without pay and given an order to shave or be fired. The hotel's 1,600 workers recently came under the famed amusement park's dress and grooming codes when their former boss, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sold the property to the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The dress code, established in 1957, bans facial hair on men, mandates short haircuts and bars women from wearing heavy makeup, long fingernails or excessive jewelry. The six suspended Wednesday have until Monday to shave or lose their jobs, said <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. A dozen male employees have been issued warnings for facial hair, and although half of those shaved, all 12 filed grievances with their unions. Earlier Wednesday, the five unions representing hotel workers united in opposition to the Disney dress code, but would n't say whether they were willing to strike over it.

 A Hindu occult priest strangled a 7-year-old girl to offer her blood to a goddess in a ritual and stored her body in his temple complex, it was reported Thursday. The priest, <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangadhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Poojary </PERSON>, and four others were arrested after residents of <LOCATION> Manpada </LOCATION> village in the central Indian <LOCATION> Maharashtra </LOCATION> state complained of a foul smell and called police, the <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and Patriot newspapers said. Police Inspector R.M. <PERSON> Patil </PERSON> said the body of the girl, identified as <PERSON> Nandita </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinde </PERSON>, was found in the loft of a building near the temple. It was hidden in fodder and cow dung. Police said the priest apparently called the girl inside the temple Friday, the newspapers said. He was believed to have strangled her and cut an artery in her left leg to draw blood for the ritual offering aimed at pleasing a goddess, they said. Human sacrifices are outlawed in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but still occur from time to time, mainly in rural areas.

 Here's a sampling of what newspapers abroad are saying about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election campaign and the candidates seeking the Republican and Democratic nominations:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- conservative -RRB-, on Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` The rest of the world should start thinking about a possible President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> And a possible President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should start thinking about the rest of the world. `` His apparent ignorance of it will provoke the traditional censoriousness about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politicians, not just from Europeans, but from well-bred Americans. ... `` Unlike most American politicians, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speaks a foreign language -LRB- Spanish -RRB-. This means he addresses the newly-important Hispanic vote in its mother tongue. If it means much else, it is something to worry about. If American politicians start addressing special groups of voters in languages unintelligible to the majority, it is one more denial of the notion of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as melting pot.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ The Independent of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- independent -RRB-, on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` It is tempting to conclude that he achieved this pre-eminent position because of the errors and failings of his opponents rather than through his own efforts It is true that his chief rival, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, has had a disastrous campaign following his one transient success in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But to give Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credit, his campaign has been almost faultless and it was largely due to his good organization and well-lined campaign coffers that he was able to recover so convincingly after the setback in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ITALY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ La Repubblica, national -LRB- liberal -RRB-: `` The dilemma that confronts the candidates is not between the ` poor' and the ` rich. ... The dilemma is in the schizophrenia of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, divided by the desire not to change anything and the fear of not being able to stay the same. `` This uncertainty, more than the fear of confronting the unknown in the cursed equation ` Italian equals Mafia', is the real calculation that has kept <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> out of the competition. His capital of expectations and fascination is too big to be gambled today on the roulette of the American mood in 1988.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MALAYSIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ New Straits Times of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, English language -LRB- pro-government -RRB-: `` Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> terrified Americans about the invasion of cheaper foreign goods `` His clarion call to raise high the trade barriers in retaliation for unfair trade practices summoned few followers to the barricades, and his campaign should be spluttering to a halt soon.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Times of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, English-language -LRB- independent -RRB-: `` ... this year's most watchable ` devil' _ at least as far as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was concerned _ was laid low by -LRB- Super Tuesday's -RRB- results We are referring, of course, to the forceful voice of articulate, and therefore frightening, nationalistic protectionism: Democratic Congressman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. ... But Tuesday's outcome almost certainly ensures that he will not be the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> standard bearer in November.''

There are liberal millionaires here _ many more than people in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> think _ such as the two senators from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, a Republican, and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, a Democrat. ... We presume that on the Democratic side these liberals will reinforce <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the least bad of the Democratic candidates. ... `` The <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ` express' seems unstoppable. ... However, he's not as bad as Brazilians might imagine He's from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> elite.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee today rejected a move by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> to require new intelligence studies of what <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> says are Soviet missiles unaccounted for by the U.S.-Soviet treaty on medium-range atomic weapons. The committee voted 15-2 against <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' amendment to the treaty which would have required President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to certify the accuracy of the Soviet claims that there are 650 SS-20 missiles. The declared weapons will have to be destroyed after the treaty takes effect. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, argued that up to 300 more SS-20s are `` hidden,'' and he cited <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reports which he said support his claim. But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., said, `` I do n't believe President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have signed this treaty'' if he believed the Soviets had successfully hidden a large force of SS-20 missiles The vote was the latest decision in which the panel decided by large bipartisan majorities to reject attempts by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, another conservative critic, to change the treaty. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, said the panel was headed toward overwhelming approval of the pact. `` I would hope _ and I think _ that we will continue to show strong bipartisan support,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> after the panel voted by lopsided margins Wednesday to reject amendments by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> had originally proposed 36 amendments and <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> offered three more, despite appeals from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to approve the treaty without changes. After it became apparent he had few votes on his side, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he planned to drop most of his amendments. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> announced that the committee will finish voting on all amendments by Tuesday afternoon next week and will then decide on the treaty itself. When the measure finally reaches the floor, overwhelming approval is expected with no more than 10 to 12 of the 100 senators expected to vote against it. Ratification requires a two-thirds vote. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, requires the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. It includes on-site inspection among its strict verification provisions. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> dropped many of his amendments after he came under fire from fellow Republicans, some of whom claimed he was trying to delay a final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote until after the next summit meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. That meeting has now been set for May 29-June 2 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the White House announced Wednesday. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., said: `` We're just in a delay, stall situation which I find disagreeable ... If you do n't have the votes and just try to overload it with amendments, that is n't fair. Meantime, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and other Democrats tried to work out some type of compromise between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the chief remaining hurdle, a dispute about the legal power to interpret treaties. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said in a floor speech that it will be necessary to add a reservation or an understanding which spells out the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` This matter is not going to be resolved, in my judgment, by any exchange of letters, because a future administration can say, ` we do n't agree with that interpretation at all,''' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserts that the executive branch can unilaterally change the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intepretation of a treaty, a view disputed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The fight arises from a difference in how to interpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. As it worked through the treaty, the panel:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ Voted down, 12-3, a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> proposal to change the treaty and allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to deploy non-nuclear cruise missiles The treaty bans all cruise missiles, whether equipped with nuclear or conventional warheads, because there is no effective way to verify which warheads are on the missile. _ Voted down, 12-2, a Helms amendment which would include the Soviets' Scud B missile as one of the banned weapons The missile is not now banned because it has a shorter range than 300 miles, but <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> claimed Scud B missiles sold by the Soviets to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been fired at ranges which would fall within the INF ranges. _ Rejected, 13-2, a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> plan that would prohibit either side from testing missiles in the INF range _ Defeated, 15-2, a Pressler amendment which would block the treaty from taking effect until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certifies that there is parity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces The Soviets have a large advantage in some categories of non-nuclear weapons and <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> and other treaty critics say the elimination of medium-range atomic missiles will take away a major <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> deterrent to a Soviet attack.

But he said his threat to burn to death a 10-week-old dog at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION> campus Monday served its purpose in getting attention. The threat drew protest calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Dane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and local radio stations. `` People panicked to save the life of one mythical puppy while thousands -LRB- of people -RRB- were dying'' elsewhere, Read said. The student said he opposed cruelty to animals and never intended to carry out his threat, despite earlier claims he was serious that prompted humane society officials and university police to investigate. Police said Wednesday they would consider seeking an injunction against Read's plan to kill the dog. Earlier, <PERSON> Read </PERSON> said burning the puppy would be `` an exhibition of what suffering and cruelty is all about,'' he said. `` I think our attitudes about war and human suffering are complacency and numbness. This is one thing that will combat that numbness.'' Read, 26, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nihilist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a campus organization the university said does not have its official recognition. He said the group, organized two years ago, has about 12 active members who advocate nihilism, a belief that existing social institutions need destroying to make room for a new order. The group announced the puppy-burning plan Tuesday. Radio stations, humane societies and police said Wednesday they were flooded with telephone calls. Read said he anticipated the reaction. `` I'm quite pleased,'' he said. `` I'm the most reviled character in town.'' He said he had <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in mind when he conceived of the idea of burning the dog to demonstrate suffering. He said people living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lead sheltered, comfortable lives and avoid thinking about the horrors occurring in other nations. `` I want them to get down and wallow in the filth, which is truth,'' he said. Shock is the best method of making people aware of ugliness, he said, calling peaceful protest a waste of time. His organization has distributed obscene posters on the campus, including one portraying <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> pointing a gun and reading: `` I love you.''

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> cautioned presidential candidates on Thursday to avoid `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bashing'' in their campaigning, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> spoke to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> civil service subcommittee as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. His 37-member panel is working on recommendations for making civil service more attractive to talented individuals. While the presidential candidates do n't seem to be `` running against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' this year, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> hinted he's ready with a strong lecture for anyone who tries such an approach. `` We're never very far from the telephone,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. `` We will try to keep after those candidates. ... We will urge them to stay on the high road.'' He suggested attacks by candidates on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> institutions have hurt the image of public service. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> called it `` the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bashing syndrome.'' `` Too many of the best at the upper ranks have been leaving government, with not enough of quality being recruited at the entry level,'' said <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who retired from government service last summer. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who worked for the governmment most of his life, including eight years as head of the nation's central bank, recently became a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of a small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., chairwoman of the subcommittee, told <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>: `` Hopefully, we can head off a race in which everyone sees how bad a thing they can say about public service. `` The last two presidents have gratuitously slandered the bureaucracy,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, who was mentioned as a possible 1988 presidential contender herself before she withdrew from consideration. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> who serves with <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> on the commission, told the subcommittee that `` we've been seeing a change'' toward the positive in public attitudes toward government service. `` Part of this is the ironic success President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had in getting people to feel better about the government. It's ironic because I do n't think he meant it that way. He had two campaigns against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` No candidates this time have picked up on the theme of bashing government and bashing bureaucrats,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> added. `` There is a good climate to create a different set of attitudes.'' Members of the commission also include former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said today he was willing to release information on more than $ 1 million in loans taken out by his presidential campaign, but members of his staff who heard the senator's remarks said no decision had been made on the matter. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s pledge to release the material came in the wake of a report in a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, newspaper that his campaign had put up the proceeds of future fund-raisers and federal matching funds as collateral for almost $ 1.5 million borrowed from banks about two weeks ago. `` I have no problem with telling you the amount of the loans and which banks they came from, be glad to,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said details of the loans would be contained in reports to be filed in the next two or three weeks with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> `` so if you can wait two or three weeks all of that will be available, but as for now I have no problem with giving you the amount of the loans, the banks et cetera.'' However, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Armour </PERSON> said as the candidate was leaving the news conference that no decision had been made on releasing the information. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign previously has acknowledged only that it had established a $ 1 million line of credit to be used as necessary for television advertising on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> borrowed $ 750,000 from Sovran Bank-D.C. National, a Washington-based bank which handles his campaign accounts, The Tennessean reported. The remainder of the loans came from a collection of small banks in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the Democrat's home state, the newspaper said. Each of the banks has strong <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ties, the paper said. Officials at each of the banks refused to comment on whether <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had received a loan. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s staff has refused to give any details of campaign loans. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> pledged future federal matching funds against the Sovran loan, a standard presidential campaign procedure, The Tennessean reported, quoting sources familiar with the transaction. At the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> banks, the candidate pledged the proceeds of future fund-raising events, and in at least some cases, guaranteed 10 percent of the note on his personal signature, the report said. `` The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign has made complete disclosure of our finances every four weeks as required by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' campaign manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` For me to disclose the details of our finances before the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reporting date would be to give key strategic information to the other candidates a full month before they are entitled to have it and that would be a disservice to my campaign,'' he said. The next <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reporting date is April 20. The loans were taken out after Feb. 29 so they did not have to be disclosed March 20. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign officials talked with a number of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> banks about participating in the loans, which were used to finance a media blitz before the March 8 primaries and caucuses in 20 states, the paper says. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won five of those contests. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> laws and regulations require that any loans be transacted `` in the ordinary course of business,'' have a written instrument, have a due date or amortization schedule, and be subject to `` the usual and customary rate of interest'' charged by the bank. The due date for the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> loans is July 15, three days before the Democratic National Convention begins in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The latest <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> FEC disclosure, made public Sunday, covers the period from Feb. 1 to Feb. 29. It shows that, to date, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has spent $ 6 million on his presidential bid, and had $ 342,964 in cash on hand as of Feb. 29. Campaign sources have said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s bid raised almost $ 1 million in the first 15 days of March, the paper reported.

<HEAD>Ferry Workers Protest in Channel-blocking Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 350 government workers demonstrated Thursday in a week-old strike that has virtually halted ferry service across the English Channel. A delegation of protesters met with <PERSON> Pierre-Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Drege </PERSON>, chief of staff for the Secretary of State for Maritime Affairs, where the protest was held. Government officials refused to comment afterward, saying the conflict must be settled by the sailors' employer, the state-run railroad. Railroad officials have said they will not negotiate with the strikers until they end their occupation of the ferry Nord-Pas de <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>. The strikers are protesting what they say is a threatened privatization of their company and loss of purchasing power. On the other side of the Channel, about 2,200 employees of P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> have been striking for seven weeks. Thursday's demonstrators arrived in buses from the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> port cities of <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dieppe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>. They represented about a third of the 990 officers and sailors working on ferries for the railroads' maritime arm. Traffic remained backed up at Channel ports on the French side Thursday, where only one ferry _ with a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> crew _ was in operation between <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION> and the British port of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hawks Have Almost Human-Like Ability To Stalk Prey, Researcher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Time after time, the big jackrabbit avoids attacks by the five <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hawks that dive and feint with the precision of a military unit. But finally, the rabbit is exhausted and a powerful talon slashes quickly. The hunt ends and winged predators feed together. In a report to be published Friday in Science magazine, biologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said he repeatedly witnessed such coordinated hunting by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hawks. It is, he said, the first documented proof that hawks are able to organize and cooperate with almost human skill in such a complex series of manuevers. `` People have suggested it in the past, but this is the first documentation of it,'' said <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON>, who is director of higher education research at the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in <LOCATION> Kempton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. `` We expected to see two hawks hunting together. I was amazed to see units of four, five and six hawks. ... We got to see it repeatedly,'' <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Cooperative hunting, in which predators work together to kill prey larger than they could bring down individually, is well known among lions, wolves, hyenas, wild dogs, killer whales _ and humans. But <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said his study shows that hawks also are able to hunt together for their mutual benefit. In more than 400 hours of observations at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Medanos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raptor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said he watched groups of five to six hawks use two basic coordinated attacks to bring down rabbits. <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said the most common tactic, which he called the surprise pounce, required the hawks to attack a rabbit from several different directions at once, forcing it to stay away from cover. `` They will work the rabbit in such a way that it becomes mentally and physically exhausted,'' <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said. `` They keep it moving and keep it making decisions until it makes the wrong decision.'' <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said if the rabbit leaves its back unprotected, a hawk swoops in and delivers a lethal blow to the back of the neck. That's the only way, said <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON>, that a Harris hawk, which weighs about 2 pounds, can kill a jackrabbit, which can weigh as much as 7 pounds. Another tactic <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> observed is what he calls the `` flush and ambush.'' A team of hawks, e said, will chase a rabbit until it finally takes cover. Two or three hawks will perch nearby and a pair of the birds will land near the rabbit and try to flush it from the cover. When the bunny finally flees, the perched hawks drop swiftly for the kill. Even dinner time is coordinated for the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hawks, <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said. When the hawks are feeding, two of the group will remain at a nearby high place, on the lookout for eagles or ospreys or other species who might try to steal the kill. When an intruder is spotted, the sentinel will sound an alarm and the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hawks rise and attack together, usually chasing away the invader. <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said most of the hawk groups that hunt together are extended families that may include a mated pair, yearlings and older offspring. The group usually is no larger than six. The female is the larger of the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hawks and usually dominates the group, <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said. But on the hunt, the female is less likely to attack the prey and more likely to play `` a distractor role.'' `` She distracts the prey and keeps it in play for the other hawks, forcing it back into the area of vulnerability,'' the researcher said. He said birds seem to communicate with body movement. As the hunt begins, he birds will perch hundreds of yards apart. When one of the hawks sights a possible meal, its movement quickly attracts the other birds and the hunt is on, <PERSON> Bednarz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hawks live in the deserts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. They feed on rodents and lizards during part of the year, but apparently hunt together to bring down jackrabbits and desert cottontail rabbits in the winter months.

 Billions of locusts are moving across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the worst plague since 1954, blotting out the sun and settling on the land like a black, ravenous carpet to strip it clean of vegetation. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> have put aside political differences to fight the locusts, with help from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday it may not be possible to save the food supply. As many as 250,000 of the insects settle on each acre whent the horde alights. They devour 100,000 tons of crops and other vegetation at each stop, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Wind currents pushed the insects into northeastern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from their breeding grounds, The <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> said. They fly in waves of up to 50 million per square kilometer over 400 square kilometers, which means as many as 20 billion covering an area of 160 square miles. `` We are facing a very dangerous situation, which may affect <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s food production for years to come,'' said <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brader </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not optimistic that the situation can be effectively controlled.'' He said the current infestation is worse than the 1950s plague, which lasted more than 10 years. Breeding has been aided by abundant rains and heat in the area, <PERSON> Brader </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement: `` We are in a state of general alert. Swift and decisive action is needed to avoid a major regional food crisis later this year.'' <PERSON> Brader </PERSON> said $ 30 million had been donated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and others to finance the spraying of pesticide on infested areas. He said at least $ 150 million will be needed to fight the plague, which he said may peak in late summmer. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has sprayed more than 494,000 acres of land and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> has been treating about 62,000 acres a day. No figures were available for <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Published reports in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> say more than 40 aircraft have been provided by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to spray crop and pasture land threatened by locusts. Spraying has been hampered by inadequate and outdated pesticide and equipment, the presence of nomads in some infested regions and the difficulty of detecting locusts in areas of sand, rock and scrubland, officials said. No estimate was available of the total damage to crops. Specialists say the locusts originated near the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, invading <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and then swarming through the Sahel countries below the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> before moving north `` in a tidal wave.'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> also are threatened.

<HEAD>Poor Pay Disproportionately More in Sales Taxes, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's poorest families, with incomes averaging less than $ 8,600 a year, pay five times as much of their earnings for state sales and excise taxes as those who make more than $ 600,000, a research and advocacy group reported Thursday. `` The less you make, the worse you do,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, director of Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, said in releasing a comprehensive study of taxes in the 50 states. The unfairness is especially bad in states that impose heavy taxes on food, utilities, tobacco and fuels, he said. It is not just the poor who spend a disproportionate share on sales and excise taxes, such as those applying to alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, the study found. A four-member family earning $ 31,000 a year spends three times as much of its income on these taxes, compared with the richest Americans. Sales and excise taxes generally are at a flat rate, meaning that in a state with a 5 percent tax that applies to food, for example, the rich and poor would pay the same $ 1 tax on a $ 20 bag of groceries. Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which is financed by labor unions and liberal social organizations, opposes such `` consumption taxes'' because they are not based on ability to pay. There is some support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a national sales tax to replace at least part of the income tax. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, whose organization was a major influence in the thorough revision of the federal income tax enacted in 1986, said some `` tax reformers'' spend too much time in pursuit of the perfect income tax while ignoring the onerous burden that sales taxes create for the poor. `` That's a mistake, because the worst state income tax in the nation is still a far sight fairer than any state sales tax,'' he said. In 23 states, the disparity between shares of income taken by sales and excise taxes is worse than the national average, the report said. The poor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> pay about seven times as much of their earnings in sales and excise taxes as do the rich; in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, almost six times as much. The study found: _ The poorest 20 percent of four-member families, averaging income of $ 8,581, paid 5.4 percent of their earnings in sales and excise taxes last year _ The second one-fifth, averaging $ 20,535, paid 3.9 percent _ The third, averaging $ 31,497, paid 3.3 percent _ The fourth, averaging $ 44,910, paid 2.9 percent _ The highest-earning one-fifth, averaging $ 66,912, paid 2.5 percent _ The top-earning 5 percent, averaging $ 187,316, paid 1.6 percent _ Four-member families averaging $ 612,122 a year _ the richest 0.7 percent of Americans _ paid 1.1 percent of their incomes for sales and excise taxes Until states begin relying more on income taxes, <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said, sales taxes can be made less onerous by extending rebates to the poor. The taxes also could be applied disproportionately to services that are generally used by the well-to-do, such as club memberships and home-improvement services, he suggested. Only six states have sales-tax credits for the poor, and only in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> does the credit offset more than half of the burden for low-income people. The other five are <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sixteen states, including the 10 with the most onerous sales taxes on the poor, all tax food, the study found. They are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The poor spend 6.2 percent of income on electrical bills, more than double the rate of the middle-income family. But that middle-income family pays three times as big a share for electricity as do the rich, the study found. The portion of the $ 600,000-a-year family's income spent for tax on take-home beer is only 15 percent of the $ 8,600 family's share. On cigarettes, the upper-income family's share is 1 percent of the low-income family's; on gasoline, 4 percent; on fresh flowers, 98 percent; on legal fees, 100 percent; jewelry, 259 percent; wine for home consumption, 324 percent, and out-of-town lodging, 613 percent.

<HEAD>Experts Urge Next Administration To Put Mideast Peace on Front

<TEXT>
 A panel of <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> experts on Thursday urged the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to place <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks high on its foreign policy agenda and to include negotiators approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` A prolonged impasse in the peace process could endanger <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> national interests,'' the panel of 19 academicians and former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said in a report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the study. `` We would like to see a steady, high-level commitment of American resources to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace process,'' the report said. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1985, said the panel `` has a very strong sense that it's going to take a protracted investment by senior levels to achieve even partial success.'' Speaking at a news conference, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace plan offered in 1982 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lacked sufficient preparation, while the one currently being proposed by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> may be the victim of bad timing. Any future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan must be presented at a time when both Arabs and Israelis are ready for peace talks, he said. The Palestinians may be too `` eupohoric'' over their success in the 3 -LCB- - month uprising against the Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to be ready for the compromises each side must make in negotiations, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON>, a senior research fellow at Brookings and the project's coordinator, said the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace issue has not been high on the U.S.-Soviet agenda so far. It should be explored in that framework further to see if it can yield some solutions, he added. The report's authors agreed that <LOCATION> Israeli-Arab </LOCATION> peace talks should be conducted within an international framework, although such a forum would not be empowered to impose solutions. The <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan contains a similar proviso. `` Palestinians should be represented in any negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by spokesmen of their own choosing, whether in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation or in some other configuration,'' the report said. The <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan envisions Palestinian representation as part of a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation in peace talks. `` The tone, though, seems to be that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> can choose the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON> said. `` Palestinians are unlikely to come forward to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without having the implicit endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuse to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> directly. <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON> said panel members differed on whether the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should be included in negotiations, and also could not agree on whether Palestinians should be given an independent state. Some argued that inclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state would be `` irritants'' that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would reject, he said. The experts believe substantial preparation is needed to get the parties `` to be willing to make hard choices'' before bringing them to the negotiating table, <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other officials have conducted preparatory talks with Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders since January, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing for negotiations to begin by May 1.

<HEAD>Drivers Start Returning Cash Spilled from Armored Truck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of honest citizens showed up at police stations across the city Thursday to return thousands of dollars in cash that fell out of an armored truck, police said. `` We have a lot of very honest people here,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. On Wednesday night, however, money-grabbing chaos erupted on <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s Gardiner Expressway after the rear door of the armored truck flew open and spewed a blizzard of bills that blew onto windshields and covered the highway. Drivers stopped their cars in the middle of the road in the rush for cash, and traffic was tied up for miles. A guard in the <ORGANIZATION> Loomis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> truck eventually had to pull his gun to halt the free-for-all. Two bags that each contained $ 75,000 _ worth about $ 60,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> _ were scooped up by drivers who threw the booty into their cars and sped away and have not been returned, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. A third bag holding the same amount broke open, spreading the cash in the air. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said auditors were counting up how much was returned. Under Canadian law, the cash belongs to <PERSON> Loomis </PERSON> and not whoever finds it. One cab driver was charged with theft for grabbing some of the money.

<HEAD>Detroit's Black Mayor Tones Down Criticism of Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, long at political odds with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, is striking a more conciliatory tone toward the Democratic presidential candidate this year. `` I'd be a fool not to recognize the massive contribution <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has made to the electoral process, and putting some color _ finally _ in the rainbow,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` Obviously ... that's not enough to win, but it's an important beginning.'' Young still argues that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s candidacy represents wasted votes, political polarization and help for the Republicans. But he also credits <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for reaching some whites with his more mainstream Democratic candidacy this year, and expressing surprise at his degree of support from blacks. Young is supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s statewide caucuses Saturday. He says his is not so much an endorsement as a statement of whom he supports _ a distinction <PERSON> Young </PERSON> says means the political organization that has served him for 15 years as mayor of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is free to do as it wishes. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has a tremendous emotional appeal to the black community in this city,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday in his office with several out-of-town reporters. `` I think that the chief objective ... is to win the White House.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is airing radio ads featuring Young's support, targeted at black audiences in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He is bidding to win delegates in the city's two largely black congressional districts, the 1st and 13th, which requires winning at least 15 percent of the vote in those areas. Young maintained that he has `` truly'' released his organization to go as it pleases and says he's not asked key supporters to report back on whether they are siding with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or another candidate. Some politicians are n't so sure, however. State House Speaker <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>, backing <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he understood <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was `` coming down hard'' on his supporters to produce for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, particularly in those key congressional districts. In announcing his support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a week and a half ago, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, `` Anybody who respects my opinion will do likewise.'' And <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s top political aide, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, said last week that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> would ask his staff members to inform him of their actions in the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who has seen his city's optimism decline with the fall in federal urban aid under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November is his paramount concern and his reason for supporting the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, has the best chance to win. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he said, `` ca n't win.'' Young finds fault with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lack of government experience, but said no black candidate could be elected this year or in the immediate future because of white resistance. `` I think it's rooted in race _ I do n't have to look anywhere else,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Even if he should win <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would achieve at best a plurality of the Democratic vote, not a majority. `` The great majority of the black votes will follow <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> off to one side, whereas the great majority of the white vote will be split among the other candidates,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` That is the essense of polarization. `` I think the overall thrust of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign might very well be to help the Republicans,'' he said. Young endorsed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and he has remained apart from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this year even as some other black leaders who were cool toward <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> four years ago have been won over. While there may be political risks for himself, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he thinks voters' attitudes toward him wo n't be affected. `` I'm trying to preserve the unity _ I do not want to be responsible for creating any disunity in the black community,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today called the Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement `` an important step forward'' and said there is `` no excuse'' for any additional Soviet bloc weapons deliveries to the Sandinista government. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reacted with cautious optimism to the agreement while <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> hailed it as `` a new chapter in the unhappy history of that war-torn country.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to immediately approve additional humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels while they negotiate terms for a definitive cease-fire with the Sandinista government. He said the agreement would not have been possible without years of sacrifice by the rebels. `` Their strength and perseverance have created this opportunity for peace and freedom,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` We consider this agreement to be an important step forward.'' Under questioning, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he feels the agreement may be a ploy on the part of the Sandinistas to disarm the Contras. He said that if the Sandinistas do n't carry out their promises under the agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to reevaluate its policies. Both the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> promised to seek quick action on a humanitarian aid package for the Contra rebels. `` We're glad that it occurred,'' the <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, when asked whether the administration was embracing the plan. `` There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to balance those two off,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen processes like this start before and fail,'' he said. `` This seems like a more concrete step, and there certainly reason to be hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skepticism side of it either because we are skeptical.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would meet Monday with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to begin drafting a bill to send food, clothing, shelter and medicine to the rebels before Easter. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, too, hopes an aid package can be passed `` on a bipartisan basis'' before the recess. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the precise form of the aid package remained to be worked out, but that it would have to conform to the cease-fire agreement announced Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, after three days of talks. That agreement calls for `` exclusively humanitarian aid'' to be channeled through a neutral, international relief organization. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> refused to speculate on whether there would be <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> demands to include in the package some standby procedure for authorizing new military aid for the rebels should the peace process become derailed. Republicans, contending Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> can not be trusted to fulfill his promises without such a threat, have insisted on such a provision in previous debate on the issue. `` I think it would be counterproductive to talk about it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters. `` We do n't want to rekindle the war.'' He said he envisioned quick action on `` some minimal something that both sides -LRB- Democrats and Republicans -RRB- can wholeheartedly embrace.'' `` For heaven's sake, if the Nicaraguans, who have been shooting at each other, can agree, then surely Republicans and Democrats can agree,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> began discussing ideas for an aid package on Wednesday in conversations with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> But he said no deals had been made. `` The cease-fire talks have made it possible, by entering into an entirely new era, to bury our hatchets in the same trenches where they're burying their machetes in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The aid bill likely would be similar to a $ 30 million package rejected by a narrow margin on March 3, although <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said it was unclear whether the dollar amount would be the same The rebels' last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid expired on Feb. 29. Earlier, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is wracked by poverty and needs to begin diverting its slender resources to educate, feed, and clothe its people. `` Both sides were war-weary but were ready if they could to find an accommodation to guarantee the integration back into their society of these people who have been estranged from it,'' he said. Problems remain, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, but `` there is a disposition on both parts to enter into a more peaceful society and a more democratic society in which freedom of the press and of expression will be guaranteed and the rights of those who formerly made war against that government will be fully protected.'' `` Those of us in our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are anxious to do whatever we can to encourage the fulfilment of the democratization of that country,'' he said. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said three officials from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> were leaving for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> today to track the disposition of small arms, ammunition, jeeps and other materials that were brought to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent last week to respond to a Sandinista incursion. `` My concern is that the deployment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops and weapons to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> could in fact be another diversion of arms to the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation.

<TEXT>
 Six members of a laboratory group who were detained during a search for a missing frozen head have filed false arrest claims with the county totaling $ 225,000. The six claims, filed individually at various times this month, stem from the December beheading of 83-year-old <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> so her head could be frozen to preserve it for theoretical revival using as-yet undiscovered medical techniques. The six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> were detained by police Jan. 7 during a search of the premises. They were questioned at the police department then released. All six say they were arrested for investigation of obstruction of justice. Filing a claim is a preliminary step toward suing. <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has the option of settling the claims, or rejecting them after they are reviewed by claims adjustors. In one claim, five <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> members contend they `` suffered emotional stress arising from the purposeful, wrongful conduct of the coroner's investigators.'' They seek damages totaling $ 125,000. The sixth person filed a separate claim for $ 100,000. During two searches at the lab, authorities found Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s hands and some equipment allegedly stolen from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Her head never was found. Last month, the coroner's office ruled the woman's death a homicide, finding she had been killed by a lethal dose of barbiturates. <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> officials contend the woman was dead when they began their procedure. The case was sent to the district attorney's office, but Prosecutor <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> said Thursday no decision regarding charges has been made.

 West German opposition leader <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> today praised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arms-control advances and said the atmosphere had greatly improved since their last meeting five years ago. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters after a 20-minute meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House that he and the president had discussed arms control, the economy and human rights. `` We had a very friendly and constructive conversation with the president,'' he said. `` I ... said, remembering five years back, we are very impressed especially by the INF -LRB- Intermediate Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty, by the cooperation which developed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> he hoped he and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also would be able to agree soon on reducing long-range nuclear forces. He said the president `` seemed to be satisfied about the work, what has been done in the last two or three days. They worked very hard, they worked very -LRB- thoroughly -RRB- through the details.'' He was referring to a visit by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who has been meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. `` Remembering my visit five years ago, it is a remarkable change. It was a relaxed conversation. There are still some points of different views and different opinions, but there are points which we join and which we agree -LRB- on -RRB-.'' `` In'83 we were in the middle of the argument about the deployment of Pershing II and there have been some other fields of different opinions. Many of them are gone. The president making the INF treaty and preparing START is a president more close to us than some remarks and some positions of'81 or'82 or'83,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. The Social Democrats were part of the widespread opposition to NAT0's deployment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medium-range Pershing II and cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to counter Soviet SS-20 missiles aimed at <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The INF treaty would eliminate both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based medium-range missiles. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> listened but did n't comment when he told him that West German Social Democrats, like the coalition government, oppose modernization of short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said he made clear that the Social Democrats go further than the government in urging negotiations to eliminate the weapons. `` I think he was not surprised,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, advocates a reduction in the number of the missiles but not their elimination. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> favor the modernization of the short-range weapons as part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear deterrent against a Soviet bloc attack on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Anti-smoking Bill Introduced in Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill introduced in Parliament on Thursday would allow Britons to demand to be segregated from smokers at work. The measure lacks the support of the Conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and was given little chance of passage, but it reflected a growing anti-smoking campaign. `` Smoking must now be treated like any other industrial heath hazard,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who introduced the Health and Safety at Work Bill in the House of Commons. He said there was `` overwhelming'' public support to ban smoking at work except in designated areas. The bill would not require companies to set up non-smoking areas in offices, but it would forbid them from firing or disciplining any worker who refused to work alongside a smoker. Smokers are rarely segregated in British restaurants and other public places, although smoking has been banned in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subways and the number of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> cars where smoking is permitted has been reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent. The Independent newspaper said a private survey of 1,000 companies found that almost half had either a voluntary or formal agreement on no-smoking areas. In a report released Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said passive smoking, or non-smokers' exposure to smoke, may cause several hundred lung cancer deaths a year. It said passive smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by 10 to 30 percent. In government reaction to the report, <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> said, `` The government accepts the thrust of the report, which reflects established policies of voluntary arrangements.'' The state-funded <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 457,000 advertising campaign Thursday with full-page advertisements in major newspapers urging non-smokers to stand up for their rights. The ads say, `` If you're a non-smoker who works with smokers, you probably suffer in silence. Yet everybody has the right to a healthy working environment.''

<HEAD>Two Rival Associations Fighting Over Movie Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 For 58 hours after <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> tumbled into an abandoned well, hundreds of rescuers worked together to free her. But now they are divided over TV movie rights and have formed two rival groups. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, now almost 2 years old, was trapped 22 feet down an abandoned well after she fell in Oct. 14 and rescued after teams bored through rock to reach her. Rescuers dug a parallel shaft and then a tunnel into the well near the spot where <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> was stuck. One of the associations formed over a TV movie is committed to producer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The group's 32 members, most of them rescue volunteers, have been asking all participants to join them. The group, called the <ORGANIZATION> Jessica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McClure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescuers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is headed by <PERSON> Kragg </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rathole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> diverted a rathole rig from a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> project to dig much of the parallel shaft. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON>, said today that no plans have yet been announced by the group. `` I do n't think they have accepted a proposal,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The second group, the <ORGANIZATION> McClure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is comprised of municipal workers, including Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Czech </PERSON>, Fire Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and Paramedic <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, who plucked the child from the well and brought her to the surface. Some rescuers have decided to stay neutral. `` I personally do n't feel that I should join any association until a uniform group is together,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>. `` And that means all people involved, whether they are with the police department, the fire department or the lady who made hamburgers at three in the morning.'' <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> company that donated jackhammers and other pneumatic equipment for the rescue.

<HEAD>Man Sues To Block Changes On Controversial Mosaic</HEAD>

 The son of a mosaic designer has gone to court to try to prevent the city from altering the art work's portrayal of a smiling black man celebrating his freedom from slavery <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> filed suit this week seeking a preliminary injunction barring the city from changing the mosaic outside City Hall `` because of the love I have for my father's memory,'' he said Wednesday. `` I do n't want to see the change made because in my opinion you set a precedent to change paintings, books,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` It offends me. If you do n't like the smile on the <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, are you going to change it?'' A hearing was set for Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In his lawsuit, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said alterations to his late father's `` work of art'' would violate constitutional rights to free speech and artistic expression The 10 - by 40-foot mosaic shows white settlers in covered wagons and a freed slave, with a broken rope hanging from his wrists, celebrating his freedom Complaints about the portrayal began in 1986. Opponents contend it was demeaning to blacks because it does not show them making any contribution to the city. In October, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> agreed to remove the man's smile, add other facial features and replace the ropes with a hoe. Groups favoring the change said they would pay for alterations. Tim Early, chairman of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a supporter of the change, said work would begin as weather allowed. Early also said the mosaic, constructed in the mid-1960s, was not the work of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> Sr. alone but had been designed by a committee. `` I'm sure his father assisted in terms of artistic direction. But to give him full credit is just wrong,'' Early said.

<HEAD>National Program of Cholesterol Testing Set for May 4</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of hospitals will offer free blood cholesterol testing May 4 in the first national screening for the fatty substance that is a leading contributor to heart disease and strokes. The program, organized by the Voluntary Hospitals of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was outlined Thursday at a news confrence. Officials said they were announcing the national program well in advance to give people plenty of time to learn where they can go for testing. About 400 not-for-profit hospitals that are members of the association have agreed to participate, and organizers estimate 400,000 Americans will get the test. While most will do the test free, a few will charge $ 3. A public service television spot promoting the program, called `` CountDown <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' will begin airing next week. It includes a toll-free telephone number _ 800-634-9541 _ for people to call weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. -LRB- EST -RRB- to find out which hospitals in their areas will offer the testing. `` We want every American adult to know his or her cholesterol level and if it's high, do something about it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> and Surgeons and a member of the staff at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Blood cholesterol levels below 200 milligrams are associated with a low level of coronary heart disease. Levels over 240 milligrams double the risk. Twenty percent to 25 percent of Americans have cholesterol levels in this range, the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who heads the hospital organization's screening effort, said one valuable bit of information researchers hope to gain is insight into which people respond. `` We really do n't know who will come to be screened,'' he said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnwine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Voluntary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the estimate that 400,000 people will be tested is little more than a guess. `` If 4 million show up, it may be the third or fourth day before we can get to everyone, but we will try to serve them,'' <PERSON> Arnwine </PERSON> said. The screening program was developed in association with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to assure uniformity from city to city.

<TEXT>
 Former national security aides <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and two businessmen pleaded innocent Thursday to charges they ran the Iran-Contra affair as a vast criminal conspiracy and defrauded the government of $ 17 million. One by one, the defendants were called before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> at their arraignment, and asked by courtroom clerk <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, `` How do you wish to plead?'' `` Not guilty,'' replied <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser; and <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a top assistant to <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. `` Not guilty, your honor,'' responded retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who controlled the money and procured the arms for the once-secret Iran-Contra operation. All four defendants were released on their personal recognizance and told to report weekly by telephone to a pre-trial agency. Although criminal defendants are often asked to surrender their passports, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would not impose that condition. Dressed in conservative business suits, the four men made their first appearance in court since a federal grand jury, convened by Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> 14 months ago, handed down a 23-count indictment March 16. North, retiring as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel May 1, and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rear admiral, embraced before the judge entered the crowded courtroom. The defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` by deceitfully ... organizing, directing and concealing'' a program of support for the Nicaraguan Contras rebels at a time such assistance was banned. The indictment also said the defendants `` knowingly did embezzle, steal and convert to their own use'' part of the proceeds generated by the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Although no exact figure was specified in the theft count, it was reported elsewhere in the indictment that the arms sales generated proceeds of some $ 30 million while the government was paid only $ 12.2 million for the weapons. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> set no trial date but said he would hold an early hearing to determine whether evidence gathered by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is free of taint and therefore admissible. All the defendants except <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under a grant of immunity from prosecution, preventing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from using any of that testimony. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents assigned to his staff made sure that he was n't exposed to any new stories involving the hearings or later developments. As he obtained his independent evidence, he filed it under seal with the court. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has the burden of proving that his evidence was not tainted. `` The court has an independent obligation to determine ... whether the prosecution up to this stage is or is not tainted ...'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` This ought to get resolved and get resolved quickly.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered written motions on the taint question to be filed by April 7, and set a preliminary proceeding for April 12. A full hearing would likely be held later in April, he said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> pointed out he has hired retired federal judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> to argue such motions, and said he was ready to move ahead. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told the lawyers he would not allow a civil suit arising from the Iran-Contra affair, in which <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are defendants, to interfere with the criminal case. The civil trial had been set to begin June 27. `` It will not go forward,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` A criminal case takes precedence. This case has got to take priority.'' Outside the courtroom, a crowd of demonstrators gathered to show support for the defendants. Sen. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to issue `` an immediate pardon'' of North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The defendants were met by a mob scene of reporters and supporters as they left the courthouse. As <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> stood by silently, attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> said, `` We are going to vigorously contest this case with all our strength and might.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> left through a separate door and did not get close to reporters. However, television cameramen and still photographers mobbed his gray limousine as it drove by the building. North waved and smiled from the car. Before the arraignments, some 30 supporters of the defendants chanted as <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, the last of the four to enter the building, walked through the front door. `` God bless you, sir. God bless <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>,'' shouted one demonstrator. The group chanted, `` Fund the Contras, not the lawyers'' and waved signs reading `` Investigate Communists in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` $ 10 Million Witch Hunt.'' `` We're here to support <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. I think he's a man of action and a true American citizen,'' said <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, chairman of Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said the demonstrators represented several organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> He said they wanted to `` show friendship and support for <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> and solidarity with him.''

 Former Mayor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was sentenced to 10 years in prison today for extorting $ 1.5 million in kickbacks from businessmen during his years as the city's top elected official. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 60, pleaded guilty Jan. 6 to charges of racketeering, conspiracy to obstruct a government investigation and tax evasion in connection with what federal prosecutors called one of the biggest public corruption cases ever uncovered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state.

Before <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s 10-minute speech to the judge, his attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Boreanaz </PERSON>, made an impassioned plea for leniency. <PERSON> Boreanaz </PERSON> rebutted statements made by prosecutors that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> had not fully cooperated with the government's efforts to identify and turn over his assets. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> would be eligible for parole after serving a third of his sentence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> must surrender by April 14 and would serve his sentence at a medium-security federal prison that has yet to be determined. The former mayor faced nearly seven centuries in prison after being named in a 40-count federal grand jury indictment that accused him of 65 separate acts of extortion. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> earlier surrendered to the government more than $ 1.4 million in assets the government has linked with the extortion-kickback scheme he admitted running during his four terms as <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive between 1970 and 1986. The former mayor was to have been sentenced on March 10 but questions by the government about whether <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> had withheld any assets caused <PERSON> McAvoy </PERSON> to delay sentencing until today. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> met with government attorneys for more than 20 hours and submitted to at least two polygraph tests during the past two weeks. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was indicted July 16, 1986, by a special grand jury investigating public corruption in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> initially denied the charges, but the the overwhelming and highly detailed evidence, including testimony from <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s pick-up men and other co-conspirators, caused him to seek a plea bargain.

<HEAD>Religious Activists Appeal For Ouster of Patriarch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six religious activists seeking greater religious freedom in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> called Thursday for a new Russian Orthodox Church leader to replace the ailing Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>. The activists, led by the Rev. <PERSON> Gleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON>, sent an appeal to the 78-year-old <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> asking that he step down because senility and poor health make him incapable of fulfilling his duties. The group, who met with reporters, said they have noted some encouraging changes in official tolerance of religion and believe it is time for a change at the top. They also sent their appeal to the church Synod that meets next week, <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said, in the event <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> does not choose to leave. The Synod is responsible for making church appointments. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> acknowledged that it would be unprecedented for the church hierarchy, which is subordinate to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government, to oust the church leader against his will. `` On the shoulders of the church leader rests the heavy weight of spiritual and historical responsibilities,'' the appeal reads. `` You, Your Supreme Holiness, are not up to bearing this weight.'' <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>'s office recieved the appeal, church chancery director <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsyganova </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't say whether it will be discussed by the Synod or not,'' she said. `` I rather doubt it as the Synod's business agenda has been determined for a long time.'' She said <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>, who is widely reported to be in poor health, was not available for comment. `` I doubt he will leave of his own accord,'' <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said. `` But we sent the letter with the hope that those around him who assist him in carrying out church duties will be able to influence him.'' Religious activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertny </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> rarely appears in public and his crucial role as liaison between the Russian Orthodox church and the government is filled by an unknown cast of supporters. `` He has been seen by foreign visitors to ask his deacons where he should go and what he should do,'' <PERSON> Bessmertny </PERSON> said. `` He has to be led around like a very old man.'' <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> and fellow priest <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainov </PERSON> said they were not appealing for any particular church official to succeed <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON>, who was imprisoned for six years because of religious activism in the 1970s that authorities considered to be dissident behavior, was restored to the ministry last year after 20 years of exclusion. More than 200 churches have been reopened recently for the observance of the 1,000 th anniversary of the coming of Christianity to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> Whether that trend will continue after the formal observances in June is not clear, the activists said. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> also said church activists have found it easier now to receive religious materials from foreign affiliates, including Bibles and magazines that once were deemed anti-Soviet. The appeal to <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> also noted the positive trends, although it criticized the dearth of monasteries, seminaries, churches and priests. `` Paradoxically, it is not the church but the government that is taking the initiative in drawing believers into the social mainstream,'' the appeal to <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> said. `` Society has survived a spiritual crisis and the Russian Orthodox Church can play a significant role in its recovery.'' While there have been encouraging signs of change, none of the laws instituted in 1929 to break the church's influence with the peasantry has been repealed, <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said. Those laws prohibit charitable work by churches as well as religious education, arguing that such work violates the principle of separation of church from state. The religious activists said 54,174 churches were open at the time of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and now there are about 7,000. The number of Russian Orthodox priests has declined on a similar scale.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> issued a stinging attack Thursday on anti-apartheid clergymen, saying they praise guerrillas who commit horrendous atrocities. The accusation came in a five-page letter released by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in response to a letter from the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, who defended the clergy's growing role in anti-government protest The exchange of letters is the latest round of a bitter church-state confrontation that began last month when the government banned all activities by 17 major anti-apartheid organizations. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other clegymen vowed to fill the void created by the bannings. On Feb. 29, <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and 23 other church leaders were arrested while trying to march to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with a petition protesting the crackdown. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> a week ago, defended the clergymen's decision to protest against `` ungodly acts of oppression.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in his response, described himself as a devout <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. He said his government, which denies the black majority a vote in national affairs, strove to broaden democracy and remove discriminatory laws. Referring to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and South African <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>: `` You love and praise the ANC-SACP, with its Marxist and atheistic ideology, landmines, bombs and necklaces perpetrating the most horrendous atrocities imaginable, and you embrace and participate in their call for violence, hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution. `` In the name of God,'' added <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, `` I call upon you to be messengers of the true Christian religion and not of Marxism or atheism.'' `` Necklacing'' is a form of execution in which a gasoline-soaked tire is placed around a victim's neck and set alight. In nationwide unrest from 1984 through 1986, many blacks suspected of collaborating with the government were necklaced by black militants. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign aimed at undermining white-minority rule, repudiated necklacing last year and the method has been used infrequently in recent months. At an emergency meeting Tuesday, Anglican bishops from across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> pledged support for <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in his confrontation with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The bishops said they rejected the president's efforts to depict the dispute as a choice between Marxism and the government's programs

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., thin and full of good cheer, left the hospital Thursday saying `` I feel good'' despite a setback that has delayed a second operation on an artery in his head `` I've asked you all to come today because I've decided to announce that I am re-entering the race for president,'' the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> senator joked to reporters waiting outside <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> where he had spent the last 11 days. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign last Sept. 23. He had undergone surgery to correct an aneurysm in an artery that supplies blood to the brain on Feb. 12 and was scheduled to have a second artery similarly repaired early in April. But on March 13 he re-entered the hospital for a suspected blood clot in his leg. It turned out the clot had lodged in <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s lungs, where it dissipated and was absorbed by the body To prevent more such clots, which occur frequently after medical intrusion into the artery, doctors last Friday implanted a tiny, umbrella-like filter in a large vein that conveys blood to the right atrium of the heart. The arterial surgery now probably will be the end of May. `` They do n't want me working, but do want me walking,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` The most disturbing part of the intermediate step I've had is the delay of the second operation for a month or so. The second operation should be a relatively easy piece of cake.'' He said he wo n't be back in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> until he recovers from that surgery. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> looked thin and said he is now down to a 34 inch waist. `` I probably do n't look very hot, but I feel fine,'' he said. He declined to talk politics, saying that `` if you are out of the loop more than a couple of days in this race, you are really out of the loop.'' And of the race, he said: `` I think it would be much better if I were still in it.'' The senator wore a baseball cap with the letter `` D.'' He had worn the same cap on his first hospital release and said he'd gotten mail asking why he was a <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> fan `` This is a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> baseball hat,'' he said. `` I hope this will put an end to the most serious problem I've confronted in the last six weeks. And, added the senator, who is nearly bald, `` the reason for the hat is that they kind of took some of my hair off and I did n't have a lot of hair to begin with.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> has handled hazardous waste materials in a sloppy and potentially dangerous way, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> reports. The DER told the company it would be fined $ 174,399 unless it can show that the violations are not as serious as the state agency contends. `` It looks as if they -LRB- Disney supervisors -RRB- do not have good control of their hazardous waste,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gionis </PERSON>, enforcement section manager for <ORGANIZATION> DER </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> district. A two-day inspection of the 43-square-mile tourist attraction in January found nine violations, seven classified as major. The DER wants the company to test for possible groundwater contamination in two of the nine areas inspected. Disney spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said Thursday the company had `` always tried to comply with DER regulations, and we will make whatever improvements are deemed necessary.'' The inspection was conducted after the DER received an anonymous complaint. Much of the criticism involved a maintenance yard in the Epcot Center section, where toxic paints, solvents, pesticides and other chemicals are stored. The DER described the maintenance yard as an `` uncontrolled, unsupervised, unmanaged and unposted site.'' State inspectors said they found steel drums stored indiscriminately and filled with waste and unknown chemicals. Many drums were unlabeled, rusty, open or lying on their sides, with their contents running off a concrete slab where they could contaminate groundwater. There were no precautions to guard against fires, explosions or spills, the inspectors said. Such dangers, plus a possible contamination of groundwater, `` could threaten human health or the environment,'' according to the report. Inspectors found only one employee that had received training in handling the materials, and the DER asked that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> set up a training course on hazardous-waste management. The park passed similar inspections in 1984 and 1985. No inspections were made in 1986 or 1987. In 1981 and 1983, it was cited for minor violations. Disney officials have 10 days to meet with the regulatory agency to set up a plan for correcting violations and negotiate penalties. It could take months or even years to make some of the changes requested, <PERSON> Gionis </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Fifth Crack House Set Ablaze</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fire officials on Thursday investigated a blaze at an abandoned house used by crack cocaine addicts, the fifth such fire which officials said may be the work of anti-drug vigilantes. `` I do n't have a gut feeling whether it's the same person,'' said fire Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. `` It could be one person or four different people. I do know that whoever it is is not serving the community.'' As in the other cases, police found little evidence to aid their investigation of the fire which broke out Tuesday in a working-class neighborhood, according to fire spokeswoman <PERSON> Cristy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>. Investigators believe the blaze may be related to fires that gutted three houses March 17 and another house two weeks ago near <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said Thursday. One firefighter suffered a heart attack during one of the fires last week and is still hospitalized, she said. Six other firefighters and one civilian have also sustained minor injuries. The latest fire was confined to a small area of a vacant two-story house and appeared to involve a flammable liquid. No injuries were reported. Although not in the same neighborhoods, the fires have all involved vacant buildings that were hangouts for vagrants and crack users, and all involved a flammable liquid, fire officials said. `` People seem to know where they are,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said of the crack houses. `` Police know where they are, too. They try their best but as soon as they close someone down, someone else moves in.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is concerned that more people could get hurt, or even killed, and that copycats may prompt more fires, especially since avenging arsonists are gaining prominence around the country. Two men who recently set fire to a crack house in their <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> neighborhood were featured on three national news magazines and a national morning television show. `` I resent all this attention they're getting,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more you make heroes out of these guys the more problems we're going to have. Everybody wants to be a hero.''

<TEXT>
 Representatives of the recreation and small aircraft industries and other insurance users claimed Thursday that insurance costs have skyrocketed in the past four years because of problems with the legal system, not because of insurance company conspiracy. The groups stopped short of directly criticizing lawsuits filed Tuesday by eight states that accused dozens of insurance companies of conspiring to curtail insurance coverage. Instead, the groups told reporters that the suits, filed in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, served to draw attention from what they believe is the main problem: high damage awards by the courts and frivolous suits. `` We would love to find a simple solution to this,'' said <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, having lived with this crisis for the last four years, we've concluded there are many factors involved. `` We do n't believe this is an issue of insurance companies colluding,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> continued. `` If that were the case, why ca n't some recreation companies find insurance at any cost? <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, echoed <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>'s contentions. `` Many of our companies are now self-insured or self-insured for the first $ 50 million or $ 100 million,'' <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON> said. `` So, our problem is not an insurance problem, but what's going on in our courthouses and legal system.'' He presented figures showing that the number of fatal accidents involving small planes decreasing in the past decade, while the amount of paid claims rose significantly. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronenberg </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which manages insurance programs for companies involved in storing, cleaning up and disposing hazardous wastes, agreed that the court system is to blame. <PERSON> Kronenberg </PERSON> said `` It is clear that many of the insurance companies did not have an adequate understanding of the pollution industry'' when they originally wrote policies and then sharply increased rates or stopped writing insurance when they realized their risks. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which says it represents more than 400 trade associations, businesses and professional groups, said his group has been pushing for several pieces of legislation at the state level, among them one that would give judges more power to impose sanctions on lawyers who bring frivolous lawsuits.

 The White House said today that the upcoming summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be `` quite productive'' even though the two sides are separated by a wide range of major differences. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had scheduled his fourth summit with the Soviet leader merely as a wrap-up to the president's second term. The May 29-June 2 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit `` will be well prepared; there will be substance to discuss; there will be good prospects for success,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. He added that `` there will be a number of important and substantive and meaningful issues to be resolved and all of those things will occur at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. It meets all the criteria that needs to be met.'' If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators can unravel disagreements over the next nine weeks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will sign a sweeping pact to cut long-range nuclear weapons arsenals. `` I think this summit will be quite productive, well defined, well prepared,'' the spokesman said without citing any specific areas of agreement. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was queried about summit prospects amid indications from both Secretary of States <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet foreign minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Wednesday that little agreement was found on an array of troublesome issues. Prior to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first summit sessions with the Soviet leader, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had repeatedly insisted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> unless substantive progress on matters such as arms control could be achieved. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the success of the Shultz-Shevardnadze sessions this week lies in the fact that both sides had `` faced all the tough problems'' and that there is no confusion about where both sides stand. `` We made enough progress to keep going and presumably we will make more in the days ahead,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also announced that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had accepted an invitation from the Finnish government to travel to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> from May 26 to May 29, prior to the summit. Afterward, he will stop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on the way home. The president will deliver an address while in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> and might deliver another in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the spokesman said, but he gave no other details. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in a meeting with reporters Wednesday evening, was asked about chances for reaching an arms control agreement in time for it to be signed at the summit. `` I would n't want to lay you odds,'' he responded. The road to the summit is also littered with divisions on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and above all, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where plans by the Soviets to end their 8-year intervention have hit a snag. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been talking about going to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the autumn of 1985 when he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for their first meeting. Not since President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1974 and President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> later that year has an American chief of state traveled to the land <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once called `` an evil empire.'' The summit's proposed highlight would be the signing of a treaty to scrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers' long-range bombers, missiles and submarines. But major differences remain, despite pronouncements that progress was made during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s three days of talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Asked if a treaty would be ready in time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I have no way of answering that.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called it `` a possibility.'' The envisioned treaty would set a ceiling of 6,000 warheads on long-range missiles and bombers, but the two sides must still set sub-limits on the various types of weapons and decide how to verify compliance with a pact. The compliance issue is especially thorny because the weapons are among the hardest to detect in the superpower arsenals: sea-launched cruise missiles, ballistic missiles on submarines and cruise missiles launched from bombers. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said progress has been made on verification, but `` much more work needs to be done,'' at the continuing round of talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and at two more Shultz-Shevardnadze sessions, first in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> April 21-25 and then in the middle of May at an unspecified site. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> portrayed their governments as working with a common purpose to fit pieces of the arms control puzzle in time for the summit. They made no effort to hide their sharp disagreements over regional issues like <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets rejected <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal for a freeze in supply of military aid to the Afghan government during a withdrawal of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 115,000 troops and for three months afterward. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stop aiding the Afghan resistance during the same period. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> adamantly rejected the offer, telling reporters the Soviet backing for the Afghan government was codified in a treaty and `` we are not going to rescind that treaty.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has pledged to withdraw the troops, which went into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, but lack of agreement on aid cutoffs has complicated the process. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the Soviets were willing to withdraw forces by the end of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during the first three months. But unless the Soviets stop aiding the Marxist government at the same time as it withdraws, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will remain unstable, he said. The two foreign ministers also apparently hit a dead end in talks about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to stop supplying weapons to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop doing the same for other Central American nations before the Soviets will stop helping <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said.

 Scientists have used lasers to identify organic chemicals in meteorites, and say the new technique may revolutionize analysis of certain pollutants, oil-bearing rocks and other chemicals. The procedure is much faster than standard chemical tests, requires only a tiny sample and does n't destroy the material, said a statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION>. The technique was developed by chemist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zare </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Its use to identify organic compounds in six meteorites was outlined in a study, published in Friday's issue of the journal Science, by <PERSON> Zare </PERSON> and his colleagues at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> and by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bada </PERSON>, a marine chemist at <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, located in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>. `` The problem with standard chemical techniques for doing organic analyses of meteorites and other rare materials is that they are laborious, destroy the sample and require one to 10 grams of the material to be tested,'' <PERSON> Bada </PERSON> said. A gram is about one-30th of an ounce. `` Our method can reduce the analysis time from a month or more to just a few minutes, and we need only one millionth of a gram to do the test,'' he said. `` In addition, the technique does not require the use of solvents that can contaminate the sample, and is non-destructive to the sample.'' The new method may be used widely to analyze meteorites, cosmic dust, environmental pollutants and oil-bearing sediments, the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> statement said, adding that the technique `` may revolutionize the way certain chemical compounds are analyzed.'' The study found wide variation in the content and relative amounts of organic substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, in the meteorites that were tested. Scientists believe meteorites are remnants of the young solar system, and analyzing their contents may provide clues as to why life arose on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> but not elsewhere in the solar system. The researchers placed tiny amounts of meteorite samples on a Teflon-coated probe, then inserted the probe into a vacuum chamber. Each sample was hit with a 10-millionth-of-a-second burst from a carbon dioxide laser, which heated the samples to about 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat released molecules of the samples into the vacuum chamber, where they then were struck by an ultraviolet laser beam. That electrically charged the organic compunds in the meteorites so the chemicals could be separated and identified by matching their masses with masses of known substances.

 A supertanker put out a distress signal in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today and appeared to be the victim of an Iranian attack, but the captain denied it had been hit, maritime salvage executives said. The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 267,589-ton Friendship L reported in a radio contact that its engine room was on fire. The captain did not say what caused the fire. In a later contact, the captain denied his vessel had been the target of an Iranian raid. The Iranians have launched nine attacks on neutral shipping in the southern gulf since Friday. The ship attacks are part of the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iraq-Iran conflict About 500 ships have been attacked by both sides, according to the London-basec <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors worldwide navigation. Salvage tugboats rushed to the Friendship L, which gave its location between the southern gulf emirates of <LOCATION> Ajman </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khaimah </PERSON>, close to the <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormuz </ORGANIZATION>, said the executives. The strait is the sole entry to the gulf. There was no immediate word on the extent of damage. The executives said the vessel in distress was in almost the same area where a Cypriot freighter, the Odysseas H, was attacked by two Iranian gunboats on Wednesday. Eight other attacks on freighters and tankers of different nationalities were hit by the Iranians in the past week, all in the same vicinity. Salvage tugboats were still struggling to contain a blaze in the crew quarters of the Odysseas H, 24 hours after the attack. No casualties were reported on board. Strong winds were whipping up the flames and impeding the salvage operation, the executives said. Reports indicated the vessel was being steered in the direction of Omani waters for shelter where the salvage operation would be completed.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to end production of chlorofluorocarbon compounds, the most potent destroyers of the earth's ozone shield, the company said today. But the company's chairman, in a letter to several senators, did not say when the production would cease. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> told Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., that the company decided on `` an orderly transition to the total phaseout'' of the compounds following a report last week that they probably were responsible for a 2.3 percent decline in the thickness of the earth's ozone shield from 1969 to 1986 The ozone shield, generally 15 to 25 miles high, blocks harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun that can cause skin cancer. The compounds are used for refrigeration fluids, plastic foam blowing agents and cleaning solvents, and aerosol propellants outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended aerosol use in 1978, which caused worldwide production to dip, but production resumed its upward climb in the early 1980s. In 1985, the nations of the world produced 2.28 billion pounds, about 30 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The report, by a panel of scientists assembled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, constitutes `` important new information'' justifying <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s reversal of its previous position that an end to <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production was not justified, <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> said. The letter was made available by <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>'s office. Similar letters were given to Sens. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. `` It's a very responsible <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> must now press their industry colleagues'' for similar action, <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said in a statement. The three senators challenged <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> on Feb. 22 to live up to the company's mid-1970s pledge that it would end production of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds if a threat to health were demonstrated. <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> wrote back on March 4 repeating the pledge but adding, `` At the moment, scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> emission reductions.'' Today's letter said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> was encouraging other producers to `` join us in pursuit of this goal,'' and would `` urge all nations to treat this new scientific information seriously.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> moved 250 more military police into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this week, more than doubling the number of security personnal assigned to the strife-torn country since March 14, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the latest deployments brought to 670 the total of extra security personnel airlifted to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` and that's it.'' `` At least, that's it for the interim,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` This was part of a general, supplemental deployment of military policemen, and that supplemental deployment has now come to an end. So I do n't expect it to go any higher. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, had about 600 security personnel assigned to it before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stepped up its campaign earlier this month to oust strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The new deployments thus more than double the number of security personnel in the country. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, asked why the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> thought it needed to airlift additional personnel when there were already 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen in the country, said the concern was having sufficient `` people who are trained as military policemen. ... They're trained to handle riot control and all sorts of things. And this has to do with the physical security of our military installations, housing areas and the like due to civil unrest and potential for civil unrest in the country.'' Capt. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLuntas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Thursday the latest group of approximately 250 MPs had been drawn from the <ORGANIZATION> 503rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced it had dispatched about 212 soldiers from that unit to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, at the time bringing the `` security augmentation'' to 420. Although no moves have been reported against American servicemen or their dependents, defense officials are said to be concerned that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might lash back at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by attacking or sabotaging facilities there.

 The prosecution rested its case today in the second of three impeachment allegations against Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> being tried before the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. After the prosecution called its last witness, presiding officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> denied a defense motion to dismiss the charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> misused $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The defense called as its first witness <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagadorn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice president who said he had loaned money to members of the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> family for decades and none had ever defaulted. Earlier today, Sen. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the allegation that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> loaned public money to his auto dealership is serious and could have been the subject of a criminal investigation. West spoke as former state Attorney General <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> testified that he believed the $ 80,000 loan from the governor's protocol fund was illegal `` Your testimony, if accurate, is either a nuclear explosion or at least devastating,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. A criminal charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> misused public money would be a class 4 felony carrying a penalty of up to $ 150,000 and five years in prison, the senator said. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Colville </PERSON>, a developer and mortgage banker, testified today that there were three previous liens totaling $ 3.7 million on the <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> property, in addition to the deed of trust for the $ 80,000 loan. The property was appraised at $ 3.35 million a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Colville </ORGANIZATION> ssid. In the event of a foreclosure, the previous liens would have to be paid off before the $ 80,000 loan could be repaid, he said. However, defense lawyer <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> questioned whether the appraisal was low as part of a general industry practice. Asked by prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> if he would have made the $ 80,000 loan to <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> based on that information, <PERSON> Colville </PERSON> said, `` I would have to answer no.'' The prosecution has contended the auto dealership needed the money badly, and that the $ 80,000 loan was not simply a business deal intended to benefit the protocol fund as the defense said. <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON>, who was attorney general under the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor's predecessor, Democratic Gov <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, testified Wednesday that the loan violated several state laws. Earlier, an accountant who examined the records of the dealership said it would have been overdrawn at its bank had <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> not borrowed the $ 80,000 on July 17, also contradicting the governor's previous testimony. `` Unless these funds had been paid from the protocol fund, <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> would have had an overdraft the following Wednesday in excess of $ 60,000,'' said accountant <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers contend the protocol fund, created with fund-raising proceeds from the governor's inauguration, is private money and the loan was merely a good business deal intended to provide a higher interest rate to the fund. The prosecution, however, says the protocol fund is state money since it is intended for the purchase of ceremonial state gifts and other means of promoting <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s image. In January, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> testified before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment committee that his dealership did not need the money to pay its bills. However, <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> said his analysis of the dealership's records showed that it paid <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> $ 81,309 owed for six cars on the day it received the $ 80,000 from the protocol fund. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> suggested the dealership could have had other assets which could have been converted to cash, but <PERSON> Sorsensen </PERSON> said he had found no such assets. <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> testified that he had examined the way the protocol fund was set up and the applicable state laws and concluded it was public money, even though it was not officially turned over to the state treasury. The $ 80,000 loan violated state laws against loaning state money, failing to keep the fund intact until it was properly disbursed and transferring money when not authorized by law, <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in six decades, also has been charged with obstructing the investigation of an alleged threat and concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The first-term governor also faces an April 21 criminal trial on felony charges of concealing the campaign loan and a May 17 recall election. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in the impeachment trial.

 The winds of change are shifting fast in French fashion. Having barely coaxed women into knee-baring minis, several important designers did an about-face to long skirts in winter ready-to-wear collections. The different lengths shown over eight days give a wealth of options to women who choose to bare or hide their legs. Influential creators such as <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> are among those whose fashions still are above the knee. But saying he's tired of minis, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> showed some nearly ankle-length skirts in his own collection. His skirts for <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> were both short and long. <PERSON> Yohji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>'s somber looks were all long. But many others, including <PERSON> Rykiel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kenzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>, offered optional lengths. Trousers are back in a very big way, another boon to women who have never given them up for city wear, no matter what <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> has decreed lately. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> featured nearly all slim pants, and only a few ankle-length skirts, in his sharp collection. The `` clothes sculptor'' outlined his handsome jackets with enormous funnels or big collars turned down to eclipse the shoulder, the waist looking tiny over trumpet-shaped jacket hems. Other pants ranged from gray flannel and straight with pleats from the waist, as at <LOCATION> Scherrer </LOCATION>, Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> and Cerruti. At <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> they appeared full, as `` pant-skirts.'' At Ungaro they were slightly draped. Besides these developments, there's a big range of silhouettes, although a note of sobriety has crept in. In a competitive market characterized by a shaky and lower dollar, designers are aiming to sell to a more cautious consumer who is looking for wearability rather than gags in their clothes. Overpadded shoulders are out. Belted or boxy coats were topped with big bertha collars or wraps, which were handsome in dazzling colors at <LOCATION> Lacroix </LOCATION>. Ankle or knee-length princess or redingote styles swept down the runways, as did tent-like greatcoats, plus capes and caped shoulders. Suits came back in force, silhouettes lean and sophisticated, or full-skirted for ingenues. Jacket options were often fine for adventurous businesswomen who like to dress with style, in everything from lively boleros to sharply pointed spencers. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s stunning classics were fronted with geometric or cubist patchwork effects. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> topped his high-waisted checked suit with a cropped V-neck bolero. <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION> opted for very long jackets for his own and the <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> collection, along with good short jackets at the latter. Another easy topper is a wrapped surplice blouse or sweater. Shawl collars, shoulder wraps and fur-trimmed lapels were frequent favorite details on suits or coats. The new quiet looks featured plenty of easy lines in jersey. There were belted bicolored tunic outfits at Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, layers of flowing A-line jerseys at <LOCATION> Issey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miyake </LOCATION>. Even fashion's former `` bad boy'' <PERSON> Gaultier </PERSON> went into easily fluid clothes, leaving behind his weird padded corset-looks. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> varied his complicated, waist-cinched puff-sleeved looks with a big line of flowered babydoll flyaway dresses in light fabrics, which should please the full-figured woman. He also brought back the chemise, shaped mainly by a low knotted drape in back. Daytime fabrics featured bright windowpane plaids, gray or black and white checks, chevrons, tweeds and pinstripes. Dressier were the flowered light wool fabrics at <LOCATION> Lanvin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ungaro </ORGANIZATION>. Paisleys looked lovely in the new suits, as did tapestries or oriental-rug motifs at <LOCATION> Lacroix </LOCATION>. The fabrics bonanza also included smooth or stretch lycra jersey, cashmere, cable-knits, mohair, broadcloth or serge, lots of suede or lambskin, and curly Mongolian lamb for warm-looking coats. Daytime colors abounded in browns from beige to chocolate, all shades of gray, plus grayish pastels. Autumnal notes of burgundy, plum, grape, <LOCATION> siena </LOCATION> and ochre contrasted with the luminous colors: flame red, royal blue, emerald, tangerine and lemon. For evenings, there were sexy styles, although simpler clothes were offered along with the fancy. Body-hugging little black suits and dresses were dolled up in all sorts of ways: chandelier crystals at Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, billiard balls, silver nails or pearly hearts at <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>; sequins, lace, bows and rhinestones nearly everywhere. The <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> influence in puffs, bubbles and strapless bustier-topped mini dance dresses is still on the party circuit. Flounced taffeta or faille gowns, knee-baring in front with trains in the back are adding gala touches at Laroche and Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>. Besides ubiquitous black, the opulent late-day clothes came out in zingy shades of yellow, amethyst, green and fuschia taffeta and faille. Lots of black velvet and guipure or heavy lace starred as well, along with some shimmery flower prints. Less elaborate evening choices were some strikingly simple at-home or dinner outfits. They were great at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> in a drape-fronted ivory crepe number topped by a long cable-knit cardigan and pearls. Also elegant were Lagerfeld's velvet and satin `` Medieval'' gowns with very high waists to emphasize the decollete.

<HEAD>Dispute Flares Over Postal Cuts, Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration clashed Thursday over who is at fault for recent cuts in postal services and what future would be best for the embattled mail system. Federal budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sought to place blame for the postal cutbacks on one another _ with both sides calling the accounting process `` smoke and mirrors.'' The Postal Service curtailed some window hours and halted Sunday collections and some sorting after the federal budget reconciliation bill required it to reduce spending without increasing revenues. Postage rate hikes slated for April 3, boosting a first-class stamp price to a quarter, are unrelated to the dispute. In addition to finding fault with one another for the agency's budget crisis, disagreements flared over proposals by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and others to `` privatize'' the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by making it a private firm and opening mail delivery to business competition <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said that plan would cut costs, imoprove efficiency and probably result in better service and lower costs for consumers. But <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on postal operations that, in his opinion, all <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> wants is to destroy the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Privatization is only political jargon for `` profitization,'' <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> said, terming the idea `` the tale of an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'' Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he believes that instead of improving service, turning postal services over to private hands could well destroy the service. The prime bone of contention, however, was delegating blame for the federal budget process last December that ended with the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> being directed to cut spending as part of overall reductions in the federal budget. The Office of Management and Budget is not seeking to manage the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and did not impose the cuts, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told the congressmen. He said that the decision was made by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> themselves. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he only agreed that the cuts would reduce the federal deficit, because the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is counted in the federal budget. `` I did not advocate it,'' he said. `` Who did?'' asked <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, contending that the `` heavy hand'' of the budget office was felt at the session where decisions were made, because that office refused to approve other proposals that had been made instead of the postal cuts. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, both said they are now supporting a bill to take the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> out of the federal budget so it would not become involved in this type of problem in the future. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an independent federal agency, was not counted in the overall federal budget until 1985. `` I think the Postal Service should be placed off budget,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has long opposed the idea, told a momentarily stunned audience. Then, he added: `` By making it part of the private sector.'' `` You take a very crass and insensitive approach to things,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said, stating that he is concerned that privatization would lead to a loss of federal jobs and to the opportunities for minorities that the post office has long provided. `` Why do you think that would end if it were transferred to the private sector?'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> shot back, `` You want to break it up and sell it off and those people who are buying do not necessarily believe in affirmative action. Your administration does not believe in affirmative action.''

 Women may have a better chance of being cured of breast cancer by surgery if they undergo the operation at the right time in their menstrual cycle, a study of mice suggests. Even post-menopausal women, who get the most breast cancers, might be helped if such an effect is found and studied in humans, said researcher <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. If scientists could tailor a woman's treatment to reproduce factors responsible for higher cure rates, `` we could do that in any woman, whether she was pre - or post-menopausal,'' <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> said Breast cancer will appear in 135,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women this year and kill 42,000. Surgery can remove the tumor, but cancer cells that escaped before surgery can cause recurrence elsewhere in the body. <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> described the mouse experiment Wednesday at a science writers seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The work focused on the 5 -LCB- - day mouse estrous cycle, which corresponds to the monthly menstrual cycle in women Tumors that grow faster in response to the hormone estrogen, as many human breast tumors do, were implanted in the mice. Later analysis showed the timing of the implant in the estrous cycle made no difference in cure rates. But the timing of surgery to remove the tumors markedly influenced the likelihood that cancer would have spread to the lungs by 28 days after the operation, <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> said. Sixteen of 60 mice that underwent surgery near the fertility peak of the cycle were found to be free of lung involvement, compared with nine of 73 that had surgery during the infertile phase. That translates to 27 percent versus 12.3 percent. Under a different method to determine estrous stage, the percentages came to 31.3 percent and 14.9 percent. In human terms, the higher cure rate corresponds to surgery just before and during ovulation, with the lower rate corresponding to surgery around menstruation, <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> said. In the mice, fluctuation in the cure rate mirrored changes in activity levels of `` splenocyte natural killer'' cells, which attack cancer cells that have spread from tumors, he said. But that does not prove the cells play a role in the findings, he said. <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> said he had no detailed explanation for the results. The trauma of surgery may affect the balance between cancer and the disease-fighting immune system differently at different times in the estrous cycle, he said. He emphasized the results do not imply that cancer cells are spread from the tumor by surgery. The next step is studying hospital records for evidence of any protective pattern in past surgeries, and following the progress of women after they have breast cancer surgery at known points in the menstrual cycle, he said. `` Within a few years we may know if this is true in human beings,'' he said. `` It certainly deserves study. I think it will get it,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, clinical professor of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the evidence so far does not convince him that the stress of surgery plays a role, but that hormone levels may. `` This is a whole new look'' at appraising or altering immune sytem response to cancer, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, a past president of the cancer society. <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> also said a chemotherapy schedule tailored to the natural day-long rhythms of the body prolonged survival in 50 people with cancer that had spread from the kidney. Patients received a continuous drug infusion with the dose peaking every night. That let them tolerate twice as much drug per week than if the dose level were fixed, <PERSON> Hrushesky </PERSON> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday there are more grand jury investigations under way into price-fixing, bid-rigging and other criminal antitrust violations than at any time in this century. In a speech, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> defended the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's approach to antitrust enforcement which emphasizes price-fixing prosecutions while making it easier for mergers to occur. `` Criminal antitrust enforcement today is at an all-time high,' Rule said.

The division filed 531 criminal antitrust cases from 1890 when the Sherman Act was passed to 1949. The department has vigorously pursued bid-rigging in the roadbuilding and auction industries and other areas of business. `` Reporters do n't believe protecting consumers is news unless you block a merger between two steel companies or indict the head of one of the country's biggest corporations,'' Rule said. `` In fact, we file cases every week that have more direct impact on consumers than both of those actions together.''

 Former Mayor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a one-time leader among the nation's big-city mayors, was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison for orchestrating a $ 1.5 million extortion-kickback scheme. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 60, spent 16 years as mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest city and often was a spokesman for the nation's He has served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Pakistan Withdraws Demand For Interim Government In Afghanistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has removed a major obstacle to a settlement of the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by withdrawing its demand for formation of an interim government, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, charging <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with bad faith, had refused to complete an agreement for withdrawal of an estimated 120,000 troops from the war-torn country. Initially, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported the demand of its ally, which is negotiating terms of a settlement with the Afghan government through a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediator. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration subsequently back-pedaled _ while pressing its own demand that the Soviets cease their military aid to the Marxist government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was now willing to have the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> retreat even while the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, consulted with warring factions on formation of a transition government. `` The interim government issue, which has been an obstacle, is now swiftly soluble,'' he said. The official, who played a leading role in talks here this week with Soviet officials, briefed reporters under rules that gave him anonymity. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had contended that the safe return of millions of Afghan refugees to their homeland would not be possible under the current government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the only major remaining issue was a U.S.-Soviet dispute on military aid. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Wednesday night ruled out any agreement to end the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> unless the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suspended military aid to the pro-Moscow government. He said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had rejected the proposal, which would include a suspension in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Afghan resistance. The moratorium would be in effect during the Soviet pullout and for three additional months. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said `` it would allow the dust to settle'' without prejudice to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet claims to back rival factions. `` They did n't feel they could agree to that,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. And yet, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` those conditions are needed for us to be able to sign as a guarantor'' of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement to end the war. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters before flying home that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had no intention of stopping its aid to the Afghan government. The aid is required by a Soviet-Afghan treaty, `` those are legitimate supplies, and we are not going to rescind that treaty,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the Soviets were willing to withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by the end of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during the first three months in which the agreement was in effect. The guarantee of a withdrawal filled `` a great big hole'' in the situation, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. But, he said, Soviet military aid to the Marxist government must cease for stability to return to the war-torn country and for an estimated 5 million refugees to go home. `` The proposal remains on the table,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` If our thought or something close to it is accepted we would be pleased to sign on as a guarantor.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters on Thursday said the pullout could be carried out over 7 -LCB- months.

 Smokers reacted with irritation Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to ban smoking on all domestic routes except those to and from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` I think it stinks,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, 43, as he puffed a cigarette in a designated smoking area of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport `` I'll fly any other airline before I fly Northwest.'' A frequent business flier, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> salesman said the ban is unreasonable. `` It's hard for me to believe that cigarette smoke bothers someone 20 rows away,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, announced the ban Wednesday, becoming the first major American carrier to prohibit smoking on extended flights. Airline officials said the ban, which also applies to some foreign flights, was a response to employees' and passengers' requests, and they predicted it would attract more people than it would drive away A.B. `` Sky'' <PERSON> Magary </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for marketing, said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday said a survey found that nine out of 10 passengers prefer to sit in the no-smoking section, and that even 30 percent of the smokers supported a ban on smoking in flight. One non-smoker at the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> airport Thursday said it did n't make much difference to him. `` As long as they have a smoking section, it does n't matter,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said he travels in the non-smoking secion `` and it's never been a problem.'' Some analysts believe <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fifth largest carrier, risks losing customers. Other major airlines said they have no immediate plans to follow suit. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Joann </PERSON>, who manages an airport gift shop, said she has heard many smokers grumble about <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s action. `` They're not going to fly Northwest. They're going to do anything they can not to fly <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` When I go to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, there's no way I'm going to sit for six hours and not smoke,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Parron </PERSON>, a college student from the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Silverton </LOCATION>. `` I'd find another flight and take it.'' However, one non-smoker at the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> airport said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s move will make her more likely to choose it over other airlines. `` Those airplane cabins are too small. Even with smoking only in the back rows, smoke still bothers me,'' said <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weglicki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` It would make a difference to me in choosing an airline. It's a pretty brave move on their part.'' Under new federal regulations going into effect April 23, smoking will be banned on all domestic flights of less than two hours. Violators will face civil fines of as much as $ 1,000. Northwest's policy will take effect the same day. Some smokers said they can live with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s policy. `` It's probably a good idea,'' <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> real estate broker, told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can get by without smoking.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 93-2 today to allow Republicans to continue delaying action on a bill requiring the government to warn workers about carcinogens and other job hazards. The vote against shutting off a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> filibuster allows members of both parties to start offering amendments to a weakened version of the measure that was substituted Wednesday night in an effort to win more support for it. Only Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> voted to stop the filibuster. `` Once this vote is disposed of, the bill is open to amendments,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the bill's chief author, said today. `` There is nothing unseemly about making changes in a bill on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' However, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the leader of the filibuster, called the new, weaker version a `` fire sale'' to special interests made for `` the perception of a political victory.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, after refusing Wednesday to allow Democratic amendments to weaken the bill, indicated he is prepared to continue his filibuster. `` We intend to talk a little more at length to explain the problems with this bill,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said today. `` You ca n't do it in a few hours.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, substituted the weaker version at <ORGANIZATION> Metzenbaum </ORGANIZATION>'s request in response to <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s filibuster The legislation is aimed at what the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> says are the one in every four Americans who have been exposed to carcinogens or other hazardous substances on the job. The `` High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act'' would establish a seven-member panel of scientists to determine the biggest hazards in workplaces and identify what groups of workers are most at risk. The government would then have to notify between 100,000 and 300,000 of those workers individually each year, and their employers would have to provide them with annual medical monitoring tests costing up to $ 250 each. A similar bill was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 225-186, largely party-line vote last October despite vehement opposition from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, voicing the objections of hundreds of business groups, said the bill could open up employers to billions of dollars in liability damages from suits by their workers and former workers placed in the at-risk groups. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> could muster only 33 votes Wednesday to cut off <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s filibuster, while 59 senators, including 16 Democrats, said they wanted the filibuster to continue. `` They found out that this bill is going nowhere except to the elephant graveyard of legislation,'' said acting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s substitute a `` sweeten-the-pot theory of legislating that I find a little disturbing.'' The new version exempts both companies with fewer than 50 workers and farms from having to continue paying wages and benefits for up to a year to workers ordered off the job because of the danger that might be raised by continued exposure to hazardous substances. It also puts restrictions on what information from the program could be used by workers and former workers in pursuing liability suits against employers. Democrats admitted that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s parliamentary maneuver, although allowed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, could be used to thwart Republicans from offering amendments of their own. But they maintained that was not the intent. `` I do n't think it's fair,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The parliamentary landscape has We've seen now how senators can be shut out from offering amendments circumstantially with no malice intended.

 Soldiers shot two Palestinians dead in street battles Thursday after a night of Israeli raids in which Arabs were arrested and taken to schools converted into detention centers. Seven Arabs were wounded in confrontations in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including a 12-year-old girl shot in the left leg in <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION>, a village 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, hospital officials reported. Thursday's deaths brought to 109 the number of Palestinians killed since the Arab rebellion began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Monsignor <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, canceled the traditional Palm Sunday procession from the biblical Mount of Olives to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because of continuing violence. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, the hawkish former general who now is industry and trade minister, said Palestinians involved in the rebellion might be expelled from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the territories it has occupied since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes raided <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> for the second straight day. It was the third Israeli air raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a week and the fifth this year. Soldiers have rounded up at least 700 Palestinians in the past week in nightly sweeps through villages and refugee camps aimed at removing leaders of the rebellion, and about 3,000 since the rebellion began. Among those detained Wednesday night and early Thursday were several men believed responsible for the latest <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leaflet, said <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON>, spokesman for the Police Ministry. He would not identify them or say how many were arrested. An Islamic official in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> said about 200 imams _ Moslem religious leaders _ had been arrested in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city this week. He said, on condition of anonymity, that most were members of a fundamentalist group. Many of those arrested were taken to half a dozen Arab schools the army converted into temporary detention centers, according to <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Melham </PERSON>, a Palestinian detained Sunday night in <ORGANIZATION> Halhoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. <PERSON> Melham </PERSON>, a 45-year-old pharmacist, said he was held at the school with 12 other villagers from <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION>, 2 miles north of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, after a midnight roundup. `` Six soldiers and three intelligence officers came to my house. They handcuffed and blindfolded me, then they took me to the school,'' he said. `` We were held in a large, open room. It was very cold. There were no blankets or mattresses.'' He said the detainees were transfered the next morning to a center near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and he was released Wednesday. Three army battle tanks, two transport vehicles and two tents could be seen Thursday from a slope overlooking the high school's walled compound School desks were piled near the wall in one corner. Coils of barbed wire ran along the top of the wall and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag flew from the roof of the three-story building. Troops occupied three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> school buildings in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on Thursday and closed four in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in an apparent effort to thwart student protests ordered in a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflet. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer saw about 2,000 children streaming from the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> schools. A middle-aged Israeli officer guarding the entrance of <ORGANIZATION> Hussein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said soldiers moved into it at about dawn and would remain until sunset. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials rounded up at least 15 Palestinians overnight, bringing to more than 110 arrested there in four days, the <ORGANIZATION> Gaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Raji </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourani </PERSON>, a member of the association, said it counts only arrests reported by family members. He estimated the the true number of detentions in four days at 350. The army confirms making arrests but has refused to give numbers or details. <PERSON> Sourani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities limit visits by <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyers with their jailed clients to the hours of 8 a.m.-2 p.m. each Tuesday and require written permission from the military command. Army spokesmen said the two Palestinians were killed when soldiers fired on a crowd throwing rocks and bottles in the the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Officials at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> hospital said <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawalma </PERSON>, 21, died of four bullet wounds in the chest and heart and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zor </PERSON>, 19, was dead on arrival with a gunshot wound in the neck.

 Commissioners of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> are suing a slot machine, but only because they want to keep it around. State law forbids possession of a slot machine, but the state museum commission has an old one-armed bandit it hopes to display after the new museum opens later this year. To get around the law, the museum needs to have a judge rule that the law is inapplicable in this case. But before a judge can rule, there has to be a lawsuit. Since there was nobody available to sue, museum sued the slot machine, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general who is handling the case of <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vs. One <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>. The machine, now in the custody of the State Law Enforcement Division, is not represented by counsel. The mechanical, wood-and-steel slot machine was built about 50 years ago by <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novelty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. It was given to the museum recently by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, who discovered it under a blanket while he was preparing to sell his father's country store. `` The plaintiff is informed and believes the slot machine is of significant historical value as a reflection of the history and customs of the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said the complaint filed in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Court of Common Pleas. `` You put a nickel in and it works _ or so I'm told. I did n't try it because it's illegal,'' said <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroup </PERSON>, the museum's chief He said the machine wo n't be used for play, just display, if the museum is allowed to keep it.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the White House will be a safer place and have a better-looking sidewalk in front of it when a million-dollar-plus construction project is completed in July. The project, a compromise between security requirements of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and aesthetic standards of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, has gone through several changes since it was first proposed. The first proposal was a 42-inch-high concrete wall, with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s existing ornamental iron fence on top of it, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON>, administative officer of the arts panel. `` It would have made the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> look even more like a fortress,'' <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON> said. The commission must approve design changes affecting federal buildings and momuments in the central are of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After the terrorist attack on the Marine barracks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1983, which killed 241 American servicemen, low concrete walls called jersey barriers were erected around the White House and many other public buildings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` That was always regarded as a temporary measure,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>. After the wall was rejected, there were discussions between the arts commission and the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, with advice from the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, resulting in the present plan. It consists of 274 bollards, or thick cement and aggregate posts, each 38 inches high, placed four feet apart and joined by chains, along 832 feet of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> sidewalk. `` We, of course, would have hoped that they would be farther apart,'' <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON> said of the bollards. `` They're actually awfully close together.'' The Secret Service, however, determined that this spacing was the most effective way to stop a vehicle of a certain size, going at a certain speed, from crashing into the White House. `` We certainly agree that the first order of business would be the protection of the president at any cost, and if the aesthetic element has to be compromised, so be it, sad as that may be,'' said <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON>. `` I think the Secret Service feels that we now have a system that will do the job physically and at the same time we hope will be more acceptable to look at. It certainly, I think, will be more acceptable than the original scheme.'' <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of the White House grounds, dealt separately with the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the commission. `` You play one against the other,'' he said. `` If you work hard at it, you can usually find a solution.'' The first phase of the project is scheduled for completion in July. <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said the security work will cost $ 670,000 and the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is spending an additional $ 365,000 to replace the sidewalk with a more decorative granite walk with trees and tree boxes. A second phase is expected to be completed about the end of July, but <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said the cost has not been determined.

 The police department in this <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> community is in turmoil over allegations by lower-ranking officers that a captain took a teen-age girl along on a confidential stakeout and kissed her against her will. The alleged incident last month resulted in the demotion of Capt. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, 42, to lieutenant and has led to a state investigation and several internal investigations. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> had supervised an investigation last month on similar charges against the officer who relayed the latest allegations. The chief of the 45-member force is suspicious. `` I have n't been able to prove that it's a setup yet,'' Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Sooner or later, I'll find out. Some officers may be running scared right now.'' The officers who investigated the captain and had pictures taken of him and the 16-year-old girl deny any setup. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> declined comment. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said the problems began when <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> asked the girl, who lives with a roommate and works as a waitress, to join him on a stakeout at the local high school on Feb. 26. The girl said this week she was interested in police work but was `` half afraid'' of <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> because of his flirtatious comment that it would be cold and she might have to keep him warm. She said she told officer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> about the invitation. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> passed the girl's comment on to Sgt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Ujcic </PERSON>, who then notified his lieutenant, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. Last month, <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> was the target of an internal investigation, supervised by <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, into accusations that he was dating another teen-ager. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ujcic </PERSON> enlisted former police officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Granttham </PERSON> to take pictures when <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> picked up the girl at the restaurant. Also in the parking lot was a carload of the girl's friends, whom she had asked to follow her. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> realized he was being followed and gave them the slip, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` What disturbed me the most is that this was supposedly a confidential mission'' to catch suspected burglars, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said. `` This special operation was no longer a special operation. Everybody and their brother knew about it.'' The chief is n't happy that his nightshift officers started investigating a fellow officer on their own. He is investigating <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s role. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s family has befriended the teen-ager, and she has complained to the state attorney's office that two officers pressured her to withdraw her complaint about <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>. The chief is angry that the officers got civilians involved _ <PERSON> Granttham </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> family. `` I do n't need their help,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` I can take care of my own shop. I will take them to court if they slander my name.'' State Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, `` We're looking at a matter involving the police up there. We're taking statements from witnesses.''

 <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said today it filed a protest with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over an alleged incursion by Sandinista soldiers in the same spot where Nicaraguan troops fought Contra rebels last week. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> denied its troops crossed the border. A Foreign Ministry communique said a total of nearly 460 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> crossed the border late Tuesday. An `` energetic protest'' was filed with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over the incident, it said. It said 300 heavily armed <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> entered about 8 p.m. Tuesday in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> province, where Sandinistas chased Contras back across the border last week. It is about 150 miles east of this capital city. At the same time, 50 Nicaraguan soldiers entered at the village of <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espanol </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> province. The village is about two miles from the Nicaraguan border. The statement, read to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone, did not say if there were any confrontations in the areas or whether the troops were still believed to be inside the country. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman was asked about the report. `` That's negative,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Honduran military official had reported the new incursion on Wednesday. `` We do n't know the purpose of this new entry and violation of our country, but the situation is being studied by the high command,'' the official said. `` It's a matter of small armed groups of Sandinistas. Because of that, the state of alert continues for all combat units of the armed forces,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The location was given as the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> province, but no other details were available. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a government source speaking on condition of anonymity, said there had been unconfirmed reports that an estimated 300 Sandinista soldiers had entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The reported incursion did not affect peace talks then under way between top Sandinista and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, even though both sides said their forces would stop fighting during the talks. Late Wednesday, the talks produced an accord calling for a 60-day cease-fire beginning April 1. Earlier Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had said that unless the military situation in Honduran changes, the approximately 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week would return home early next week. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were ordered to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as a show of force after 2,000 Sandinsta soldiers allegedly chased Contra rebels from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

The groups said the same tests are being used to determine whether a youngster is admitted to kindergarten or advised to spend another year in preschool. `` Our children are being tested too early and failed too soon, and parents should ask for what purpose,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON>, accreditation director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>. Her group was joined by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Early </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Childhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> calling for an end to mass standardized testing of children before the third grade. They said they did not object to testing of individual children whose teachers or parents suspect they have a learning or developmental problem. But for most children, they said, `` Parents should trust their own instincts and the observations of trained and experienced preschool and kindergarten teachers.'' Leaders of the groups said at a news conference they do not know how many schools are resorting to standardized placement or promotion tests for 4 -, 5-and 6-year-olds But <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON> said that in some areas, `` it is not unusual now for 20 percent or more of young children to be advised to wait a year before entering kindergarten, or to ` flunk' kindergarten, or to be assigned to a special track called ` readiness,' ` transitional' or ` developmental' kindergarten.'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> recently became the first state to require standardized testing of kindergarten children. The city of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> began testing kindergarteners in 1984 on basic math and reading skills, and has been holding back 10 percent of the children, most of them minorities. But last September the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> legislature voted to discontinue mandatory standardized tests for first and second graders. <PERSON> Asa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> child psychologist and professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the tests are being used to hold children back or track them into remedial programs or special education, despite a lack of evidence that such steps improve their schooling. He said the tests have `` a disproportionate impact on those children who need school the most, the minority children.'' <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON> said testing `` narrows and misdirects the curriculum.'' `` The most important things to learn in kindergarten, such as self-esteem, social competence, confidence, self-discipline, desire to learn, can not be measured on standardized tests,'' she said. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Gesell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which produces a widely used screening test, said it was `` discouraging that these groups have taken this political position.'' `` Our position is that if there are 25 children in a classroom, all acting at 5-year-old maturity level, the teacher still has to individualize the curriculum to different ability levels. But if you put children together at different maturity and ability levels, then you have differences you ca n't possibly span,'' she said in a telephone interview from the institute's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, headquarters. <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON> said the testing issue `` is part of the bigger issue of pushing academic subjects at too early an age.'' The association's president is child psychologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkind </PERSON>, author of `` The Hurried Child'' and the leading critic of that trend. The association has 60,000 members, including teachers and others involved in preschool, kindergarten and early elementary education.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, who served a prison term for an Abscam conviction, says he plans to challenge Democrat <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> for his old seat from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 6th District. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> district leader from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, announced his candidacy Thursday for the congressional seat held by Republican <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. `` I feel there are three urgent and pressing problems and they have n't been addressed,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, 28, said, citing homelessness, drug abuse and drug trafficking, and the overcrowding of hospitals sparked by the AIDS epidemic. `` They have n't been effectively dealt with everywhere in our area or in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. We really need aggressive leadership and that's what I'm offering in my campaign. I think we need a congressman who will really go down and fight in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and get dollars in this area.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 58, has represented the 15th Congressional District since 1978. He has not made a formal announcement for re-election, but his staff said he will. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, who lost his seat in 1980 after being convicted in the Abscam scandal, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Wednesday that he expects to make a formal announcement of his candidacy early next month. <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> declined comment on <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s possible candidacy. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, 51, acknowledged he would be an underdog in a Democratic primary against <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, a 41-year-old clothing store operator elected in 1982. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> was convicted in October 1980 of conspiracy and accepting a $ 50,000 bribe from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as an Arab sheik. On probation after 13 months in federal prison, <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> is a disbarred lawyer and reformed alcoholic. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> said he expects a federal judge to lift his probation before the June 14 primary. His felony conviction apparently does not prohibit Jenrette from running for office or taking a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, although he is barred from voting in elections. According to a 1965 opinion by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> attorney general, a candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> does not have to be a qualified elector of the state in order to be seated.

 Smarting from an argument with his mother, 10-year-old <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rascon </PERSON> and his 7-year-old sister headed for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the family car after everyone else was asleep, police report.

<HEAD>Bed Shortage Related to Drug Epidemic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After closing hospital beds in recent years, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> faces a crisis because it did n't foresee the virulence and consequences of the narcotics epidemic, according to a study released Thursday. From 1985 to 1987, time in hospitals increased for drug users and for victims of the side effects of narcotics use _ AIDS patients and babies born too puny to go home. Psychiatric admissions not related to drugs also increased, but all other categories of patient care followed the predicted downward trend. `` Had it not been for the growth in psychiatry, substance abuse, AIDS and neonatal services, inpatient hospital use in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would actually have fallen roughly 5 percent between July 1985 and July 1987, as was expected by planners and regulators who oversaw the closure of 1,800 hospital beds citywide during that period,'' the survey preparers said in a statement. They described the hospitals knotted in a `` medical gridlock'' in which `` literally hundreds of patients needing acute care services spend each night in emergency rooms because no beds are available on inpatient services.'' `` Various forms of social pathology visible, but inadequately addressed, in many parts of the community are coming home to roost within the city's health care facilities,'' the study said. The study, prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bigel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was based on data from 69 of the city's 81 municipal and voluntary hospitals. It covered about 89 percent of the approximately 35,000 certified hospital beds in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Medical authorities are divided on what must be done, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s position is we need another 1,500 to 2,000 beds in this city fast,'' said <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>. Others, including Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, the state health commissioner, and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, dean of social policy graduate studies at <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION>, suggest a mix of community-based services, nursing care and special housing. During 1985-87, hospital stays grew by 44 percent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients, 15 percent each for psychiatric and substance abuse patients and 14 percent for newborns, the study found. The increases have been concentrated in low-income communities, another indicator that the hospital occupancy crisis is grounded in what <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON> called the `` general socio-economic disintegration of parts of the city.'' <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON> said crack, a form of cocaine, accounted for a large part of the problem. In addition to admissions traceable to crack-induced psychosis, `` there's a lot of crack-related respiratory illness _ people literally burn out their lungs smoking crack,'' he said. `` Obviously, a lot of those low-birth-weight newborns are to crack-using mothers.''

 Officials fearing an explosion closed the bridge between <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> and Gulf Breeze on Thursday after two barges containing highly flammable chemical vapors slammed into a fishing pier. Liquid cyclohexane had been unloaded from the barges before the collision but the vessels, being pushed by a towboat, still contained residue and dangerous vapors, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, emergency response coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it were to explode I suspect it would be a catastrophic explosion,'' <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said. Sparks from an autombile ignition or removal efforts might be enough to set off the vapors if they should leak, he said. One of the two barges was removed about two hours after the collision about 9 a.m., but the other remained wedged into the tip of the 1.5-mile-long Pensacola Fishing Pier. The pier is part of an old bridge about 75 feet from and parallel to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 98 bridge that spans the three miles across <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in the western end of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. The pier also was evacuated. The bridge was expected to remain closed for at least four hours, and motorists faced a detour of about 50 miles. <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administrator <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> ordered the bridge closed but he permitted emergency vehicles to cross. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also ordered all boats to stay clear. Authorities were waiting for representatives of Capitol Towing, owner of the barges, to arrive from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> before making any decision on removing the barge. The vapors also could cause asphyxiation, <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said. The chemical, composed in part of benzine, is used by <ORGANIZATION> Monstano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> to make nylon for carpeting, tires and other things. Experts from <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> also were on the scene. Weather was clear but seas were choppy and winds were gusting from the southwest at up to 20 miles per hour when the collision occurred. `` The wind caught it and blew him into the bridge -LRB- pier -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, risk manager for <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which owns the pier. `` It destroyed the end of the pier, a turnaround.'' Only three anglers were at the end of the pier, and there were no injuries.

 Less than two weeks before <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> goes on trial on rape and murder charges, lawyers are haggling over rights to the story that began with the discovery of three half-naked women chained in a basement. A year ago Friday, police found the women, as well as the limbs of a fourth woman in a freezer and then the naked body of a fifth woman in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> forest. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s trial begins April 4, but on Wednesday in federal bankruptcy court, attorneys for <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s creditors proposed an agreement that would assign movie, book and entertainment rights to the estates of <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> and his defunct church, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the Ministers of God. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> and the church are in bankruptcy. In the agreement, <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, would get one-third of any book and movie profits. The rest would go to <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s estate for payment to the alleged victims. But Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumberg </PERSON> argued that state law provides that 100 percent of such profits go to victims of crimes. `` If anything in the book contains any thoughts, feelings, impressions of Mr. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, that belongs to the victims,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brumberg </PERSON> said. `` If I bring in money to enhance the estates, I get one-third of what I enhance,'' <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said. `` The estates would get two-thirds.''

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was defiant today in the face of a nationwide general strike aimed at his ouster and said his opponents ca n't overthrow him. As the strike moved into its fourth day with no sign of letup, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> once again lashed out at the opposition and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a speech to a group of about 500 supporters Wednesday night. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said, wants to create a Panamanian political system `` in its image and reflecting its plans to subject'' <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of misjudging the `` patriotic feelings of Panamanians'' because they `` are not made of chocolate, nor of sugar.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been trying to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into leaving the country. The general also criticized his opponents for rejecting his offer to resign in exchange for a national dialogue, saying they have neither the `` capacity to represent'' nor to defeat `` the nationalistic forces.'' An organization of 25 Latin American nations will hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the group said Wednesday. The meeting of the Latin American Economic System in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, was requested by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A prominent opposition leader, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, returned from exile to join in the fight to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the power behind the civilian government. Almost all businesses were shut down across the country again Wednesday. Lacking food and money, thousands of people lined up at soup kitchens set up by churches throughout the country. Also Wednesday, the government ordered a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat expelled, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that economics counselor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> would not leave as demanded. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it would ignore the order because it considers <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government illegitimate. It gave the same reason for rejecting an earlier attempt to expel <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In other developments Wednesday, a dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers were detained by Panamanian police, and 100 people shouted anit-Noriega slogans after a funeral for a man killed at an earlier anti-government rally. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is out of cash because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cut off the supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into exile. The general was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulino </PERSON>, an attorney active in the opposition National Civic Crusade, acknowledged that some action from within the Defense Forces may be necessary to end the monthlong crisis. `` There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that are against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' he said. `` What we do n't know is if they will act.'' Leaders of the crusade _ an alliance of 200 professional, business, labor and other groups formed in June _ suggested some officers might fear acting against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because of the fate of 11 military rebels taken into custody after an abortive coup attempt last week. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday, `` We know for certain they are being tortured.'' Defense Forces members are due to be paid at the end of the week. Opposition leaders said their loyalty to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could fade if they, like most other Panamanians, are unable to cash their checks because of the freeze on the country's deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, that he would return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today because: `` I want to share with the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people in the dramatic days of fighting for democratization of the country.'' Authorities refused to allow <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> to enter the country last month on his return from a business trip. He said he would be accompanied on an afternoon flight by legislators from Central American and European countries. About 300 people attended the funeral Wednesday of <PERSON> Alcibiades </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, 24, a private security guard shot during rioting last week. The Panamanian human rights panel said he was killed by a pro-government paramilitary squad. His death was the first in nearly a month of often violent civil unrest that began after President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 25 and was dismissed the next day. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches. `` I just wanted to taste genuine <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hamburgers,'' said <PERSON> Milica </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikolic </PERSON>, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac. People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West. It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination. The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawn crowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before it opened Thursday. Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding. `` No opening of a restaurant in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> has created such a sensation as this one today,'' one policeman said. `` I think this restaurant has no competition in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Milica </PERSON> <PERSON> Danic </PERSON>, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger. `` It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicer and it is not too expensive.'' The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> media have suggested that the success of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun `` In fact, this is a clash between the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pljeskavica </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Vesna </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, an official of <ORGANIZATION> Genex </ORGANIZATION>, a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our aim is not to destroy the <LOCATION> Pljeskavica </LOCATION> on the Yugoslav market,'' said <PERSON> Predrag </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostanic </PERSON>, managing director of the <PERSON> Genex-McDonald </PERSON>'s. `` We want to change customs of the local people used to completly different eating habits.'' He said that lounging at tables for a long time after a finished meal will draw a warning. Also, smoking is forbidden and alcohol will not be served. This contrasts sharply with the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> custom of sitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurants and chatting with friends after the meal. The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of $ 2.57, or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town. <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON> <PERSON> Seljami </PERSON>, a waiter in a small <LOCATION> Pljeskavica </LOCATION> outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonald's, suggested that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business. `` However, we will not give up the fight even if we have to lower the prices,'' said <PERSON> Seljami </PERSON>. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, an executive of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said during the opening ceremonies, `` We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Genex </ORGANIZATION> contribute $ 1 million each for the flagship restaurant. They will also share the profits equally even though it will be managed entirely by Yugoslavs. The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour. In an effort to keep a high level of services, the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail to perform. The American corporation plans to open five additional restaurants <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in the next five years.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld the convictions of two men found guilty of setting a fire at hotel fire in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> that killed 97 people. The 1st <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected arguments by <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> that the trial judge abused his discretion in sentencing them to 75 years and 99 years in prison, respectively. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, both workers at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, admitted setting the fire as part of a labor dispute with hotel management. The fire on New Year's Eve 1986 at the beachfront hotel also injured more than 140 people. In return for their guilty pleas and cooperation in the investigation, the government had recommended a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison for <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and 24 years for <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> - <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuste </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> rejected the government's recommendation, saying the crimes amounted to felony murder. The judge also noted that a third man convicted in the case was found guilty of first-degree murder. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> appealed on the grounds that the judge's remarks at sentencing were improper and that <PERSON> Fuste </PERSON> failed to consider migating factors. `` The judge's concern over the deaths that resulted from their crime indicates that he determined the sentence in reference to the particular actions'' of the two men, the appeals court said. The justices did, however, order <PERSON> Fuste </PERSON> to hold a new hearing on the <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> sentencing to determine if he relied on inaccurate statements in a pre-sentencing report. If so, the court said he should hold a new sentencing hearing.

 Israeli jets bombed Palestinian targets on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> for the second straight day Thursday, hitting a base of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s guerrilla faction. Police said nine people were killed and five wounded in the raid, the third this week near the port city 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said most of the casualties were members of <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and the group issued a statement pledging `` merciless retaliation. A police spokesman described the attack as `` very fierce.'' He said six Israeli warplanes dropped 30 bombs in six sorties within 55 minutes. Lebanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> instructed the country's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to complain to the world body about the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attacks, state radio said. But <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> did not ask for a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting on the issue, it said. The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with standing regulations, said the main target of the raid was <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s guerrilla base, but the jets also hit a position of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` The Israelis plowed the olive groves where the stricken bases are,'' he added. The bases were engulfed by smoke and dust as ambulances arrived to evacuate casualties. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s guerrillas cordoned off the bases in the villages of <LOCATION> Bekasta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Majdelyoun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salhiyeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abra </PERSON> on the southern and eastern edges of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The attacking jets dropped scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking missiles. The guerrillas fired at the roaring jets with Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns. No hits were reported. `` Let the enemy wait for coming blows of our revolutionary fighters,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We shall strike doubly in merciless retaliation.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, broke away from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1974.

His whereabouts are not known, altough recent reports said he has been shuttling between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. His group had also vowed revenge after Wednesday's strike, saying in a statement it would `` severely strike back against the zionist enemy's arrogance and barbarism ... At the right time and place.'' Wednesday's attack also targeted <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DFLP </ORGANIZATION> bases, killing seven people and wounding 15.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> decided to cut short a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after prosecutors linked his brother to a growing government corruption scandal, officials said Thursday. The prosecutor general's office said its inquiry of corruption involving the Saemaul development group may be expanded to investigate other possible wrongdoings under the Chun administration. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who has not been implicated, yielded power on Feb. 25 to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. But <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has clung to a measure of power behind the scenes. Prosecutors said Thursday that about 200 <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> and government officials had been questioned since Monday to find out if <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, former <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, and his aides amassed fortunes by embezzling the group's funds The former president was on a three-week private visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in which he met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday, but South Korean officials said Thursday he planned to leave early. The opposition parties contend the government is trying to hide the extent of corruption under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. They have called for a broader inquiry that would look into any corruption by the <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> family and supporters. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the charges as an attempt to blacken the government's reputation. But its leaders promised to investigate any official corruption. The semi-official <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON>, or `` new community,'' is a group of community leaders that has evolved into a huge organization since it was created in 1971 to promote urban development. It has launched projects from building model communities to organizing neighborhood clean-ups. But critics have said <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> worked with past authoritarian governments to organize support and dole out patronage. Prosecutors said Thursday they had uncovered more evidence that Saemaul officials embezzled millions of dollars, peddled government patronage and misappropriated property. They said they questioned government officials to find out if they aided corrruption within <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION>. Prosecutors also said the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> was suspected of diverting Saemaul funds to personal land speculation and of making money with influence peddling. Local newspapers reported the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his aides may soon be officially charged with corruption, but prosecutors declined to confirm the reports. Many in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> believe the new government is using the Saemaul investigation to discredit the former president. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who helped put <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> into power with military backing in 1980, has vowed to end authoritarian rule and has been moving to cut ties with the former president. <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> supporters have been removed from the ruling party and the former president's role as a government adviser has been reduced to a largely ceremonial function. However, members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> say <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> may also have been involved in the corruption when he served as home minister in 1982.

 A turkey chase left 71-year-old <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> stuck in the mud in her car for two days. `` Miss Curiosity'' had a wonderful time. When she was located Wednesday by frantic relatives, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> woman said she spent her time spying on wildlife, and was n't concerned about food and water. `` I was no more scared than I am right now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said from her home. `` I knew someone would find me.'' The air and ground search began after she was reported missing Monday afternoon. Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said she had been out driving, and caught site of a turkey. `` I saw that turkey going out there and I thought, ` You fool thing. If you got a nest out there, I'm going to follow you and find you,''' she said. She followed the turkey across a field, but her car got stuck in a swampy ditch. `` At night, I locked the doors and rolled up the windows and went to sleep. During the day, I looked around and thought, ` Boy I'd like to have my house up on that hill,''' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> did n't see the turkey again, but did see three deer and a bear cub. `` The moon was shining so bright that I raised my head up and there was a little old bear. He was just a baby,'' she said. While Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> communed with nature, her eight children, most of her 15 grandchildren and assorted friends and relatives formed a `` family posse'' that combed the woods around her house. `` We were driving everywhere,'' said grandson <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 21. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said his grandmother, who walks with a cane because of arthritis, is called `` Miss Curiosity'' by family members because `` she's always doing something.'' `` I hate housework and all of that stuff, but I do love to drive,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> said. `` If I had to stay in the house I think I would die.''

<HEAD>Oil Exploration Off Florida Keys Dropped for Five Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KEY LARGO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal plan to allow oil and gas exploration off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> was dropped for five years Thursday after state officials agreed to withdraw pending legal challenges. `` This is to benefit not only the environment, but the tourist industry and the people who live along the shores,'' Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said at a ceremony on a Key Largo beach. `` I think this decision is a flagship-type decision that other states will use.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> announced separately the settlement which removes about 11.1 million offshore acres from a five-year leasing plan. The preserved area goes from <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Largo </LOCATION> south around the Keys and Dry Tortugas and north to <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on the Gulf Coast. The area would extend 60 miles west of Dry Tortugas. Three months of negotiations with <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and a January snorkeling trip the men took together on the coral reefs off Key Largo cemented the agreement, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. The Republican governor denied that election year politics had any effect, but said <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> was aware of opposition from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> congressional delegation and environmental groups. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a Democrat who built a reputation as a defender of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s environment while preceeding <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in the governor's mansion, noted that 130,000 people signed petitions opposing oil drilling in the <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which has 2,200 miles of coastline. `` This is the first time that -LRB- the federal government -RRB- have ever deleted significant areas of a lease sale from a plan,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Legal challenges similar to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s have been brought by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, with little result. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> had a pragmatic explanation for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s negotiating success: `` I think most people thought it was, at best, insane to explore for oil off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>.'' Under the settlement, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> agreed to drop as early as Monday the lawsuit against the plan, and the state also will drop its challenge to leasing 41,000 acres to the seaward of a protected area planned off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. In return, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> will impose a one-year moratorium on development of any leases that should be awarded there. That Panhandle area is believed to contain gas, not oil. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has reserved his rights to object to oil development if any should be found off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year included the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> waters off the Keys _ in a five-year plan for developing the oil resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, shallow waters extending 200 miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shoreline. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study released last year concluded that the cumulative danger from drilling, leaking tankers and other sources added up to a 48 percent chance of a major oil spill along <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coast within 35 years.

<HEAD>Personal Incomes, Consumer Spending Increased in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes rose at the fastest clip in four months during February while consumer spending was propelled upward by a rebound in car sales, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal incomes advanced 0.9 percent, reflecting strong employment gains in the past few months. Spending rose 0.7 percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent January increase. Economists said the new figures provided further evidence that the economy has suffered no long-run effects from the October stock market crash. Five months ago, analysts feared that consumer worries about the future would cause them to cut back on spending and could push the country into a recession. `` For people who were worried about a major consumer retrenchment, these numbers are encouraging,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` As long as income gains hold up, people will continue to spend.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, said consumer spending will rise by about 3.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, after adjusting for inflation, a major rebound after a spending decline in the final three months of last year. He said consumer spending would be the major factor contributing to expected economic growth during the January-March quarter of around 2 percent, as measured by the gross national product. A few months ago many analysts worried that growth in the current quarter actually would be a negative figure, indicating the country was headed into a new recession. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the fear now was that consumer spending would spurt ahead at such a fast pace that production bottlenecks could occur and inflation would be rekindled. But Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said she did not consider this a danger because she believed slower income growth in the months ahead would slow the growth of spending as well. Analysts said the February gain in incomes, which followed a 0.3 percent January rise and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent October increase, reflected good employment news. The jobless rate fell to an 8 -LCB- year low of 5.7 percent during the month. The key category of wages and salaries climbed by $ 15.4 billion in February, a 0.7 percent increase which was the fastest advance since November. Disposable income, the amount left over after taxes are paid, climbed 1.1 percent in February, almost double the 0.6 percent January increase. It was the best showing since a 2.1 percent rise in October and was credited in part to tax cuts showing up as employers held back less from paychecks. The individual tax cuts were the last round of reductions scheduled under the landmark 1986 tax overhaul legislation. The 0.7 percent increase in personal consumption spending was the biggest advance since a 0.8 percent rise in December. It reflected a jump of $ 7.4 billion in sales of durable goods as consumers responded to new incentive programs for autos. Durable goods sales had fallen $ 2.4 billion in January. With incomes rising faster than spending, Americans' savings rate climbed as well, rising to 5.2 percent of after-tax income last month, the highest level since October. Purchases of non-durable goods _ items not expected to last three years _ rose $ 2 billion in February after having fallen $ 7.7 billion in January. Purchases of services, including housing costs, increased $ 12.4 billion following a $ 13.7 billion January increase. Farm incomes increased $ 8.5 billion in February after a decline of $ 8.2 billion in Janaury. The big February gain and the large January decline were both attributed to swings in government subsidy payments to farmers.

<HEAD>Agreement Could Mean Post-Contra Era</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cease-fire agreement signed by the Nicaraguan government and resistance forces appears to signify the onset of the post-Contra era in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and an entirely new political dynamic in that country. The administration was officially upbeat about the agreement but the Contras, with little prospect of receiving more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid, were forced to drop virtually all the concessions they had been seeking earlier this year. The agreement clearly falls short of the administration goal of an `` irreversible'' democratic process in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as its price for suspending aid to the Contras. Achievement of that objective is apparently dependent on Sandinista good will coupled with whatever diplomatic and economic pressures the industrialized democracies can muster to prod the Nicaraguans in that direction. In theory at least, the Nicaraguan war could be revived if upcoming talks break down. But the short-term prospect is for the dismantling of the Contras accompanied by a number of gestures by the Sandinistas, including a phased release of prisoners, permission for political exiles to return, participation of Contra representatives in a national dialogue and guarantees of free expression. All of this was agreed to in the <LOCATION> Sandinista-Contra </LOCATION> cease-fire talks this week. Still, the Contras have relatively little to show for their six-year effort, particularly when compared with their goals as recently as late January. At the time, they still were receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military supplies and were cautiously optimistic about the prospects for more aid when that issue came to a congressional vote in early February. But Contra aid foes prevailed on that vote. The Contras' settlement terms in late January called for the implementation of 17 democratic reforms during a proposed 30-day cease-fire period. They demanded gradual disarmament of both sides, the repatriation of Soviet bloc military advisers, formation of a single `` apolitical'' national army, suspension of compulsory military service and the disbanding of the Sandinista militia. These demands received no attention at all or were dismissed with no more than vague references in the communique signed Wednesday night. Assuming that the Contras are dismantled, several questions arise: Will President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> pursue with vigor the communization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, as administration hardliners fear? Will he strengthen his ties to the leftist insurgency in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>? Will he proceed with plans to acquire MiG jet fighters from the Soviets? Will he build up the Nicaraguan armed forces to 600,000, as his defense minister suggested? Will he move toward a uniquely Nicaraguan system, which is neither modeled after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> nor his democratic neighbor, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>? Or will there be a genuine national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suggests? Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> outlined in generally positive terms the administration's reaction to the cease-fire agreement, calling it an `` important step forward.'' Other officials, asking not to be identified, said they preferred not to offer their own assessments of the agreement even on an anonymous basis because to do so would undercut <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. This suggests continued skepticism within the administration about the terms the Contras agreed to and continued anger with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for letting the rebels down. Ever since the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> peace agreement was signed last Aug. 7, the administration had been steadily scaling back on its expectations in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Last fall, the administration was asking the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 270 million in Contra aid. Faced with congressional opposition, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lowered that figure to $ 36.2 million, with only 10 per cent of that earmarked for military aid. That proposal was defeated seven weeks ago and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated an end to all aid deliveries by Feb. 29. Slightly more than three weeks later, the Contras settled with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, accepting terms that they would have rejected out of hand not long ago.

 Nearly half a million 1985 cars and light trucks made by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> must be recalled because they fail to meet federal air pollution standards, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. A faulty thermal vacuum switch is part of the reason the vehicles' exhaust contains excess carbon monoxide and evaporated gasoline, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The vehicles affected by the recall are equipped with 5.0 liter -LRB- 305 cubic inches -RRB- and 5.7 liter -LRB- 350 cubic inches -RRB- engines, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. They were sold as the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Impala </ORGANIZATION>, Caprice Classic, Camaro, <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camino </ORGANIZATION>; the Pontiac Firebird, <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, Grand Prix and <LOCATION> Parisienne </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caballero </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Models sold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which are built to stricter standards, are also included. `` Earlier, we offered to recall the vehicles to replace the thermostatic vacuum switch,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` We will review the order and determine how best to respond.'' Such recall orders by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> are rare and generally indicate the agency and a manufacturer could not agree on something, such as the cause of the problem, its scope, the necessary repair, terms of the recall or something else. Most recalls are made voluntarily. Ms. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> it believed replacing the switch on the vehicles would be sufficient to bring emissions into compliance with federal standards. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, however, said its tests showed that `` replacement of the -LRB- switch -RRB- alone will not completely remedy the problem and that additional repairs may be necessary.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has 45 days either to request a public hearing to contest the order, or to submit a repair plan for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s approval before notices are mailed to owners. The company last year recalled more than a million vehicles from the 1982 and 1983 model years for similar problems.

 The savings and loan industry, drained by insolvent institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, last year recorded its worst loss since the Great Depression, the government said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said a $ 3.2 billion loss in the last three months of 1987 pushed the industry's red ink for the year to a record $ 6.8 billion. That was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous post-Depression record of $ 4.6 billion, set in 1981, when the prime lending rate soared above 20 percent. `` I hope it's the worst we'll ever see,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insitutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group. The nation's 3,147 federally insured <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls lost $ 1.8 billion in the third quarter of last year and $ 1.9 billion in the spring. They earned $ 100 million in the first three months of the year and had a modest $ 132 million profit for all of 1986. In contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that the nation's 13,700 federally insured commercial banks earned $ 3.7 billion in 1987. Still, it was their lowest profit since 1933. Despite the overall loss for the S & amp; L industry, 66 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls earned money in the fourth quarter. The $ 1.3 billion earnings of 2,089 S & amp; Ls partly offset the $ 4.5 billion losses of the remaining 1,058 institutions. For the year, the profitable two-thirds of the industry earned $ 6.6 billion, which was more than wiped out by the $ 13.4 billion deficit of the money-losing S & amp; Ls. The percentage of institutions earning a profit has declined steadily for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of 1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L losses were heavily concentrated in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, which is dependent on the ailing oil and gas industry. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> _ lost a total of $ 2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year, accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss. An unprofitable instituion is not necessarily insolvent. An S & amp; L is considered insolvent when its loans and other assets are worth less than what it owes to depositors and other creditors. The bank board said 345 S & amp; Ls were insolvent at the end of 1987 under regulatory accounting principles, 109 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> alone. There were 510 insolvent S & amp; Ls under the stricter accounting principles that will be used beginning next year. By another measure of health, return on assets, savings institutions' performance was not quite as bad as 1981 and 1982. The return was negative 0.56 percent last year, compared with negative 0.73 percent in 1981 and minus 0.65 percent in 1982. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said some of the overall industry loss in 1987 can be attributed to a decrease in the corporate tax rate. He said some S & amp; Ls decided to push profits into 1988, when the top tax rate is 34 percent, rather than take them in 1987, when the rate was 40 percent. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said he believed the industry's problems have `` plateaued out'' and that `` there is some light at the end of the tunnel'' in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> A. Regalia, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, warned that most economists believe interest rates will edge higher and said <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> real estate shows no sign of a sharp rebound. Regalia said the performance of the thrift industry this year will depend on how quickly the bank board resolves problems at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions. `` You have to be as expeditious as possible at getting them closed down. So far I think -LRB- the bank board -RRB- has recognized the problem. Now it's time to get out and do it,'' he said. Lack of money to pay depositors had forced the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures deposits to $ 100,000, to keep many insolvent S & amp; Ls open. Now that money is flowing into the fund from a $ 10.8 billion recapitalization authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August, the bank board is moving to close ailing institutions or merge them with healthier S & amp; Ls. Last month, the bank board announced a plan to spend $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> over the next several years, but it does n't anticipate announcements on specific S & amp; Ls before early April

 Former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified for three hours Thursday before a federal grand jury investigating Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s ties to a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who declined to comment during a break in the grand jury proceedings, became involved in the pipeline project in the spring and summer of 1985 through contacts with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s client, Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was accompanied to the federal courthouse by legal counsel, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who said his client is a witness in the grand jury investigation. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is investigating whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the pipeline project. In a September 1985 memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> relating <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s conversations with <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said a portion of up to $ 700 million from the pipeline would be paid to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of then-Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he does n't recall reading the reference to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> payments in the memo, which was found in the attorney general's files at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year in connection with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is presenting evidence to the grand jury in an attempt to determine whether there was a conspiracy to pay bribes to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politicians to ensure that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not bomb the pipeline passing through <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> close to the Israeli border. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> has denied making or offering bribes, and denies that there was any plan to do so. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for help on the pipeline in May 1985 and the attorney general referred him to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who then was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser. The referral resulted in a meeting in June 1985 between <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. The pipeline's backers wanted to enlist the support of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in assembling an insurance package that would protect the project in the event of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attack. On March 11 in connection with the Iran-Contra arms and money affair, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 by assuring lawmakers the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was not helping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid.

 Angry shouts erupted Thursday between 30 supporters of defendants in the Iran-Contra case and three anti-Contra protesters outside the federal courthouse. An elderly woman ripped up signs calling <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> an `` American hero'' and shouted obscenities at demonstrators for addressing her as `` old lady'' and `` communist.'' Several police officers stood a few feet away but took no action. The woman, who identified herself as <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geckter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, boasted that inside the court building where North, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> pleaded innocent to a 23-count indictment, she looked <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the eye and said: `` Do n't you smile at me, traitor.'' The pro-North demonstrators chanted, `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>'s right, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wrong,'' a slap at <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who led defeat of Contra military aid in the House `` Fund the Contras, not the lawyers,'' the group shouted as independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the prosecutor, told reporters he was pleased that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> intended to handle the case expeditiously. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who said he would not comment on the case now that it is under <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s control, was booed by the protesters as he got into his car. North emerged from a door far from the demonstrators, but his car was mobbed by supporters and scores of reporters and photographers as it passed slowly in front of the building where the crowd had gathered. North smiled and waved from the back seat but remained in the gray limousine. `` I think <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> is getting a bum rap out of all this,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridgett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who said he belonged to no political organization. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, chairman of Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said his and several other groups were represented. `` We came to show our friendship and support for <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> and our solidarity with him,'' he said. For a time during the arraignment, <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was the lone anti-Contra demonstrator. After <PERSON> North </PERSON> passed by and <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> shouted, `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s a liar,'' several pro-North demonstrators taunted him with, `` Why do n't you get a job?'' and several more caustic suggestions. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, who described himself as a long-time peace activist, shouted back, `` Our job is protesting.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> angrily left an Islamic conference Thursday after fellow Moslems decried its failure to heed cease-fire calls in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and accused it of instigating rioting in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said the withdrawal proved the `` loneliness'' of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s stance toward the Islamic world. The Iranian envoy to the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Taskhiri </PERSON>, flew out of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> at the head of his five-man delegation. `` We were not happy,'' <PERSON> Taskhiri </PERSON>, his voice quavering with anger, said in a telephone interview. He said his group boycotted meetings Wednesday night and Thursday. `` The conference is taking place only to serve the interests of a certain country,'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` Therefore, we do n't see why we should stay at this meeting.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and other Arab countries were drafting a resolution on the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> conflict to submit to foreign ministers of the 46-member conference. Sources close to the conference confirmed that the draft denounces <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s failure to heed last July's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified further, said the draft also criticizes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s purported leadership of the violence in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, and calls for future `` security measures'' to protect Moslem pilgrims. In a statement to the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government announcing its withdrawl, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> delegation specified it was unhappy with the draft `` resolution on the gulf war ... and the resolution on the holy places.'' The text of the statement was provided by one of the sources. The conference sources also said the draft of the final communique, likely to be issued by Friday, also called for: _ An immediate Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>; _ Support for the 15-week-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>; _ Guaranteed rights for Moslem minorities in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and other countries where they might suffer persecution; _ Unspecified measures against air piracy. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s withdrawal demonstrates its loneliness'' in the ranks of Moslem countries. `` They wanted to express their voice, or better, their lies, to the organization, but they did not find ears.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, whose country was the target of Iranian criticism earlier in the conference, echoed <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, saying: `` The voice of the Iranian representative is an odd voice and it represents the loneliness in which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lives.'' The Iranians attended the meeting after boycotting last year's summit of Islamic heads of state in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> accuses of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war effort <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is Persian and not Arab, sent a low-level delegation to the <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Taskhiri </PERSON> is head of the foreign relations department in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been blasting each other's cities for more than three weeks with missiles and air raids, and the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> have pushed into northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was lambasted in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> for allegedly inciting rioting last year in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in which 402 Moslems, 275 of them Iranian, were killed. Saudi authorities said the pilgrims were killed in a stampede triggered by Iranian rioters, and in subsequent violence. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed police mowed them down with machine guns. The Saudi Foreign Minister, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON>, said his country will restrict the number of pilgrims to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> this year as a `` temporary measure'' because facilities there needed to be expanded. He did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it will send 150,000 people to this year's pilgrimage The Saudis reportedly have made it clear that <PERSON> Mecca </PERSON> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, Islam's holiest shrines, can accommodate only around 1 million pilgrims at a time.

<HEAD>Gephardt Said Ready to Quit Race; Bush Riding Big Lead Into
Connecticut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has fallen on hard times since his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory 45 days ago, will quit the presidential race unless he scores an upset victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> this weekend, aides said Thursday. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, headed for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> expecting to pad his huge lead on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, `` My mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time.'' But the scramble was already on to pick up supporters who would be freed if he withdrew. `` There's no question there are some union leaders who are now supporting <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> who would find <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the most attractive of the alternatives,'' said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at an appearance in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who is in fourth place in the Democratic delegate count, just ahead of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, spoke of getting `` back in the ballgame.'' Among the Republicans, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s main rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, that her husband now has merely a `` long shot'' chance, but she added, `` He's got the grit and determination needed to keep him in the running.'' She said neither she nor her husband have discussed the possibility that one of them might be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate for the general election. `` I'm really not seeking to be on the ticket. I'm going 12 hours a day just trying to carry <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s message,'' she said Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, holding a commanding lead in the battle for Republican convention delegates, was traveling to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, saying he was taking nothing for granted in the primary there next Tuesday. However, public opinion polls give him a big lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born and where his father once served as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, just a few weeks ago the victor in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses, now lags behind <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in delegates to the national convention. He trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in public opinion polls preceding Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. He said Thursday in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, `` Rather than trying to guess all the different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think we have to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide what other steps should be taken.'' Still, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> told a radio interviewer in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, `` I think <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> has to come in first or a real strong second to remain in the race. ... If we do n't do well here, we will not be able to continue.'' The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman has only until Tuesday to file for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, and one aide, commenting only on condition he not be named, suggested that it was important for the congressman to retain that office in order to raise money. His campaign has been strapped for cash for weeks. Money was in the news for several other current and former candidates on Thursday: _ <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he was willing to release information on more than $ 1 million in loans taken out by his presidential campaign, but members of his staff who heard the senator's remarks said no such decision had been made <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s pledge to release the material came after a report in a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, newspaper that his campaign had put up the proceeds of future fund-raisers and federal matching funds as collateral for almost $ 1.5 million borrowed from banks about two weeks ago. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, now that he is no longer a presidential candidate, can use leftover 1988 campaign funds toward retiring his lingering debt of about $ 1 million from his 1984 race _ The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to grant federal matching funds to political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, even though he is standing trial on a charge relating to alleged financial irregularity in his 1984 campaign <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is running as a Democrat, although the national party has disavowed his candidacy. The Democrats, including <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, were concentrating on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which has its primary on April 5. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spent the first part of the week trading charges with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on foreign-trade policy, a major issue in a state heavily dependent on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto sales, was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but planned to spend all day Friday in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> endorsed him on Thursday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s aides said he had no campaign events scheduled Thursday, and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was to address a rally in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, working to shore up his strength in his home state.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday declared fringe presidential candidate <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> eligible for federal matching funds, even as a former aide was testifying elsewhere of being pressured to wring donations out of people for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is standing trial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> federal court on a charge relating to alleged irregularity in his 1984 campaign. While the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was certifying <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> to receive federal funds for his 1988 campaign, former aide <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> testified at the trial that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> solicitors were warned in 1984 that that falling short of daily fund-raising quotas was `` the moral equivalent of treason'' and would result in the collapse of Western civilization. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, on a 5-1 vote, said that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has fulfilled the requirements for eligibility to receive matching funds. But the commission also said special review procedures would be undertaken to evaluate each of his submissions for matching funds, in light of irregularities found in his first submission. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said the ruling was `` terrific.'' She noted the campaign had `` no problem with the conditions'' the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> imposed. In voting with the majority, Commissioner <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, `` Presidential candidates and campaigns can come in many different shapes and colors.'' `` Overall it does look like there is substantial support for a presidential campaign from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens for Mr. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>,'' he said noting that <PERSON> Larouche </PERSON> has raised more than $ 2 million from contributors. But Commissioner <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikens </PERSON> opposed the majority, saying an <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> survey of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> contributors raised `` a question of patent irregularity'' in fund raising. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s audit staff had indicated that 6 percent of 713 LaRouche contributors contacted had not intended their checks to go to his campaign. The survey was undertaken because some contributor checks had the letters `` LDC,'' presumably for <ORGANIZATION> LaRouche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, written over `` SDI'' as the payee. And some checks contained memo notations regarding AIDS or SDI _ the first referring to the disease and the second referring to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative _ suggesting the donors may not have intended to give money to a presidential campaign, but to one of those causes. <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> auditors said many people who responded to the survey `` described instances where he @ she 1. felt pressured into making a contribution, 2. made contributions believing that the contribution was for a specific purpose other than furthering <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s presidential nomination campaign, 3. made loans to the campaign, and 4. had contributed to a number of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s interests, while making all checks The auditors had recommended that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> be found ineligible for matching funds, but the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> legal staff had said `` patent irregularities indicated by the survey results do not justify an unfavorable eligibility report.'' Instead of the usual five-day approval period, a review period of 25 days will be allowed in which the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> staff will check for irregularities in the checks he submits to be matched. In addition any checks written out simply to <ORGANIZATION> LDC </ORGANIZATION>, or those with memo notations `` indicating lack of donative intent'' will not be matched, the commission said. To be certified for matching funds, a candidate must raise $ 100,000 across 20 states in individual contributions of $ 250 or less. After becoming eligible, the candidates can receive matching funds for each contribution of $ 250 or less that they raise privately. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, charged with conspiracy to obstruct a grand jury investigation into alleged credit card fraud and other irregularities in his 1984 campaign.

<HEAD>Reagan Praises `Free-Market' Trend in Rewarding Teachers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday lauded a trend toward `` free-market principles'' in education that provide incentives for teachers who achieve superior performance. Joining Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> in a visit to <ORGANIZATION> Oakton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said recent tours of this sort `` have strengthened my confidence in our country's future.'' But the president said much work still lies ahead if the nation is to bring about the sort of educational reforms called for in a 1983 government report, `` A Nation at Risk.'' The president said he expects a status report on American education, which he is to receive next month from <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, to `` tell us what things we still must do'' as well as what progress has been made. He also said that interest in teaching has increased in recent years, partly because `` we've begun to introduce free-market principles like incentivies and accountability to education.'' He praised <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in which <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> is located, for initiating a plan in which `` career ladders, performance-based pay and other initiatives help to keep good teachers in the profession.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said no improvements in the caliber of instruction or the quality of teachers will be helpful `` if a school has a drug problem.'' `` If students are using drugs, then no education reform can work,'' the president told several hundred students and teachers in the school auditorium. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made several light-hearted references to his boyhood school days, saying he was n't a particularly good student, and telling how he'd been called to the principal's office once. `` It was n't an invitation,'' he quipped. When a student asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> whether he could attend the seniors' high school graduation June 15, he smiled broadly and said he did n't know if he could make it `` Some people think I'm the most powerful man in the world,'' he said, -LRB- but -RRB- `` every day they hand me a piece of paper that tells me everything I'm going to be doing every 15 minutes.''

<HEAD>Broken Bridge Leaves Hundreds Stranded In the Florida Keys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A broken drawbridge that stranded hundreds of motorists, some holding parties and others asleep in their cars, was fixed just in time for Thursday's morning rush-hour, police said. `` There are a lot of happy people out there,'' said <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> reopened to traffic at 8:10 a.m. after several gears jammed on the bridge Wednesday and locked it in the upright position for more than 15 hours, snarling traffic for 30 miles on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1, the main highway from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Every hotel room on both sides of the drawbridge at Plantation Key was taken, and hundreds of people spent the night in their cars. Police said motorists were remarkably patient. `` There were no arrests, no wrecks, no real problems,'' <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> said. One man who suffered a mild heart attack had to be ferried across <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to an ambulance, <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> said. A crane arrived from Key West at about 1 a.m. Thursday, and two barges were brought in to aid state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> workers who fixed the bridge, said <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocheleau </PERSON>, 25, and his friend <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotval </PERSON>, 23, sat in their car at the front of the line going north. `` You just have to roll with the punches,'' said <PERSON> Rocheleau </PERSON>, who said he served with the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I got it worse in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> anyway. We'll just sit and wait.'' Some <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students on spring break had a party at the Holiday Isle hotel. `` I had 10 rooms and I rented them all in about 10 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Alfrieda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON>, night manager at the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION>. `` It's not unusual for the bridge to get stuck, but it's usually only for an hour or two. This is the worst I've ever seen it.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> set up a roadblock to turn back southbound drivers. The <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> is expected to remain closed to boat traffic for two to three weeks, restricting boat traffic to those small enough to move under the span, <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Markey Plans To Draft Market Reforms Without Administration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finance subcommittee said Wednesday he will write legislation reforming the nation's financial markets without waiting for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to resolve disputes among warring regulatory agencies `` For the investors of this country, justice delayed is justice denied,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. At a four-hour hearing of his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> sharply criticized the creation of an administration working group to coordinate recommendations on what should be done to prevent a recurrence of the Oct. 19 stock market crash. The panel, headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, has the job of trying to resolve a turf fight among the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> over regulating the various financial markets. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an order last Friday creating the panel and gave it 60 days to report back to him. His spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, warned that the issues `` may not be resolved quickly or without considerable reflection.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, however, complained that the recommendations delivered in Janaury by a presidential task force headed by former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> should have been enough for the administration to make up its mind. He complained that waiting two more months would make it increasingly difficult to pass legislation this year, adding, `` In my judgment <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must act this year.'' `` The greatest danger facing our financial system is the safe course of delay,'' he said. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> responded that his panel, which will include representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the commodities commission, is not conducting another study. `` We are anxious to create action from this, not simply more discussion,'' he said. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said his committee, with the help of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, would proceed on a `` parallel track'' without waiting for <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s group to formulate a position. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s commission called for giving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> the power to coordinate regulation of the stock, options and futures markets. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates stocks and options, also wants jurisdiction over stock futures, which currently are overseen by the commodities commission. That agency opposes jurisdictional changes, and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has rejected taking on the additional responsibility recommended by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> has called for one regulator over stocks and stock futures, but did not say which agency should get that power. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who agreed to help <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> write his bill, said he did not agree that the creation of the Gould group would unduly delay action and said he did not see why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration could not work simultaneously. Meeting with reporters after the hearing, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> moderated earlier remarks on the urgency for reform. In a line that has become much quoted, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had compared the markets to a gun and said, `` We are looking down the barrel of the same gun, and it is still loaded.'' But on Wednesday, he said, `` I did n't say anybody was going to pull the trigger.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration warmly welcomed a Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement Thursday, and some officials said it could usher in a new era of bipartisan <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymaking on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We consider this agreement to be an important step forward,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who added that the truce leaves `` no excuse'' for continued Soviet-bloc weapons shipments to the leftist <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the Nicaraguan agreement marks `` a new chapter in the unhappy history of that war-torn country'' and vowed to move ahead before Easter on a package of humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels. `` This is a bad day for the cynics,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., a leading Contra opponent `` A piece of paper has been signed by people who many thought would never be able to sit down face to face.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also said the accord, while a strong sign of new health for the regional peace process, rests heavily on promises of future moves by both sides that could prove difficult. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, getting into his limousine after speaking to high school students in suburban <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was asked whether he thought the cease-fire agreement would hold up. `` I do n't know. We're looking carefully at it,'' he replied. `` There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to balance those two off,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen processes like this start before and fail,'' he said. `` This seems like a more concrete step, and there certainly reason to be hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skepticism side of it either because we are skeptical.'' Congressional leaders and the administration began conferring on a new package of aid to the Contras on Wednesday, and more meetings were scheduled for Monday. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said a vote could come later next week and food, clothing and medicine could begin flowing to the rebels by Easter. The cease-fire agreement reached Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, calls for `` exclusively humanitarian'' aid for the rebels to be channeled through a `` neutral'' organization, presumably the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> or some similar group. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said any aid package would have to conform to that language, and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the issue said that would rule out provisions for future military aid to the rebels. But some Republicans insisted that any aid bill include provision for a quick vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on new military aid if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> fail to live up to promises made in the cease-fire agreement, including amnesty and the release of prisoners. `` I think it is important to keep in there some speeded-up mechanism for the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get together in case the peace process fails,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., a sponsor of a Contra aid package that includes such a guaranteed vote `` It's a recognition that there is still lots of skepticism, maybe even suspicion, all the way around,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` People have been at each other's throats, and that's not going to dissipate easily.'' But of such suggestions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said: `` I think it would be counterproductive to talk about it ... We do n't want to rekindle the war.'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said compromise on language about future Contra aid was possible `` We are willing to talk to the Republicans about anything, but we are not willing to set up a process that the Nicaraguans could interpret as allowing for more military aid,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` It looks like there may be a pretty good possibility of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> getting together on something the administration could buy,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` We have n't had a strong voice for American policy in Central America in five years'' because of partisan divisions over the administration's Contra policy,'' he said. `` We would finally be sending a clear message.'' `` For heaven's sake, if the Nicaraguans, who have been shooting at each other, can agree, surely Republicans and Democrats can agree,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The promises of quick action on a new aid package for the rebels contrasted sharply with the inaction of recent weeks. The issue had been stalled since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narrowly defeated a $ 30 million humanitarian aid package on March 3, and the rebels have been without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance since Feb. 29. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said lawmakers had been intentionally moving slowly on the issue since March 17, when <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders called <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office and said they were optimistic about achieving a cease-fire in the talks that began Monday and asked that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hold back on voting for new aid

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman said on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has been `` repeatedly'' reminded to stick to a pledge against building nuclear weapons, but he declined to comment on a report the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressured the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation to stop work on a plutonium processing plant. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> halted work on the secret plant, which could have processed plutonium, a key component of nuclear weapons, and shut its largest civilian research reactor at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insistence, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was not clear whether the planned installation, which could have extracted plutonium from spent reactor fuel, indicated a decision to build a bomb or just an attempt to keep open a nuclear option, according to unnamed officials quoted by newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny the report, but he acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has expressed concerns to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And his comments suggested that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did indeed use pressure to stop the Taiwanese program, the pressure worked. `` We've repeatedly conveyed the importance that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including both the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> places on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s adherence to its non-proliferation commitments, and we are confident that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> understands this,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` It is our belief that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is not engaged in activities which are inconsistent with its commitments,'' he said. He noted statements by Taiwanese leaders that they have no intention of developing nuclear weapons. Also, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has undertaken obligations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which countries agree to let international inspectors monitor programs to make sure nuclear material is not being diverted to use in weapons. `` All nuclear materials on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> are subject to safeguards applied by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We are not aware of any violation of those safeguards.'' According to officials quoted by the Times, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> learned of the project from Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> Hsien-Yi, a top-level informant at a Taiwanese research institute who left <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> a few months ago with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, deputy director of the nuclear energy research center at the military-run <ORGANIZATION> Chungshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, has been missing since January. Taiwanese newspaper reports said he might have fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with documents showing that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> planned to make nuclear weapons. His whereabouts is unknown. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the effort to build an installation capable of plutonium extraction violated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s secret commitment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it would not undertake research to develop atomic weapons, the Times reported.

<HEAD>Major Maker of Ozone-Destroying CFCs Agrees To Stop Their
Manufacture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, producer of one-quarter of the chemicals destroying the Earth's ozone shield, plans to stop making them because of new research showing decay of the ozone, the company said Thursday. The company gave no deadline for ending manufacture of the `` fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons,'' or CFCs. These non-toxic, non-flammable compounds that <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> helped develop in the 1930s are widely used as refrigeration fluids, cleaning solvents, plastic foam blowing agents and, outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as aerosol propellants. `` I do n't see it in the near term,'' not for five years, but at the end of such a period policymakers and the chemical industry should know `` how rapidly the transition can take place,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, environment manager in <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Freon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> division, said in an interview. `` Our intention is to move as smoothly as possible from these compounds into alternatives,'' <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> announced in January it had developed a substitute foam blowing agent. Also, <ORGANIZATION> Petroferm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has announced a replacement solvent for CFCs, and other chemicals are in the works at several companies. On Thursday the company began notifying customers, competitors, employees and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of its new policy. Environmentalists were quick with praise, hailing <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s `` courage'' and `` leadership. As recently as March 4, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said a proposal from three senators that the company immediately stop making CFCs was `` unwarranted and counterproductive.'' The senators _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn. _ had written <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> calling on him to redeem the company's mid-1970s pledge to end CFC production if a threat to health were shown A March 15 report of scientists convened by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> found a 2.3 percent decline in ozone at mid-latitudes between 1969 and 1986, most probably the result of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> accumlations high in the atmosphere. That is `` important new information,'' <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON> wrote members of the subcommittee on which the three senators serve. `` I hope it's clear that it's the science of last week we're responding to,'' <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>'s letter said the company believes `` the short-term risk to health and the environment from CFCs is negligible'' but `` additional actions should be taken.'' Ozone, a pollutant at ground level, at high altitudes blocks ultraviolet rays of the sun that cause skin cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that a 1 percent decrease in ozone thickness _ it would be only 3 millimeters thick if it were at sea level _ causes a 2 percent to 3 percent increase in ultraviolet and a 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin cancers. Last fall in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, major producers agreed on a treaty, now signed by 31 nations but ratified only by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, agreeing to cut <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production 20 percent in 1992 and another 30 percent in 1998. The Environmental Defense Fund has estimated that the two cuts could amount to only 35 percent instead of 50 percent if all the exemptions are used. The treaty was accelerated, many experts acknowledge, by a 1985 finding that over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, ozone declines sharply each spring _ by 50 percent last year. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> plans `` to urge all nations to treat the new scientific information seriously, accelerate ratification of the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> protocol, and then immediately initiate the protocol's assessment process to consider further global limitations,'' <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>'s letter said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, chairman of the trade group <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> for a Responsible CFC Policy, said in a statement President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should `` personally contact the heads of government'' of participating countries asking that they ratify the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> agreement. `` This is a sterling example of corporate environmental leadership that ought to be emulated worldwide,'' and shows that `` technology can solve environmental problems,'' in this case by coming up with substitutes, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudek </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. About 2.3 billion pounds of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds are made worldwide each year, with more than 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> employees producing about 25 percent from plants in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The company says it gets $ 600 million annually from <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> sales, about 2 percent of total sales revenue. <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> said that `` Over the long term, it's our goal'' that jobs making replacement compounds should offset lost <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> jobs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants are in <LOCATION> Antioch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and Deepwater, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>US Belittles Soviet Technology For Spotting Nuclear Missiles On

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> belittled Soviet technology for detecting nuclear missiles aboard ships and snubbed an invitation this week to see the process before the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. During three days of pre-summit talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> offered to let the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> participate in an experiment to test the system in April. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> hailed the system as a technological milestone in missile detection that would help the superpowers achieve their goal of a summit agreement to cut long-range nuclear arsenals. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, however, `` we're not interested'' because the system does n't detect nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles, as the Soviets claim. `` The Soviets could not explain how this experiment would tell us more than we already know,'' the official said. `` Such technology would not be effective under realistic conditions.'' It could not, for example, tell the difference between nuclear warheads and atomic propulsion systems used on many surface ships, the official said. `` Our people know a great deal about the ideas that the Soviets have advanced, and we've looked into it carefully,'' the official said. When they agreed in principle last December to hold a springtime summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said they wanted to sign an agreement to cut the numbers of long-range nuclear missiles and bombers by 30 percent to 50 percent. With little progress _ notably on the verification issues _ during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for three days this week, neither side predicted the agreement would be ready in time. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, moreover, that until the negotiators prove they can verify elimination of the various types of weapons involved, they wo n't know which ones will be covered in a treaty. Another official, noting that the two nations also disagree on such explosive issues as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and human rights warned against expecting `` easy solutions'' to U.S.-Soviet problems. The official described the most recent talks as `` grueling,'' notably in the 11 hours of discussion on the regional hot spots. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sought to dispel suggestions that the summit meeting _ in the twilight of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency _ would be a ceremonial and symbolic visit short on substantive accomplishments During <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` we made enough progress to keep going and presumably we will make more in the days ahead,'' the spokesman told reporters. During the talks this week both sides `` faced all the tough problems'' and left no confusion about where both sides stand, he said. The summit `` will be well prepared; there will be substance to discuss; there will be good prospects for success,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He added that `` there will be a number of important and substantive and meaningful issues to be resolved and all of those things will occur at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. It meets all the criteria that needs to be met.'' `` I think this summit will be quite productive, well defined, well prepared,'' the spokesman said without citing any specific areas of agreement.

<HEAD>Iowa Quietly Continues Democratic Delegate Selection Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six weeks after the precinct caucuses that put <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in the national spotlight and provided the first test of Democratic candidates' strength, Democrats here are quietly proceeding with the next step in their delegate-selection process. The conventions in the 99 counties this weekend are the second step in the complex process of choosing 52 of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s 58 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The field has shifted dramatically since Feb. 8, when the much-publicized precinct caucuses were held. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman who won the Democratic contest, has gone on to weak showings elsewhere. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> have surged to the front of the Democratic pack. Supporters who put <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on top last month probably wo n't flee his sagging candidacy for other Democratic candidates in county conventions this weekend, Democratic leaders said Wednesday <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters are making a low-key effort to lure supporters from other camps, but working hard to keep their expectations low. `` It's informal,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. `` I'm sure all of the campaigns are trying to lobby.'' At the precinct caucuses, party activists elected delegates to the county conventions, based on the proportion of support for the various presidential candidates. At the county conventions, delegates will be elected to congressional district conventions later in the spring. Despite <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s slide, <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers wo n't be making a major effort to convince his delegates to switch at the county conventions. Other activists agreed, saying backers of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished second in the precinct caucuses, will wait to see results in tests in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> before making a decision. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is considered a last-ditch effort for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, and that state's caucuses also are Saturday. As long as those candidates remain in the race, it's unlikely their supporters will switch, and other campaigns are avoiding a strident pitch soas not to offend potential future supporters. `` Our county chairs and the people we had in place for the campaign are working, contacting supporters from other camps,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jochum </PERSON>, a state representative from <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. `` If I were a Gephardt supporter, I'd be waiting to see what the results are in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' Since <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses, former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> have formally dropped from the race. Few delegates are at stake there as <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> got less than 1 percent while <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> got 6 percent in the caucuses. `` People are going to wait to see what happens,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>. `` The only people who are going to move are the <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> people. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> people are going to wait.'' Caucus-goers selected 15,000 delegates to the county conventions and 30,000 alternates. They will elect 3,001 delegates to the six congressional district conventions May 14. Those delegates will pick 52 of the state's 58 national delegates. The state has six `` super'' delegates, who are elected officials and party leaders.

<HEAD>Moscow Uses New Plan, Helicopters to Combat Armenian Annexation
Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Kremlin laid out an 8-year plan Thursday night to pacify a <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region shaken by ethnic strife. At the same time, army helicopters were reported circling over the Armenian capital to prevent further unrest. The carrot-and-stick approach seemed aimed at cooling feelings inflamed by a noisy Armenian campaign to annex the region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and to warn Armenian activists to end their protests. Activists have said specifically that government efforts to improve poor economic and social conditions of Armenians in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> mountain region near the Soviet border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not meet their demands. Armenian newspaper editor <PERSON> Regyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and scene of mass pro-annexation demonstrations in February, was being patrolled by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and soldiers. He said no violence was reported. <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that most Armenians were showing patience in awaiting resolution of the issue. On Feb. 28, rioting broke out in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, and officials said 32 people were killed. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, has a population that is 75 percent Armenian but has been a part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's highest government body, rejected as `` intolerable'' Wednesday the campaign for annexation of the region, indicating it would not bend to pressure from mass protests. The Presidium, meanwhile, ordered ministries to solve `` pressing problems of the economic, social and cultural development'' of the region. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> made public details of their proposals Thursday. The plan for 1988-95 calls for stepping up the pace of construction of schools, hospitals, apartments and roads in the region and for increasing the publication of Armenian literature. `` Work will also be completed to ensure a steady reception of the national television program, as well as ... telecasts of Armenian and Azerbaijani television,'' the officia <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a report on the Politburo meeting. The plan calls for increasing by 50 percent the industrial output of the region. The plan approved by the Politburo was formulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body, and the government <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the Politburo deemed it `` essential to resolutely discourage the slightest manifestations of nationalism or disrespect for national sentiments of members of various ethnic groups.'' Last week, a prominent Soviet journalist writing in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News weekly said residents of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> suffer cultural and economic disadvantages. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachaturov </PERSON> said people there have difficulty getting books in their native language and officials have not made good on pledges to build a sports complex and children's institutions. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said Thursday that a correspondent for an unofficial human rights journal called from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to say Soviet army helicopters were patrolling the city, but no widespread disorder was reported. <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON>, a senior editor of the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, confirmed the helicopter report and added that soldiers were deployed around <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to ensure order. Activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> had called for another show of support for the annexation drive with demonstrations and strikes beginning Saturday, when a group of activists and officials plans to meet to discuss a future course of action. <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON> says it is his personal belief that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should be united with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He said he does not expect a large turnout at the demonstrations or widespread participation in the strikes called for by activists. Moscow-based dissidents say they've been told thousands plan to take to the streets. The Presidium did not directly address the question of annexation. Last month's mass protests in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> subsided after Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed on Feb. 26 for calm and promised a party review of the annexation question. Demonstrations were held again in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> this week after a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the annexation drive had a `` clear anti-socialist spirit.'' Activists said 7,000 people took part in a protest march Monday.

 A former nuclear technician who claimed he revealed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s atomic secrets for the good of humanity was convicted Thursday of espionage and treason and could be sentenced to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, 34, was found guilty by a three-judge panel after a trial that had been closed to the public since it began in September. His lawyer said the <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> would appeal the verdict to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> is very disappointed,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Avigdor </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>. `` The court decided that he was a traitor, and he had hoped to be seen differently. But he is not broken. He is looking ahead to the appeal.'' The conviction carries a maximum sentence of death. However, prosecutor <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasson </PERSON> said he would ask the court for a sentence of life imprisonment, which in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is limited to 20 years. Sentencing is set for Sunday. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, who worked nine years at the nuclear facility in <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION>, was charged for revealing details of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s atomic capacity to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986. The newspaper said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s information showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had stockpiled the world's sixth-largest nuclear arsenal. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> never has responded directly to allegations of its nuclear capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to introduce such weapons into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> has insisted he made his revelations to alert the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons. The state argued he intended to harm <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. He was kept under heavy security during the trial, which was closed to the public because authorities feared an open hearing would harm state security. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> has been held in near isolation for the last 18 months and has been permitted to see only his attorney and family. The precautions were taken after <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> managed to flash a message to reporters at a pre-trial appearance by scribbling it on the palm of his hand. In the message he said he had been kidnapped in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, presumably by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents, and brought to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for trial. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was fired from the <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION> nuclear center in 1985 and went to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where he became acquainted with a priest and converted to Christianity. He later traveled to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but disappeared in October 1986, just days before <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published his revelations. Israeli officials acknowledged several weeks later he was in custody in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Details of <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s journey back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were revealed by his brother, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was lured from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman named <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, who promised him sex. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, he was abducted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents and spirited home, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said. During the trial, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> argued <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> did not hurt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security because information about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear capacity was available in the academic world He said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> had in fact helped state security because allegations of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear strength served as a deterrent to Arab enemies.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Senate Bill To Protect Historic Shipwrecks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation pushed by archaeologists to save historic shipwrecks won <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee approval Wednesday despite complaints from recreational divers that the bill could block their enjoyment of the undersea landmarks. The bill is designed to clear up the murky legal status of shipwreck jurisdiction by giving states authority over certain downed vessels in state waters, preventing salvage operators from destroying historic remains. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> put aside a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of the measure and passed 29-10, largely along party lines, a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed in December. Democrats led by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who has advocated a shipwreck preservation law for a decade, said they agreed with an amendment proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., mandating that states make shipwrecks accessible to But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and others noted that an amended bill would need <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval again, and they were afraid the measure would die there as it has in past years. This is the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved a shipwreck bill. `` Do n't kill this bill by making it perfect,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> urged. `` I'm afraid it's going to be a better corpse.'' <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>, pointing to vocal opposition from sport diving groups, said the legislation should spell out guarantees for divers. `` I think this bill can be vastly improved,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> retorted that `` if you do n't pass this bill, there wo n't be any shipwrecks to dive on. Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, who said she is a recreational diver, agreed, joining Democrats in defeating the Shumway amendment 25-14. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said later that he expected easy passage on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supports the measure. The committee agreed to place in a report that accompanies the bill language stating that it is the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for states to make shipwrecks accessible to divers. Under the legislation, states would have jurisdiction over historic shipwrecks within their three-mile state limits. They would be charged with establishing protective areas, allowing recreational exploration and overseeing public and private salvage efforts. Under admiralty laws, discoverers of wrecks can salvage abandoned vessels. Those laws are at odds with many state statutes.

 For 58 hours after a toddler tumbled into an abandoned well, hundreds of rescuers worked together to free her, but now an effort to bring their heroism to television has divided them. Two groups _ one mostly volunteer rescuers and the other city officials _ are negotiating separately with different TV producers for a movie of the story that captured the nation's attention as it unfolded live on television. Both groups are awaiting the endorsement of Chip and <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, whose 23-month-old daughter <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> became stuck in a 22-foot-deep well for 58 hours in October. One volunteer rescuer, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>, said he is remaining neutral in the dispute. But he said he wonders whether the story could be told properly in any case. `` I am wondering if a unified group got together ... if a really true, accurate picture of what took place could ever be put on the screen,'' said <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airmaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which contributed drilling materials for the rescue. The effort brought praise and a spotlight to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, an oil town of 97,400 people in western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It was a special event. There was so much effort, and everyone had their own story. Maybe it should be kept special like that,'' he said Thursday. The <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> <PERSON> Rescuer </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of about 30 volunteers, is committed to a movie deal with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> producer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The group has asked all rescuers to join them. The association's president, <PERSON> Kragg </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said 33 members have signed a contract that includes an initial $ 200,000, plus future payments, to be divided among the membership. The other group, the <ORGANIZATION> McClure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has narrowed its selection to an unidentified producer but has not signed any commitments. The association, comprising 11 municipal officials including Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Czech </PERSON>, Fire Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and paramedic <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, wants nothing to do with <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>. `` We found that he was going around to individual members of our association offering each member side deals that the others did n't know about,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allday </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the group <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> says everyone was offered the same deal _ a chance to consult in the production or to act in it. Either group or neither group could end up actually making a film. <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> still needs a commitment from a network for his project. `` My advice to anyone is if they have not signed with the producer to not do so until the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> say who they want the movie to be made by,'' said <PERSON> Allday </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> have said they do n't want to profit by their daughter's story, but do not want to stand in the way of the story being told. <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON> said Thursday he is concerned that the group of municipal workers will not allow others to help negotiate a movie deal. He said he and other neutral volunteers are working to bring the groups together `` so that the same type of unity and spirit as depicted last October can return.'' `` I'm sad about this problem,'' he said. `` My concern is that there were several hundred people out there and it is not right that maybe the lady that brought us hamburgers at three in the morning, or the guy who brought the sanitary privvies down _ how do you say they should not be in the movie, too?''

A police spokesman described the attack as `` very fierce.'' He said six Israeli warplanes dropped 30 bombs in six sorties within 55 minutes. Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> instructed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to complain to the world body about the attacks, state radio said. But <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> did not ask for a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting on the issue, it said. The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with standing regulations, said the main target was <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s guerrilla base, but the jets also hit a position of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` The Israelis plowed the olive groves where the stricken bases are,'' he added. The bases were engulfed by smoke and dust as ambulances arrived to evacuate casualties. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s guerrillas cordoned off the bases in the villages of <LOCATION> Bekasta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Majdelyoun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salhiyeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abra </PERSON> on the southern and eastern edges of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The jets dropped scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking missiles. The guerrillas fired at the roaring jets with Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns. No hits were reported. `` Let the enemy wait for coming blows of our revolutionary fighters,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We shall strike doubly in merciless retaliation.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> _ real name <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON> _ broke from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. He has since claimed attacks against a series of civilian targets around the world. The elusive terrorist mastermind tops wanted lists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. His whereabouts are not known, altough recent reports said he has been shuttling between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. His group also vowed revenge after Wednesday's strike, saying in a statement it would `` severely strike back against the Zionist enemy's arrogance and barbarism ... at the right time and place.'' Wednesday's attack targeted bases of the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction headed by <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>. Police said eight people were killed and 15 wounded in the attacks. In all, 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in five Israeli air raids this year, by Lebanese police count.

 Clutching a feline named Pole Cat, <PERSON> Mellissa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> climbed into the bucket of a hook-and-ladder fire truck and returned to earth Thursday after a record 517 days sitting atop a 43-foot pole. `` My knees are wobbly but I feel great,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who was embraced by her mother, <PERSON> Mauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` Without the cat, I would never have made it.'' Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 19, broke the world record Feb. 25 when she overtook the 488-day mark set by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. She now is in the Guinness World Book of Records. Her fiance, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, greeted her on the ground. They met after Seal read an article about her effort to raise money for cancer research and telephoned her. They announced their engagement in August, before meeting. `` I've been waiting a year for this,'' he said. About 1,000 people gathered to watch Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' descent from the shack she called home for 1 -LCB- years. Some handed her bouquets, others made contributions for her cancer fund-raising efforts. `` All this does n't seem real,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' mother, who herself set a record of 211 days atop a pole in 1959. `` We want her back with us, but honestly it seems like only yesterday that she went up there.'' Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said her first activity would be to `` drive around town, then take a good long walk.'' She had said she was proud to have raised $ 10,000 for cancer research but had hoped to climb down with $ 100,000. Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, has cancer and has been in remission for four years `` I'm sure she'll look back on this with fond memories,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' aunt <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowls </PERSON>. `` Maybe she saved a life by doing this. And that's about all you can ask for.'' Firefighters were on hand to make sure Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> made it safely to the ground from the three-story shack. `` She's going to look up and be lonely when she passes by here next,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>. `` It's been her home and when you take someone out of their home _ no matter how much they want to go _ they're going to look back with longing.'' Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' 6-by-7-by-9-foot shack was equipped with a plastic kiddie pool, television and a telephone that resulted in regular $ 300 phone bills. For company she had her cat, Pole Cat. Before coming down, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> admitted, `` There were some real sad times, times that were real hard.'' `` But I always knew I would make it, even when I was scared or going through hard times,'' said the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, native, who rode out 70 mph winds during a major snowstorm in February. Seal first contacted Miss Sanders in November 1986. They communicated, but did not meet face-to-face until November 1987. `` Now that she's getting down we have to start dating,'' said Seal. `` I mean we're already engaged and we have n't even gone on a date.''

<HEAD>Embassy Demonstration for Soviet Jews Tests New Supreme Court
Ruling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of Soviet Jews tested a new <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling Wednesday that knocked down rules banning peaceful demonstrations within 500 feet of foreign embassies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The dozen demonstrators, accompanied for a time by Sens. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., gave speeches on the sidewalk in front of the Soviet Embassy Then seven of them sat down on the sidewalk, prayed and sang. Some taunted Soviet officials as they moved freely in and out of the embassy gate. The police, whose numbers rivaled those of the demonstrators, did nothing to impede the protest. They quietly ensured that the driveway and embassy gate remained clear and they steered pedestrians through the maze of protesters and the accompanying phalanx of reporters and photographers. Police made no move to arrest anyone. In fact, they stopped traffic on busy 16th Street so the demonstrators could move back and forth to the embassy. `` They ca n't block the driveway,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police. `` They ca n't block free passage of the sidewalk.'' Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the chairman of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, was a leader of Wednesday's demonstration He has been arrested several times for violating the limits on protests near the Soviet Embassy. `` There are those who say the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ruling takes away the dramatic tool of arrest,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said before the demonstration began. But he warned, `` If the necessity arises that we'll have to sit peacefully in front of the gates, then that's something I'd be willing to do.'' In Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, writing for the court, said police may disperse groups of three or more congregating near embassies when they `` reasonably believe that a threat to the security or peace of the embassy is present.'' Banning such gatherings `` does not prohibit peaceful congregations,'' she wrote, adding that the ban `` is limited to groups posing a security threat.'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the court's ruling `` allows a far greater voice for Soviet Jews specifically at a time when so many have been duped by ` glasnost.''' Glasnost is the Russian word for `` openness.'' He condemned an upcoming trip by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and some 500 business executives to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There can not be an increase of trade, an increase of loans without a concession on human rights on the other side,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. As the demonstration commenced in front of the embassy, a dozen Soviet officials sat in the patio on the other side of the gates, enjoying the suddenly springlike weather, chatting amongst themselves and occasionally gazing at the demonstrators. As the protestors sang at one point, a Soviet official walked into the front gate, barely suppressing a smile.

<HEAD>Motorola To Pay $16.7 Million In Fines For Navy Mischarges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s electronics group has agreed to pay the government $ 16.7 million and to plead guilty to a criminal information accusing it of mischarging for labor and materials on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> satellite and missile contracts, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. In documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was accused of inflating costs for a component of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> satellite communications and mischarging $ 2.5 million in labor, materials and other costs The money actually was spent on other work, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, relying on the inflated amounts, paid some $ 5 million more than it should have on a second contract for the satellite communications system, said the government. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's top 50 defense contractors, agreed to plead guilty to three counts of making false statements. The firm said in a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, that `` it is now clear in retrospect'' that the electronics group's `` systems were not adequate to ensure total compliance with applicable laws and regulations.'' `` The conduct of the employees involved in these programs failed to conform to <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s own internal standards,'' the statement added. The electronics group `` has greatly expanded its compliance efforts'' with reforms which `` are now an integral part of the way GEG does business.'' Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a court, the government has agreed not to prosecute the company further on the contracts, but reserves the right to prosecute individuals. The court documents also say the firm mischarged labor costs for work on 10 contracts involving production of target detecting devices for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Standard missile. The third count in the criminal information said <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> mischarged labor costs on a contract for the production of targeting detecting devices for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 16.7 million in criminal fines, restitution and civil penalties. The company already has paid $ 6.8 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The pleas result from an investigation into labor and materials charging and pricing practices by <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> from 1979 to 1984.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The guns were silent Thursday, the first day of an agreement between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels that Nicaraguans pray will bring peace for the first time since 1981. One man called it a miracle. During three days of negotiations that resulted in agreement Wednesday night, both sides had said it was the last chance for peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The formal, 60-day cease-fire is to begin April 1, but they agreed to extend a truce declared for the talks. <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday: `` I believe that the agreement is a hope... It is not a question of saying now who won and who lost in the agreement, but that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and thousands of mothers who have sons in the war won.'' <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who owns a shoe store and has three nephews in the army, said: `` This is the most important thing that has occcured since 1979 when the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dictatorship was overthrown.'' In a broadcast Thursday, the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The -LRB- Nicaraguan -RRB- Resistance has taken an initial step to end the hostilities in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a very significant step.'' <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-government newspaper, asked a question in its banner headline: `` Cease Fire! Peace Explodes?'' <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, president of the private enterprise council and staunch government critic, called the pact `` a miracle,'' and added: `` Perhaps the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will finally comply with its word.'' During the negotiations at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, on the Costa Rican border 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made a suprise visit and said it was time `` to bury once and for all the military confrontation.'' Rebel leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told journalists at the meeting: `` It is not just a chance to achieve peace and harmony, but the only chance.'' Leaders of the Sandinistas and the U.S.-sponsored Contras stood side-by-side on a makeshift dais Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, sang the national anthem together and signed the cease-fire. During the three days, both sides retreated from hard positions, especially the <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON>, who stand to gain the most from an agreement that would virtually end the insurgency. The Contras agreed not to accept military aid and to receive non-lethal supplies exclusively from neutral organizations. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which has financed the rebels since they began fighting in late 1981, has been seeking congressional approval of more funds. Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regional peace plan signed Aug. 7 by all five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents _ ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoring democratic freedoms. Opponents of the Sandinistas say they promised democracy when overthrew rightist President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979, but instead established a Marxist regime. Although the cease-fire does not begin officially until April 1, both sides said they would continue the battlefield truce they declared on Monday, the first day of negotiations. Beginning Monday, also in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, negotiators will draw the lines of areas to which rebels will go during the first two weeks of the official cease-fire. Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying down their weapons, so that may be another subject taken up in next week's meetings. In past negotiations, the rebels insisted on keeping their weapons until provisions of any accord were carried out. Also not mentioned is a reduction of the 80,000-member regular armed forces, largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The government claims to have 300,000 people under arms, including army, reserves and civilian militia. Gradual amnesty is provided for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 3,300 political prisoners, beginning Sunday. The deal also guarantees `` unrestricted freedom of expression,'' demanded by the rebels, and permits all exiles to return home. With verification that the Contras have moved into the truce zones, they can send up to eight delegates to participate in national talks now under way in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as part of the regional peace plan, the agreement says. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed that the `` issues related to military service will be dealt with.'' Contra negotiators had insisted forced military service be ended. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government granted a rebel request that compliance with the agreement be verified by a commission formed by Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and the secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. Both were witnesses to the talks and it was <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> who read the final document aloud. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> had mediated previous negotiations outside the coutnry.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, pressing on with his hard-line trade stance, on Thursday denied statements from aides that he would shut down his campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination if he does not win Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. Amid turmoil over reports that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was a do-or-die state for him, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> delivered a speech here and denounced a `` dogmatic and outdated'' free trade theology that has cost the nation jobs. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> brushed aside questions about the future of his campaign, but aides spoke privately of a decision hinging on the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucus outcome. Plans are in motion for the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman to file for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat by the Tuesday deadline, said the aides, if <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> does not give him his first victory since the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary on Feb. 23. `` That's right. He will be out if does n't win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said a campaign aide who would not be quoted by name. Asked if that aide's comment was accurate, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told reporters: `` No. I'm running for president and I've doing very well here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. ... I'm going to win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. I'm going to continue and do well.'' `` My mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time. That's what I'm trying to do,'' he added `` Rather than trying to guess all the different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think we have to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide what other steps should be taken.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aides said publicly that nothing has changed in the past 48 hours, that it has been understood since Super Tuesday that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would end his race if he does not win here. The candidate's wife put it this way on Thursday: `` I think <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> has to come in first or a real strong second to remain in the race, because at some point if you do n't do well here, it becomes difficult to raise money,''' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> WTVB </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s message will be very popular in the industrial states, but if we do n't do well here, we will not be able to continue.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is running third in the polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Later Thursday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> mimicked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim of turning around the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy, adapting it to his campaign by saying `` This Saturday we're going to have a miracle in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> miracle.'' Tuesday is the deadline for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to file for re-election for his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. A meeting has been scheduled this weekend for the Democrats who have filed for the seat. One reason for the withdrawal _ and the congressional race _ would be to take care of any debts left over from the presidential bid. `` Only as Rep. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> can he raise the money to pay off the debts'' from the presidential campaign, one aide said. But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> denied the campaign had a big debt and said that is not a factor. One of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s problems was inadvertantly emphasized by the presence of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s news conference The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> has not endorsed any candidate, and <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> refused to say he would vote for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in the caucuses. Union backing would be a major boost to a candidate in the low-turnout caucus process, but particularly for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, whose trade policies have had strong UAW backing. `` I come here today because I want to pay my respects to Rep. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and the respects of my union to a person who has fought very hard to bring about fair trade,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> gave a lengthy speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, trying to explain again his trade positions and the reasons his ideas have encountered such resistance. `` We will not open markets abroad until we first open minds here at home,'' the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman said, adding `` The free market is not sacred.'' He mentioned only one opponent by name, chiding <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for now supporting trade legislation that he earlier opposed. `` I welcome converts,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` But we need more than a political tactic _ we need a real policy commitment.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> laid out in his speech why he thought his trade legislation has been denounced so strongly. `` The powerful voices ... are dogmatic and outdated,'' he said. `` They see things, not as they are, but as they wish them to be. ` Many of our trading partners are using our outdated assumptions _ our theology _ to take advantage of us,'' he said. And <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> rejected the allegation that his trade policies are somehow racist. `` Those of us who are calling for more realistic trade polices are accused of Japanese-bashing,'' he said. `` The issue here is not nationality, but the rationality of our trading arrangements.''

<TEXT>
 Angry unionized employees of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and supporters from other labor organizations rallied outside the Capitol on Wednesday in an effort to bring attention to their disputes with the carrier. The demonstrators, estimated at 1,200 by their leaders, heard speeches from several union leaders and from Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` I want airline pilots who belong to strong unions, so if they know they have unsafe conditions or unsafe airplanes, they can park that airplane and know they still have their jobs,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> told the crowd. Some Eastern pilots have complained that they have been pressured by company officials to fly aircraft that they believe need repairs. Eastern officials have said they would never allow unsafe planes to fly. Unions at Eastern have been battling the airline on a number of issues in recent years, aiming much of their fire at <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chief executive of the Miami-based carrier. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been trying to reduce costs at the financially ailing airline, but the unions say his goal is to reduce the power of labor.

 Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was a victim of `` political muscle and character assassination'' who would have fought excesses by the judiciary had he been seated on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination was turned down 58-42 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 23 by `` those partisans who would impermissibly seek to reshape the Constitution into a vehicle for their own limited political beliefs,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday night to the <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Story </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative lawyers' group A copy of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s remarks was released at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one ... deserves a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> more than <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said of the appeals court judge who drew strong opposition for his conservative views on the role of the judiciary and other constitutional issues. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the forces opposed to <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination `` used political muscle and character assassination to thwart the appointment of a most deserving person.'' <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and legal scholar <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, who were being honored at an awards banquet of the society, have fought unwarranted judicial activism which has been `` advocated by those forces who like to be called ` progressive,''' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` But ... their version of modern progressivism has passed democracy by, leaving it to today's conservatives to do what yesterday's progressives did: defend democracy,'' the attorney general said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> cited as an example of judicial activism a federal judge's ruling in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ordering additions to the facilities of local schools, and `` a doubling of the property tax rate to pay for them. He also criticized the ruling of a judge in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> who decreed a busing scheme for schools and vowed to require higher property taxes to pay for it if the voters failed to do so. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said judicial activism forecloses opportunities for local expression and leaves `` a drastically reduced scope for the institutions that are representative of citizen views.'' `` The pattern here is a subtle but dangerous transformation of the Constitution, such that it becomes less a plan of government and more an instrument for the regulation of potentially every personal action or policy decision _ regulation that the people themselves become powerless to control,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Mensa, the nationwide organization of high IQs, is looking for a few good brains. In an attempt to boost enrollment, 43 Mensa chapters around the country are using newspaper ads to invite people who think they are among the top 2 percent in intelligence to `` flex those mental muscles'' in a qualifying test. The ad reads: `` If you can score at or above the 98th percentile on a standard IQ test, you may be able to join Mensa, the society for the highly intelligent.'' The ad then lists how to register for the test, which costs $ 20. `` A lot of people have n't got the foggiest notion of what their IQ is,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, secretary of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> chapter. The chapter has about 50 members, and 10 people responded to its newspaper advertising, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Statistically, if you are talking about 2 percent of the population, and assuming <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> is representative, we ought to have 1,000 people in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> qualify,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON>, development officer for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said there are 56,000 members nationally from a pool of about 5 million potential qualifiers. `` We've been growing about 3 percent per year in the last three years,'' <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Growth of 8 to 10 percent per year would make us happy.'' The national headquarters gave $ 10,000 in February to local chapters to buy advertising. The money was appropriated on a first-come, first-served basis to 43 of the 145 chapters. So far the ads have appeared in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, she said. In the past, the group has placed ads in specialized magazines, primarily scientific or literary journals, <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said. `` Obviously people with high IQs read newspapers as much or more than the average <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' he said, adding it was too early to judge the response from the newspaper ads. The group was also surprised at the response it got after articles appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> and Reader's Digest, <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anybody would qualify those magazines for the superintelligent,'' he said. Scoring among the top 2 percent nationally in any standardized IQ test is the only requirement for membership, which costs $ 33 per year, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` It's not uncommon to find people in the top 2 percent in prison,'' he said. `` High IQ people tend to frequently be high school dropouts. `` The only thing Mensas have in common other than IQ is their diversity,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose jobs have included police dispatcher, accounting teacher, computer analyst and irrigation canal manager. For the last two years he has operated his own pressure-washer business, which cleans large items like trucks and buildings. In central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, over half the <ORGANIZATION> Mensa </ORGANIZATION> members work at the federal government's <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, he said. With the phasing out of plutonium production there, the local chapter could soon be hurting unless it finds new members, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Mensa, which was founded in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1946, is primarily a social organization, promising stimulating activities and conversation, <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said. The tests measure logical and mathematical reasoning skills and the ability to distinguish relationships between words. `` Studying would n't help very much,'' <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> run neck-and-neck as favorites for the presidency, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outpolls other potential Democratic nominees, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said Thursday. Among Democratic voters alone, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was seen as the candidate with the best chance of beating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November, the survey said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a commanding lead in his race for the Republican presidential nomination. In a Bush-Dukakis matchup, 46 percent of all registered voters polled said they favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 45 percent chose <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The margin of error for the survey was plus or minus 3 percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> polled 51 percent support to 36 percent for Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and 56 percent to 32 percent for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The poll did not include a matchup of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vs. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> or Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. In a similar poll reported Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 50 percent support, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 45. That survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points, so the spread did not signify a lead. Among likely Democratic voters in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 53 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the best chance of defeating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the general election. Twelve percent said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 9 percent <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 8 percent <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and 6 percent <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. When the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll asked the same question in a Feb. 17-21 poll, far fewer Democrats _ 38 percent _ said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the best chance to beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was next with 20 percent and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had only 5 percent. On Super Tuesday, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won five states apiece, while <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won only his native state. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also won five states, but in the poll that did not translate into an expectation he was more likely to beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In the Democratic primary race, 29 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> respondents favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the nomination, 22 percent <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 14 percent <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 8 percent <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and 6 percent <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Seventeen percent said they did n't know. The support from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was up from 13 percent in the February CBS-Times poll, while the support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was up from 21 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s was up from 8 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> previously had 12 percent, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 6. The CBS-Times poll included telephone interviews of 1,271 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide from Saturday through Tuesday, of whom 528 were likely Democratic primary voters. The sampling error for the Democrats was 5 points.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s presidential campaign confirmed Thursday it borrowed more than $ 1.4 million early this month, putting up collateral that included future federal matching funds and a personal guarantee by the candidate himself. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who was questioned about the loans earlier in the day, said he did not object to releasing the details. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Armour </PERSON> said the loans were secured by the campaign's federal matching funds, plus accounts receivable and a personal guarantee totaling $ 40,000 by <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> himself. The campaign issued a statement saying it borrowed $ 750,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Sovran-D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on March 1, pledging future contributions, federal matching funds and other future income as collateral. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign also borrowed $ 400,000 on March 11 from <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, secured by a guarantee from <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and future matching funds. The campaign said it borrowed $ 100,000 from each of three smaller banks in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on March 1, also secured by the candidate's guarantee and future matching funds. Armour denied that the banks showed any special favor in granting the loans, stating, `` They were all handled at arm's length through lawyers on both sides. `` There's nothing that is in any violation of any laws or regulations and there's no cause for suggesting that there is,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a news conference. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign previously has acknowledged only that it had established a $ 1 million line of credit to be used as necessary for television advertising on Super Tuesday. On Thursday, The Tennessean newspaper in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign had put up the proceeds of future fund-raisers and federal matching funds as collateral for almost $ 1.5 million borrowed from banks about two weeks ago. `` I have no problem with telling you the amount of the loans and which banks they came from, be glad to,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said details of the loans would be contained in reports to be filed in the next two or three weeks with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> `` so if you can wait two or three weeks all of that will be available, but as for now I have no problem with giving you the amount of the loans, the banks et cetera.'' The next <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reporting date is April 20. The loans were taken out after Feb. 29 so they did not have to be disclosed March 20. The due date for the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> loans is July 15, three days before the Democratic National Convention begins in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The latest <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> FEC disclosure, made public Sunday, covers the period from Feb. 1 to Feb. 29. It shows that, to date, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has spent $ 6 million on his presidential bid, and had $ 342,964 in cash on hand as of Feb. 29. The capaign has taken in $ 1.5 million this month, <PERSON> Armour </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign also announced Thursday that it has retained media consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> to manage all of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s media for the critical <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19.

 A 23-year-old investment adviser accused of using $ 10 million in clients' money to buy himself an art collection, a beach house, fancy cars and other luxuries will probably plead guilty to fraud, his lawyer said Thursday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> briefly appeared before a federal magistrate Thursday and waived his right to have the case heard by a grand jury.

Prosecutors said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who was n't licensed as an investment adviser, told clients their funds were invested in the stock market when he actually was pouring the money into private purchases.

 A top opposition leader returned from exile to a hero's welcome Thursday and said he will join his countrymen's struggle which he said has `` but one objective _ to get rid of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' The return of <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, came on the fourth day of a nationwide strike aimed at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. The strikers' solidarity seemed unbroken, with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at a virtual standstill. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic archbishop, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, acknowledged meeting with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Thursday morning, but denied rumors he was trying to mediate the general's departure. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter when stopped outside his home, `` We have met with the general a number of times in the past few months and we will meet with him again soon.'' Asked if he was acting as go-between for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s exit, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said, `` No.'' The church's <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> met Wednesday, raising opposition hopes that the bishops would demand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal But the closed-door session ended with no communique. There was speculation the bishops remained silent awaiting the outcome of the <LOCATION> McGrath-Noriega </LOCATION> meeting Thursday. A cheering crowd of more than 300 people greeted <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> at the airport. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who is considered a presidential aspirant in elections scheduled for May 1989, told the crowd: `` I am profoundly moved to be back in my own land. We have but one objective _ to get rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and build reconciliation and democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' He rejected any talks with the government, as suggested this week by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s new, hand-picked civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> is simply a voice, the recent voice for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He means absolutely nothing for this country,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. His flight was delayed more than an hour because the Panamanian airline, COPA, at first refused to let him board at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, citing government orders. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, called it an `` attempt to intimidate him, to get him to back down. But it was the government that backed down instead.'' With <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> were five <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> legislators from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to help ensure his safety. At least 100 journalists covered his arrival. Despite virtually unanimous support for the general strike by business and industry, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the power behind the civilian government _ remained defiant. He said his foes at home and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do n't `` have the capacity'' to overthrow him. That feeling appeared to be shared by some strike leaders, who said it might take a revolt by fellow officers to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as military chief. `` There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that are against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulino </PERSON>, an attorney and opposition leader. `` What we do n't know is if they will act.'' But in a Wednesday night speech, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claimed the military was maintaining `` its high moral and patriotic beliefs'' despite a failed barracks coup last week. Eleven officers were arrested in that foiled plot. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dismissed more than a dozen officers and shifted the assignments of other key personnel. Still, the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are due to be paid Friday, and opposition leaders said their loyalty to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be tested anew if they do n't get their paychecks. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is out of cash because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cut off the supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into exile. The general was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges. The government was unable to fully meet a $ 33 million payroll for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching off a series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once considered loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The next semi-monthly paychecks for most government employees are due next week, following the military payday, and they could be stirred to renewed fury if the army gets paid and they do n't. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> shared second place on a losing presidential ticket in 1984 and has made himself highly visible in the more than nine months of civic demonstrations and protests against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In addition to his party leadership, he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of about 200 business, professional, labor and political groups seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was denied entry Feb. 25 when he sought to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from a business trip to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. That was the day former President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to dismiss <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but was in turn deposed by the general. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not going to play `` big colossus of the North'' and use military force to get <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power. In a question-and-answer session with high school students in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if he thought it would be necessary to resume <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military control in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to protect the safety of the canal zone. `` No, we're going to abide by the canal treaty -LRB- relinquishing the canal to the Panamanians by the turn of the century -RRB-,'' he replied. `` And we're not going to be the big colossus of the North once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of living and business and trying to guide and direct them.'' The president said the Panamanians `` have a very difficult problem there. We think that they're moving toward solving it with the reaction of the people to the man that has caused so much of this problem.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants `` to be of help in any way we can, and so we've helped them in that regard in the economic restraints that we've put down there so that there can be pressure focused on this particular individual.'' `` But there's no danger of us coming in with our power and muscle and saying, ` This is the way it has to be.''' Meanwhile, the office of Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will provide emergency food to the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, at least $ 25,000 worth of food per day to be distributed through <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> relief agency. The money for the food would come from the federal disaster relief fund, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a D'Amato spokesman. He said he did not know how long the aid would continue. AID officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A man answering the phone there late Thursday said no one was in the agency's Latin bureau. The agency was known to be considering such a move. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is out of cash because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cut off the supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into exile. The general was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges. The Panamanian government was unable to fully meet a $ 33 million payroll for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching off a series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once considered loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 Democrats who had hoped to succeed Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> faced the prospect Thursday of having to bow out amid reports <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would abandon his presidential bid and seek re-election to the House. `` I'm a little upset,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Democrat considered one of the leading contenders to replace <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the 3rd Congressional District representative for six terms. `` I'm saddened. I guess that's a nice way to put it,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who has the endorsement of labor and other groups and has raised about $ 27,000. Six Democrats have filed for the seat, and at least two others are considering a bid. A <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign aide who insisted on anonymity said Wednesday that if <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> did not win the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses Saturday he probably would announce the end of his campaign Monday and file for re-election. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> later denied that he was considering such a move. <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> said she thought that if <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> decided to seek re-election the other candidates would not have much choice but to step aside. `` It's going to be a big blow to some of them but they all knew when they got in that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> could come back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> said. `` They're prepared for it.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said he most likely would step aside if <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> wanted to keep his congressional seat. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Temporiti </PERSON>, the first Democrat to file for the seat and an active campaigner, was out of his office Thursday, his secretary said. <PERSON> Temporiti </PERSON> is a lawyer and former chief of staff for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. To be a candidate for his congressional seat, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would have to file with the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> secretary of state's office by the close of business Tuesday He could file for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat and remain in the presidential race but would have to withdraw from the congressional race if he were to win the presidential nomination. Other Democrats to file are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s top <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> aide; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitt </PERSON>, a house painter; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Vires </PERSON>, a retired high school teacher, and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, who has run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> five times. Four Republicans have filed, but none was expected to be a serious challenge in the heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> district.

 Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> suffered a heart attack Thursday and was hospitalized in very critical condition, officials said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, 60, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, collapsed on a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> golf course near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at about 10 a.m., his office said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Democrat was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where doctors revived him after two hours, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Janzik </PERSON> said. He had suffered a heart attack, which stopped his heart, and he was listed in very critical condition, Ms. <PERSON> Janzik </PERSON> said. He later was taken by helicopter to the cardiac unit of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, she said. `` He was breathing on his own,'' Ms. <PERSON> Janzik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s office said Wednesday night he was in `` critical condition'' and under intensive care. His wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, were with him. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the victim of two previous heart attacks, collapsed at the <ORGANIZATION> Manor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Plecker </PERSON>, a golf pro at the club, told the Montgomery -LRB- Md. -RRB- Journal that he saw <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> collapse. The pro said he ran over and started administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Two <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighters who happened to be golfing at the time then took over resuscitation efforts until a rescue squad arrived, <PERSON> Plecker </PERSON> said. `` If anything could be done for that guy, he was lucky to have those guys right there,'' <PERSON> Plecker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was hospitalized for several days in 1984 in an episode doctors attributed to fatigue.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration warmly welcomed a Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement Thursday, and some officials said it could usher in a new era of bipartisan <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymaking on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We consider this agreement to be an important step forward,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who added that the truce leaves `` no excuse'' for continued Soviet-bloc weapons shipments to the leftist <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the Nicaraguan agreement marks `` a new chapter in the unhappy history of that war-torn country'' and vowed to move ahead before Easter on a package of humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels. Later, appearing on PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer `` NewsHour,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> indicated the administration might ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to include in any humanitarian aid package a provision guaranteeing a speedy vote on a military aid request if the peace process breaks down. `` I do think there is great merit ... to have in it a mechanism for a fast-track vote,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Such a provision, he said, would help `` to have a little strength visible in the picture even though it is n't there.'' But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, appearing on the same program, suggested he would oppose such a provision. He said the package should include food, clothing and medical assistance for the Contras. Asked whether the legislation should ensure an early vote on military aid if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asks for it, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` I want to emphasize positive things, and not anticipate failure.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>, a leading Contra opponent, said, `` This is a bad day for the cynics. A piece of paper has been signed by people who many thought would never be able to sit down face to face.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also said the accord, while a strong sign of new health for the regional peace process, rests heavily on promises of future moves by both sides that could prove difficult. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, getting into his limousine after speaking to high school students in suburban <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was asked whether he thought the cease-fire agreement would hold up. `` I do n't know. We're looking carefully at it,'' he replied. `` There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to balance those two off,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen processes like this start before and fail,'' he said. `` This seems like a more concrete step, and there certainly reason to be hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skepticism side of it either because we are skeptical.'' Congressional leaders and the administration began conferring on a new package of aid to the Contras on Wednesday, and more meetings were scheduled for Monday. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said a vote could come later next week and food, clothing and medicine could begin flowing to the rebels by Easter. The cease-fire agreement reached Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, calls for `` exclusively humanitarian'' aid for the rebels to be channeled through a `` neutral'' organization, presumably the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> or some similar group. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said any aid package would have to conform to that language, and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the issue said that would rule out provisions for future military aid to the rebels. But some Republicans insisted that any aid bill include provision for a quick vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on new military aid if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> fail to live up to promises made in the cease-fire agreement, including amnesty and the release of prisoners. `` I think it is important to keep in there some speeded-up mechanism for the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get together in case the peace process fails,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., a sponsor of a Contra aid package that includes such a guaranteed vote `` It's a recognition that there is still lots of skepticism, maybe even suspicion, all the way around,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` People have been at each other's throats, and that's not going to dissipate easily.'' But of such suggestions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said: `` I think it would be counterproductive to talk about it ... We do n't want to rekindle the war.'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said compromise on language about future Contra aid was possible `` We are willing to talk to the Republicans about anything, but we are not willing to set up a process that the Nicaraguans could interpret as allowing for more military aid,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. House Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> issues conference, said he had discussed with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Wednesday a $ 48 million, one-year aid package that provided an expedited vote on further aid in June, although the rules for that vote remained to be worked out. Added Republican Whip <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>: `` The Contras are still in the field. They still have got to exist ... in case this thing collapses.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said terms discussed Wednesday before the cease-fire agreement was concluded _ including the $ 48 million figure and any process for a quick later aid vote _ would have to be reviewed in light of the Sandinista-Contra accord. `` I think that can be worked out,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` It looks like there may be a pretty good possibility of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> getting together on something the administration could buy,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` We have n't had a strong voice for American policy in Central America in five years'' because of partisan divisions over the administration's Contra policy,'' he said. `` We would finally be sending a clear message.'' `` For heaven's sake, if the Nicaraguans, who have been shooting at each other, can agree, surely Republicans and Democrats can agree,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The promises of quick action on a new aid package for the rebels contrasted sharply with the inaction of recent weeks. The issue had been stalled since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narrowly defeated a $ 30 million humanitarian aid package on March 3, and the rebels have been without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance since Feb. 29. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said lawmakers had been intentionally moving slowly on the issue since March 17, when <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders called <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office and said they were optimistic about achieving a cease-fire in the talks that began Monday and asked that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hold back on voting for new aid

<TEXT>
 Speeding through stiff winds and heavy seas early Thursday, we closed in on an Iranian landing craft that served as mother ship for speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The decks were lashed by 15-foot waves and winds gusting to 50 knots but Cmdr <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, skipper of this 445-foot guided missile frigate, covered the the 45 miles to the Hengham-class landing craft and halted his pursuit 4,600 yards from his quarry. While there was no actual confrontation, not even a radio exchange, the presence of the American warship appeared to distract the landing craft Tomb from its mission. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers said that mission apparently was to serve as a floating base for speedboats that attack ships with machine-gun and rocket grenade fire. `` He now knows we know where he is. We can come back now and find him any time we want,'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> told reporters in a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news pool aboard the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Increasingly, warships such as <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Fast Frigate No. 88 are closely monitoring the activities of Iranian warships in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Their purpose apparently is to discourage Iranian attacks on neutral shipping in the waterway, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. Such missions may reflect a subtle but potentially significant shift in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> policy under Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less, who took command of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> and its gulf component last month. American officers say there is no change in the `` rules of engagement.'' Those permit <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships to offer `` humanitarian assistance'' to neutral ships in distress that request help but prohibit them from interceding to stop an attack on a ship not flying the Stars and Stripes However, with the success of its primary mission to escort convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers through these hazardous waters, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> may be adopting a more visible role to deter Iranian attacks. <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, a 40-year New Yorker who now lives in <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, parried questions about any new mission. His instructions concerning Iranian activity remain clear, he said: `` Do not close -LRB- on -RRB- him; do not harass him; leave him alone.'' The first sign of a shift in approach comes at a time when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have resumed attacks on gulf shipping. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> uses warplanes to strike shuttle tankers carrying Iranian oil through the gulf. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> retaliates with raids by speedboats and larger vessels on neutral shipping. Nearly 500 ships have been damaged since the war began and more than 300 sailors have been killed. After the dash to draw within close range of the Iranian craft, <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said it tried to turn the tables by approaching to within 1,200 yards of the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> soon after dawn Thursday. The American warship abruptly changed course, wheeling on the approaching Iranian, and it altered course. The Tomb kept to a parallel course as the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> sailed into the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the narrow southern gate to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and joined its sister ship <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the frigate USS Bagley. They sailed westward into the teeth of a continuing shamal, a gulf storm that blows from the northwest and typically lasts about 24 hours. Winds exceeded 25 knots most of the day. Seas ran more than 15 feet, rolling the ships on their beams. Under clear skies, the roaring winds churned the relatively shallow <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> into a white-capped maelstrom. Waves crashed over the bows of the warships and their hulls were exposed to view as they hobby-horsed up the Hormuz. Although routine for the 202 crew members, pursuit of the Iranian vessel had considerable minute-by-minute drama. The Roberts combat information center, its computer screens aglow like a video arcade, tracked a variety of unidentified air and sea `` contacts'' as the ship headed south. <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> ordered his second gas turbine engine fired up to help drive the ship at up to 26 knots, then varied speed as the Tomb became a visible light in the distance. Huge waves were illuminated by phosphorescent plankton and jellyfish, glowing like submerged flashlights of green, blue and white. The 4,200-ton <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> rolled as much as 35 degrees during the dash down the gulf, causing equipment not lashed down to clatter across the decks, tipping over chairs in the officers' wardroom and spilling some off-duty sailors from their berths. The seas became so rough that the lookout stationed in a chair on the ship's `` bullnose'' was pulled in for fear he might be washed overboard.

Cpl. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 24, of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signals </ORGANIZATION> was buried next to his mother's grave at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Carshalton </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he was christened. Army comrades carried his casket, which was draped in the British flag and had Wood's army cap resting on it. A lone bugler sounded taps and an army firing party shot off three volleys in the air toward his grave. Wood and Cpl. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, 23, also of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signals </ORGANIZATION>, were attacked by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> procession when they drove up to the funeral cortege of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> last Saturday. An inscription on an unsigned card with a floral spray at <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s funeral read: `` Corporals <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> died heroes whilst amongst cowards God bless and rest in peace.'' In scenes that shocked television audiences around the world, members of the enraged crowd were seen to drag the two soldiers from their car, strip them and beat them with iron bars. The two were then taken to a nearby Gaelic football ground where <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen shot them to death.

 Fallen financier <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> on Thursday spent his first full day at a minimum-security prison nicknamed `` Club <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' where he was sent to serve a three-year sentence for insider trading. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s arrival Wednesday received more attention than anyone else's since White House aide H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> reported to serve time for his part in the Watergate scandal, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRoe </PERSON>, the warden's executive assistant. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, 51, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The earliest he can be released from prison is March 22, 1989. The federal prison camp is situated 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It is on 44,000 acres of heavily forested land. It has earned a reputation as a country club among prisons because it offers cable television, tennis, weightlifting, boccie, billiards and other activities to inmates. Jobs open to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> include work in the prison's furniture factory, dairy farm or cattle ranch. The once high-flying Wall Street speculator could also take a clerical job, <PERSON> LaRoe </PERSON> said. Pay ranges from 11 cents to $ 1.10 an hour. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has declined all contact with the news media and signed a statement requesting privacy, <PERSON> LaRoe </PERSON> said. He can not conduct business while in prison but can receive visitors for up to 50 hours a month. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> paid the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million fine in 1986 to settle civil charges of insider trading, the use of confidential information to profit in securities deals. He has cooperated extensively with federal investigators. The prison, designed to hold 450 inmates, houses 630. Overcrowding has forced double-bunking, <PERSON> LaRoe </PERSON> said.

 Testimony from a former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> attorney general that Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> broke the law in borrowing $ 80,000 from a `` protocol fund'' for his auto dealership was likened to a `` nuclear explosion'' by a lawmaker Thursday. The lawmaker, Republican Sen. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, said that according to former Attorney General <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON>'s analysis, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s action constituted a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 150,000 fine. <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> testified Wednesday that the $ 80,000 was public money and thus an illegal loan. The testimony from <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> came shortly before the prosecution rested Thursday on the second impeachment charge against the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor. <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> served under <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s predecessor, Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> `` We have seen some hand grenades go off here. We have seen some bombshells,'' West told the witness. `` But I think your testimony, if accurate, is either a nuclear explosion or at least devastating.'' `` Why do we not have the proper prosecutorial authorities investigating this?'' demanded West. Impeachment charges against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> include misusing or embezzling public funds through the loan in July from a fund intended to promote the image of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Senators, who are sitting as judge and jury, previously heard testimony on a charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by an aide. Still to be heard is a charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades. He also faces a May 17 recall election and an April 21 trial April 21 on felony charges that he concealed the $ 350,000 loan. The protocol fund was set up with $ 92,000 raised by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s inaugural ball State law barred its intended use to pay off campaign debts, and an agreement was reached to place it in a fund for promoting the image of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The prosecution has contended the fund was public money, while the defense has contended it was private. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will testify that his car dealership did not need the money and that his only motive was to increase the protocol fund by borrowing from it at higher interest than it was then receiving. As the defense opened its case on the loan Thursday, the governor's banker testified he would have given <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> an $ 80,000 loan with no collateral because he was a trusted customer. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagadorn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice president who said he has done business with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, his dealership and his brothers for 20 years, said the Mechams had good credit and had never defaulted on a loan. <PERSON> Hagadorn </PERSON> said that if he had been asked last summer, he would have given <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> an $ 80,000 loan without collateral and would have charged him interest of 9.5 or 10 percent. The governor borrowed from the protocol fund at 9 percent. Later, during cross-examination <PERSON> Hagadorn </PERSON> appeared stunned when prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> produced a letter showing that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in fact had defaulted on a loan from <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> for $ 101,905. <PERSON> Hagadorn </PERSON> conceded he might have thought twice about granting another loan if he had known. The bank's letter demanding payment was written on the same day that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> received the $ 80,000 loan from the protocol fund. Earlier, prosecution witness <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Colville </PERSON>, who said he has never done business with the governor, said he would have refused the loan based on financial records of <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Colville </PERSON>, a developer and mortgage banker, said the company was encumbered by liens for more than the business' appraised value. <PERSON> Colville </PERSON> cited liens for $ 3.7 million and said the most recent appraisal of the business put its value at $ 3.35 million. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Colville </PERSON> did not have the complete records, was misinterpreting the record he did have and did n't know the banking business well enough to give expert testimony. He also suggested the appraisal of <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> was too low. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former chief of staff, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON>, has testified he processed the $ 80,000 loan without checking the financial condition of <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>. Later in the day, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former special assistant, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, testified he thought the loan was `` stupid politically'' but not illegal. He said he had advised <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s chief of staff that the funds could not be construed as public funds. `` The argument I used then was these are not taxes; these are not fees; these are not licenses,'' he said. `` By no stretch of the imagination would be it be possible to construe these were public funds.'' Asked whether he thought <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s loan broke the law, <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said, `` I thought it was stupid politically, but I at no time considered it would be illegal.''

<HEAD>Study: Long-Term Use Does Not Increase Long-Term Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Long-term use of birth-control pills, even by women who began taking them as teen-agers, does not increase the risk of breast cancer, a new study of more than 9,000 women concludes. The findings were reported in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Previous studies disagreed over whether the pill increases the risk of breast cancer for women through middle age. Some researchers have suggested the conflicting conclusions might be the result of a long-term latent effect from early use. `` But we found no direct human evidence for such a latent effect,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON>, one of the study's authors. <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> was at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> when the study was conducted and now is with the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` This was a very, very large study ... and these data are immensely reassuring,'' he said. `` Nonetheless, everyone in the field believes additional large studies should be conducted in the 1990s, when the women we interviewed will be in their mid-60s.'' Early and prolonged use were defined as using oral contraceptives for at least six years before age 25, according to <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> and his colleagues, who were from the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. Researchers collected case histories and interviewed 4,714 women through age 54 who had developed breast cancer, then matched them with a control group of 4,540. `` We looked at many different facets, and broke the subjects into many different groups to isolate other factors,'' said <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON>. `` But the thing we consistently found is that women who used the pill for a long time, whether they were young when they began ... the relative risks were the same when compared to women who never used the pill when young.'' The study did not examine the effects of short-term use. For women in general, the risk of developing breast cancer during one's lifetime is about one in 10, <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> said. More than 50 million women worldwide are on the pill, he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> filed an `` energetic protest'' with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over what it said were new incursions this week by 350 Nicaraguan troops, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minstry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> later said the Nicaraguan troops had pulled out. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had denied that its soldiers penetrated Honduran territory. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said Honduran air force reconnaissance flights on Thursday found there were no longer Sandinista troops on the Honduran side of the border. `` The situation at the border apparently is calm,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telelphone. A ministry communique earlier Thursday said 300 heavily armed Sandinista soldiers crossed the border in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region, scene of fighting last week when Nicaraguan troops drove Contra rebels back into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The area is about 150 miles east of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The latest incursion occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday, about the same time as 50 other Sandinista soldiers entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espanol </LOCATION>, a village in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> province about two miles from the border, the communique said. It did not say if there was any combat. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s capital, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman was asked about the Honduran report. `` That's negative,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> declined Thursday to discuss the reported incursions. `` We continue to act with prudence,'' he said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> on Thursday for a meeting with other Central American foreign ministers. The government said last week there were up to 2,000 Sandinista troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and later said all had retreated back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Honduran jets raided Nicaraguan targets in the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region twice last week and <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said then that he would send more warplanes to attack Nicaraguan troops if they did not leave. That incursion and a request for help by <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> resulted in the emergency deployment of 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week. The Americans, who are conducting joint training exercises with Honduran soldiers, are expected to leave this country early next week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> for a clarification on reported comments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> about the reason <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers are in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In a news release late Wednesday, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said he wanted to know why <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities were saying the Americans were here to protect Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` These -LRB- American -RRB- troops that came to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were requested by the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> regarding the threat of incursions from the Sandinista army against the national territory ... and not for the principal objective of fortifying or protecting the Nicaraguan insurgents who are struggling against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> regime,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said. He proposed the creation of a peacekeeping force along the border region. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> refused to meet leaders of seven citizens organizations at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> Thursday. The leaders, whose groups are united under the umbrella <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, later met at a plaza where about 200 people had gathered and read a letter protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The letter said the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> meant `` that our country has been converted into a battle platform in the Central American region.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired missiles into each other's capitals Thursday and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> threatened to use chemical bombs in the war unless the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> punishes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using poison gas. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its troops advanced farther into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s northeastern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> province, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqi soldiers, in a week-old offensive. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied the claim. Shipping executives in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> said the captain of the 267,589-ton Friendship L supertanker reported a fire in the engine room, raising speculation the vessel may have been raided. They said a later report from the ship, which is on charter to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, reported the fire extinguished and denied there had been an attack. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> left an Islamic conference after other delegates criticized it for not heeding calls to accept a cease-fire in the war, which began in September 1980, and accused it of instigating bloody riots last year in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Dispatches from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said 13 people were killed and 68 wounded in two missile explosions in downtown <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said four missiles were fired at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. One victim was a woman who was breast-feeding her newborn baby in a hospital bed. The infant survived, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Nine houses were demolished in the attacks and two other children were among the victims, it said. The Iraqis said they launched six long-range missiles at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported 10 civilians killed and 100 wounded, and said the rockets hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has fired 42 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since March 15. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it has fired 16 missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and dozens of short-range rockets at other <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would use chemical weapons if no action was taken against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` We asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to send experts to the <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> region -LRB- in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> -RRB- to inspect the effects of the chemical weapons,'' he said on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. `` If the international organizations refuse to take any step to punish <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, we shall not remain idle. We have the technology to produce chemical weapons, and although we have not exploited this yet, we will not remain idle forever.'' He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has decided `` to punish the aggressor ourselves,'' renewing warnings that Iranian troops along the 733-mile border would launch an all-out offensive. `` At present we have forces and operational plans all over the battlefront, and should the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> refuse to take any step towards condemning the aggressor, we shall begin our operation,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> declared. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said 5,000 people were killed and 5,000 wounded when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped chemical bombs on <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khormal </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Dojaila </LOCATION>, three Kurdish towns captured by the Iranians last week. Most of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds live in the northeast and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> supports them in a struggle for autonomy. Western reporters flown to <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> by the Iranians earlier this week reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians, unmarked by wounds. They said many had died of asphyxiation, apparently caught unaware in their homes. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charled </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used chemical weapons, banned under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, and urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to protest. He called the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> action `` a particularly grave violation.'' <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Iranian planes Thursday inadvertently violated Turkish airspace and dropped two bombs over southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> near the Harbur border post, breaking windows but causing no casualties. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> confirmed the area was bombed but said the planes' nationality was not known yet. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranian jets were raiding northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> when they strayed over <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The guns were silent Thursday, the first day of an agreement between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels that Nicaraguans pray will bring peace for the first time since 1981. One man called it a miracle. In three days of negotiations that resulted in agreement Wednesday night, both sides called it <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s last chance for peace. The formal, 60-day cease-fire is to begin April 1, but they agreed to extend a truce declared for the talks. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to brief Mexican President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on the agreement, told a news conference `` direct negotiation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is more necessary than ever'' to ensure a truce in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rejected previous Sandinista calls for direct talks, saying the Nicaraguan government and the rebels must negotiate first. `` Now that we have ... a signed document with the Contras,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said, `` we are disposed to begin direct negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, dozens of women marched to <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION> on Thursday, gathered in the city's main Catholic church and `` lighted candles to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'' to mark the agreement, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who owns a shoe store and has three nephews in the army, said: `` This is the most important thing that has occcured since 1979 when the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dictatorship was overthrown.'' <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and staunch critic of the government, called the pact `` a miracle.'' In <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the cease-fire offers `` a new and firm hope that all Central Americans can live in peace.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for devising the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace agreement that calls for cease-fires in the region's wars During the negotiations at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, on the Costa Rican border 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made a suprise visit and said it was time `` to bury once and for all the military confrontation.'' Rebel leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told journalists at the meeting: `` It is not just a chance to achieve peace and harmony, but the only chance.'' Leaders of the Sandinistas and the U.S.-sponsored Contras stood side-by-side on a makeshift dais Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, sang the national anthem together and signed the cease-fire. During the three days, both sides retreated from hard positions, especially the <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON>, who stand to gain the most from an agreement that would virtually end the insurgency. The Contras agreed not to accept military aid and to receive non-lethal supplies exclusively from neutral organizations. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which has financed the rebels since they began fighting in late 1981, has been seeking congressional approval of more funds. Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regional peace plan signed Aug. 7 by all five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents _ ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoring democratic freedoms. Opponents of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> say the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised democracy when they overthrew rightist President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979, but instead established a Marxist regime. Although the cease-fire does not begin officially until April 1, both sides said they would continue the battlefield truce they declared on Monday, the first day of negotiations. Beginning next Monday, also in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, negotiators will draw the lines of areas to which rebels will go during the first two weeks of the official cease-fire. Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying down their weapons, so that may be another subject taken up in next week's meetings. In past negotiations, the rebels insisted on keeping their weapons until provisions of any accord were carried out. Also not mentioned is a reduction of the 80,000-member regular armed forces, largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The government claims to have 300,000 people under arms, including army, reserves and civilian militia. Gradual amnesty is provided for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 3,300 political prisoners, beginning Sunday. The deal also guarantees `` unrestricted freedom of expression,'' demanded by the rebels, and permits all exiles to return home. With verification that the Contras have moved into the truce zones, they can send up to eight delegates to participate in national talks now under way in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as part of the regional peace plan, the agreement says. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed that the `` issues related to military service will be dealt with.'' Contra negotiators had insisted forced military service be ended. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government granted a rebel request that compliance with the agreement be verified by a commission formed by Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and the secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. Both were witnesses to the talks and it was <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> who read the final document aloud. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> had mediated previous negotiations outside the country.

 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has fallen on hard times since his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory 45 days ago, will quit the presidential race unless he scores an upset victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> this weekend, aides said Thursday. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, headed for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> expecting to pad his huge lead on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, `` My mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time.'' But the scramble was already on to pick up supporters who would be freed if he withdrew. `` There's no question there are some union leaders who are now supporting <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> who would find <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the most attractive of the alternatives,'' said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at an appearance in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who is in fourth place in the Democratic delegate count, just ahead of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, spoke of getting `` back in the ballgame.'' Among the Republicans, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s main rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, that her husband now has merely a `` long shot'' chance, but she added, `` He's got the grit and determination needed to keep him in the running.'' She said neither she nor her husband have discussed the possibility that one of them might be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate for the general election. `` I'm really not seeking to be on the ticket. I'm going 12 hours a day just trying to carry <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s message,'' she said Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, holding a commanding lead in the battle for Republican convention delegates, was traveling to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, saying he was taking nothing for granted in the primary there next Tuesday. However, public opinion polls give him a big lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grew up and where his father once served as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference that it would be premature to discuss pardons for any of the defendants in the Iran-Contra affair, and that he did not think fallout from the arms-for-hostages deal would hurt his campaign. `` If it was going to have an impact, I think it would have before now,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll suggested Thursday night that a general election matchup of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be a close race. In the poll, with a 3 percentage-point margin of error, 46 percent picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 45 percent chose <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who did the best of any of the Democrats against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the poll. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, campaigning in English and Spanish. He denounced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, said he favored a one-year extension in the deadline for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty and said when asked about the possibility of a Hispanic running mate, `` Tal vez. ... Vamos a ver -LRB- Perhaps. ... We'll see -RRB-.'' Democratic rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, telling the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Legislature that if he wins the nomination and election, `` As president, I will meet with the heads of state where drugs are grown ... and stop the flow of drugs.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s spokesman said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, a well-known media consultant who has previously worked for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, had been hired to handle the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator's advertising for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, just a few weeks ago the victor in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses, now lags behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in delegates to the national convention. He trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in public opinion polls preceding Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. He said Thursday in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, `` Rather than trying to guess all the different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think we have to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide what other steps should be taken.'' Still, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> told a radio interviewer in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, `` I think <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> has to come in first or a real strong second to remain in the race. ... If we do n't do well here, we will not be able to continue.'' The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman has only until Tuesday to file for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, and one aide, commenting only on condition he not be named, suggested that it was important for the congressman to retain that office in order to raise money. His campaign has been strapped for cash for weeks. Money was in the news for several other current and former candidates on Thursday: _ <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign confirmed Thursday it borrowed more than $ 1.4 million early this month, putting up collateral that included future matching funds and a personal guarantee by the candidate himself The move followed a report in the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessean </LOCATION> newspaper about the details of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s borrowing. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, now that he is no longer a presidential candidate, can use leftover 1988 campaign funds toward retiring his lingering debt of about $ 1 million from his 1984 race _ The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to grant federal matching funds to political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, even though he is standing trial on a charge relating to alleged financial irregularity in his 1984 campaign <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is running as a Democrat, although the national party has disavowed his candidacy. The Democrats, including <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, were concentrating on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which has its primary on April 5. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spent the first part of the week trading charges with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on foreign-trade policy, a major issue in a state heavily dependent on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto sales, was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but planned to spend all day Friday in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> endorsed him on Thursday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s aides said he had no campaign events scheduled Thursday. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, meanwhile, urged 700 supporters in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> to turn out in force at local Republican precinct meetings to select delegates to the state and natonal GOP conventions. Noting that Easter is ten days away, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the press declared his candidacy dead after Super Tuesday. `` I do n't think they are aware of the Resurrection,'' he said. `` In the next few weeks, as these caucuses unfold, we are going to win the majority of delegates in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' predicted <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who was beaten soundly by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his home state's non-binding primry on March 8.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> belittled Soviet technology for detecting nuclear missiles aboard ships and snubbed an invitation this week to see the process before the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. During three days of pre-summit talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> offered to let the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> participate in an experiment to test the system in April. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered some new proposals of its own regarding space-based weapons systems. One was the exemption of spy satellites from treaty restrictions, an idea that the Soviets apparently found interesting. `` We think they're useful to our security,'' a senior administration official said Thursday. `` They think they're useful to theirs.'' The other idea was that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators make a special effort to define space-based testing and deployment. `` Then we could also work on the idea of having confidence-building measures or what we call predictability measures which could reduce the difficulties between the two sides with respect to other types of systems that might be tested or other kinds of devices,'' the official said. Details of that proposal have not been settled, but officials said the most likely approach would be to allow only a limited number of space weapons prototypes to be tested in a region of space where they would have little value in an actual missile defense. The two proposals were intended to resolve the contentious battle over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, known also as Star Wars, which is possibly the biggest obstacle to reaching agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Wednesday that the two issues would be negotiated separately but that agreements in the two areas should be `` completed more or less at the same time so the two things move in parallel.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long said that the two issues should be handled separately. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, meanwhile, said Wednesday night that `` of course there is'' a linkage between resolving the defense in space issues and the treaty to reduce long-range strategic weapons. `` There will be no treaty on the 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive arms if there is no observance of the ABM treaty, at least for an agreed period of time,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. The Soviets, as well as some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, say SDI would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> hailed the system to detect nuclear missiles on ships as a technological milestone in missile detection that would help the superpowers achieve their goal of a summit agreement to cut long-range nuclear arsenals. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, however, `` we're not interested'' because the system does n't detect nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles, as the Soviets claim. `` The Soviets could not explain how this experiment would tell us more than we already know,'' the official said. `` Such technology would not be effective under realistic conditions.'' It could not, for example, tell the difference between nuclear warheads and atomic propulsion systems used on many surface ships, the official said. `` Our people know a great deal about the ideas that the Soviets have advanced, and we've looked into it carefully,'' the official said. When they agreed in principle last December to hold a springtime summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said they wanted to sign an agreement to cut the numbers of long-range nuclear missiles and bombers by 30 percent to 50 percent. With little progress _ notably on the verification issues _ during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for three days this week, neither side predicted the agreement would be ready in time. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, moreover, that until the negotiators prove they can verify elimination of the various types of weapons involved, they wo n't know which ones will be covered in a treaty. Another official, noting that the two nations also disagree on such explosive issues as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and human rights warned against expecting `` easy solutions'' to U.S.-Soviet problems. The official described the most recent talks as `` grueling,'' notably in the 11 hours of discussion on the regional hot spots. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sought to dispel suggestions that the summit meeting _ in the twilight of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency _ would be a ceremonial and symbolic visit short on substantive accomplishments During <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` we made enough progress to keep going and presumably we will make more in the days ahead,'' the spokesman told reporters. During the talks this week both sides `` faced all the tough problems'' and left no confusion about where both sides stand, he said. The summit `` will be well prepared; there will be substance to discuss; there will be good prospects for success,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 U.S.-Soviet talks on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> were extended Thursday while Arabs and Israelis continued to delay a response to an American plan for negotiations. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, a specialist in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, met with Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> despite what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials described as a fundamental difference in the two superpowers' positions. The Soviets are seeking an active role in any peace conference, while Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Wednesday night he did not want any interference in <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. `` It's quite clear the Soviet concept of how to go about this is really sharply different from ours,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters after three days of talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also objects to an active Soviet role, but King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is seeking Soviet participation in the negotiations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> behind to continue the discussions with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and flew home to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, meanwhile, completed talks in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to report to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that despite having no direct reply from the <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> or Arabs to his plan to open negotiations by May 1 he would not give up. `` We will continue to work with the parties directly involved, and we will continue to try, in every way we can, to find our way to the direct, face-to-face negotiations that we believe are the only way in which you can really resolve these issues,'' he said. `` Now how to get there is difficult, and we will continue to push for and, at the same time, maintain the limitations on the kind of conference we've called for. And, we'll just have to see how that goes.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` nobody seems to be ready to climb on our bandwagon, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On the other hand, everybody wants to keep it rolling, so we'll keep it rolling.'' Asked if he planned to return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he had not made a decision. He said his lengthy talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had made it difficult for him `` to come up for air'' and evaluate reports from the region. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> presented his plan for negotiations to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders three weeks ago and asked for a reply by mid-March. `` I am ready to go to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> anytime it seems as though there is even a remote chance of being constructive,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have to have a high probability.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan excludes the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> from proposed negotiations but provides for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Meantime Thursday, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations `` it's a tough question but I do n't think it's insuperable'' to find a credible Palestinian leader to participate without driving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> away from the bargaining table. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> added that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` remains for Palestinians, by and large, the only leadership they accept.'' But he did not say a Palestinian participant would necessarily have to be a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative. Five demonstrators wearing T-shirts reading `` Stop <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' stood silently against a hearing room wall throughout most of <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s testimony and left without incident after about an hour. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said `` it would be the dangerous to the peace process'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce its annual payment of $ 2.2 billion in military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest its handling of Palestinian unrest on the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said any such aid reduction might be interpreted in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> capitals as a weakening of ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and might invite a renewal of military assaults against the Jewish state. Under questioning, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had assurances from `` the highest levels'' in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that the medium-range missiles that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recently agreed to provide to the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> contain conventional and not nuclear warheads. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions that the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has been conducting unusually intensive low-level bombing practice runs at the same time <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is digging in its new missiles. The newspaper quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials as saying that the bombing could be in preparation for a pre-emptive strike against the missiles, as a senior Israeli official warned Sunday. However, the officials said they had no hard evidence that an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> strike was imminent. Satellite photography and other intelligence have revealed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been flying F-15 fighter bombers in attack profiles and that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been building shelters for its missiles, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has sent a warning through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it will retaliate with its surviving missiles with a range of up to 1,500 miles if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> tries to bomb its missiles, diplomatic sources told the newspaper.

 Nearly all of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s police officers and firefighters called in sick Thursday to protest a 2 percent pay raise, then ignored back-to-work orders from a judge and the City Council. Less than an hour before an emergency council meeting Thursday afternoon, <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> issued a temporary injunction ordering firefighters to work immediately and police to report at their next scheduled shift. The missing police officers did not report for the 3 p.m. shift, however, and firefighters also refused to report. `` We just want an honest living,'' said Fire Department Lt. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavender </PERSON>, who was on duty at the city's station No. 1. `` We're going backward in pay. The `` blue flu'' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s capital and largest city began Wednesday night when officers began refusing to show up for work. At the 6 a.m. shift change, 16 of 17 uniformed police officers and 42 of 44 firefighters scheduled to report failed to show up. Firemen and police officers who were on duty overnight were retained on overtime, giving the fire department a full complement of men, and process servers took return-to-work orders to the absent personnel Thursday afternoon, said Mayor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> declared a state of civil emergency earlier in the day, saying the policemen and firefighters must return because `` the safety of the citizens of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> is not a bargaining chip.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnett </PERSON> told an emergency meeting of the city council that only 13 officers, covering all grades, showed up Thursday morning, `` most of them supervisors.'' He said only three cars were on patrol Thursday morning, with two officers in each car. <PERSON> Garnett </PERSON> also told the council members that since Wednesday night 68 officers and 42 firemen had called in sick as of 9 a.m. The city budget, approved Monday night, includes appropriations for 165 policemen, 147 firefighters and 10 paramedics for the city of 63,000. <PERSON> Garnett </PERSON> said the firefighters who were on the job had been there since 8 a.m. Wednesday and were tiring quickly. `` I do n't know how long they can stay there,'' he said. The council unanimously suspended the city's sick-leave policy, meaning that any more officers calling in sick would have to have a doctor's excuse to get paid for any additional days absent from work. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, facing his first crisis since taking over as mayor four months ago, said it was n't illegal to call the council into emergency session on less than four hours' notice and suspend sections of the city code. The code requires two days' notice of emergency meetings. No police or firefighters picketed Thursday, but about 20 police wives marched in front of City Hall and carried signs. Passing motorists honked their horns in support and some _ aware that patrols were down _ took the opportunity to run red lights. `` We have several police officers that qualify for welfare,'' said police wife <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockard </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said his department would provide assistance to the city only `` if there's a murder or something.'' `` We do n't have the manpower to work the city,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. State police Superintendent W.F. <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> had asked the governor for state police help. `` We will answer calls on a priority basis to the very best of our ability,'' <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said. The police officers believe their 2 percent raise will be eaten up by a higher deductible on their health insurance and an increase in the city's incinerator fee from $ 30 to $ 85. `` It's not easy to raise the incinerator fee. But without a raise in the incinerator fee, we did n't have money to increase salaries,'' said <PERSON> Councilwoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. Under the budget approved this week, salaries for uniformed police officers range from $ 27,673 for a captain with 20 years' experience to $ 18,589 for a patrol officer with three years' Mayoral Aide <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said that no raises had been given this year but that police and firefighters had received a 3 percent raise in the 1986-87 fiscal year and raises totaling 8 percent over the past five years. By comparison, at the <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where deputies have gotten raises totaling 25 percent over the past 3 -LCB- years, a deputy with three years' experience will make $ 21,720 as of July 1, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. City firefighters' pay ranges from $ 27,673 for an assistant fire chief with 20 years' experience to $ 18,409 for a first-year firefighter.

 <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> at the party conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said Wednesday.

 A state appeals court Wednesday rejected as too low a $ 3,500 damage award to a salesman left with a perpetual frown after an auto accident. `` Such scars are of a greater consequence to a 24-year-old single man who has chosen a career in sales than that amount reflects,'' a two-judge panel ruled in ordering a new trial on the issue of damages for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tronolone </PERSON>. Tronolone was a passenger in a car that struck a utility pole in <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. A jury found the driver, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, negligent and awarded Tronolone $ 750, but the judge at the trial found it inadequate and raised it to $ 3,500. Tronolone appealed.

 Gunmen ambushed and killed on Wednesday the security chief for a newspaper that had urged the government not to back down in its war on drug traffickers, police said. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was hit by five bullets fired by three men on motorcycles, police said in a news release. His 10-month-old daughter was grazed by a bullet and hospitalized in satisfactory condition, police said. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile ordered the temporary suspension of arrest orders for five members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, a group said to dominate cocaine trafficking in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The suspension of the arrest orders Wednesday is almost certain to bring an angry reaction from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, who have begun to question the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's position on rounding up drug traffickers. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> and family were waiting for a taxi near their home when three men on motorcycles opened fire with pistols and a submachine gun, the police said. His wife was not hurt. Police said they did n't know who was responsible for <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON>'s killing <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> was chief of security for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, which has urged the government not to give in to drug traffickers. He also served as security chief for the newspaper's publisher, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was elected mayor on March 13 <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> takes office June 1. On March 10, two bombs were thrown from a speeding car into the entryway of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION>. A guard threw the bombs back into the street and a passer-by was killed. In November, gunmen shot up <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>'s home. The gunmen apparently were trying to kidnap <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> in an attempt to get the government to suspend extraditions of Colombians to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug trafficking charges. Many drug traffickers live and process cocaine base in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Colombian drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an attorney general, 21 judges, two newspaper editors and scores of policemen and soldiers in the last four years. The suspension of arrest orders for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel was announced by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buitrago </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in January ordered the arrest of alleged <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel members <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and three brothers, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buitrago </PERSON>, making the announcement during an interview by the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, said the arrest orders were being suspended while the government studies possible charges in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> against the five men. <PERSON> Buitrago </PERSON> said the suspension of the arrest orders is temporary until the council decides if it will permanently cancel the orders. It could be up to two months before the council makes its final decision. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s wife and 25 of his guards appeared before a judge in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> after a shootout at <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s home near that northwest Colombian city. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> apparently was at home when the shootout began but escaped. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is among the world's biggest cocaine traffickers. He is wanted for trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Army troops surrounded the <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> home Tuesday, setting off a sophisticated alarm system of sirens and flashing lights, the army's 4th Brigade headquarters in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> said in a news release. A gunbattle ensued, and one <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> guard was wounded, the army said. The army found numerous guns, lots of ammunition and sophisticated communications equipment, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, was released by the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> judge, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting a source with the attorney general's office.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> history professors said Wednesday that government documents indicate <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officers attempted to kill <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> revolutionary <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> by poisoning in 1916. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> presented the findings in a paper submitted at a monthly meeting of the Latin American studies forum at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> State. They said the attempt came during an American expedition into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in pursuit of Villa and his men. The expedition followed a raid by Villa on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> that left 17 American soldiers and civilians dead. The attempt was made in the town of <LOCATION> Jimenez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, four months after the raid on <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. The plot called for two Japanese men who were employed as secret agents for the American government to put poison in a cup of coffee intended for <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, the professors said. The two agents posed as peddlers and wanted <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> to think they were sympathetic to his revolutionary cause. Villa foiled the assassination attempt by pouring part of the coffee into another man's cup, the professors said. The fate of the man into whose cup Villa poured the coffee was not known, the professors said. The poison was supposed to be odorless and tasteless and cause death three days after ingestion. Historians consider the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> raid a turning point in the Mexican revolution because it rallied American public opinion against <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> and his men. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pershing </PERSON> led the retaliatory expedition. `` We ca n't prove it but there is no doubt in my mind that he knew'' of the plot, <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> said. The professors said that while there were official inquiries into the alleged plot, <PERSON> Pershing </PERSON> denied any knowledge of it. The assassination attempt, according to the professors, was covered up.

 The telling and retelling of a story of rape and murder from various points of view makes for little suspense, but good acting and direction keep up interest in an off-Broadway revival of the 1959 stage version of `` Rashomon.'' The play by <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanin </PERSON> is based on the 1951 Japanese movie of the same name and on stories by <PERSON> Ryunosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Akutagawa </PERSON> published in 1915. It is the story of a samurai and his wife who encounter a bandit in the forest. The wife is raped and the samurai is found dead. But the circumstances vary depending on who does the telling. Knowing the rape and death will be depicted several times, the audience can focus on how each person tells the story to paint himself or herself to best advantage. The husband's ghost, conjured up in a courtroom, tells of suicide, while the bandit and the wife both confess to murder. The bandit figures he'll be executed anyway; the wife thinks she'll be pardoned. It would shame them more to be publicly revealed as lacking in the personality they've presented to the world than to proclaim that they were driven to kill. The final version, told by a woodcutter who witnessed the encounter from a hiding place, is hilarious as husband and wife bicker and the honorable samurai and daring bandit are afraid to fight. The entire cast is <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> in this first major revival of the play since it played on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> in 1959 starring <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Willman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Homolka </PERSON>. The cast includes <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON> as the bandit who turns somersaults during swordfights; <PERSON> Kiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, who can take on many womanly aspects depending whose story she is acting; <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, who usually is bound and gagged as the husband; <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, the woodcutter, and <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sesma </PERSON>, a priest. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leong </PERSON> expertly directed fights and movement. <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> Albergo </PERSON>'s setting is a forest clearing, alabaster with bamboo-leaf tracings, with the Rashomon Gate at one side. The set enhances the openness with which director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalfin </PERSON> places this `` Rashomon'' before the audience. The play will run through May 8.

Last year, the government paid around $ 700 million to service its foreign debt. Officials in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> say part of the reason for this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation's economic slump is the cut in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quota for Dominican sugar, this nation's most important export.

 Watching the opening credits on the season finale of CBS' `` Designing Women'' Monday night will be something akin to witnessing the final out in a no-hitter. When the `` written by'' card goes up on the screen, it will say `` <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON>'' _ just as it has on every one of the 22 episodes this season. <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> is the first person in television history to single-handedly write every episode of a show for a whole season, a feat for which she has been nominated for inclusion in The Guinness Book of World Records. She said in a telephone interview that she wrote each script in a marathon session on the Sunday before shooting began the following week. `` We've never been one script ahead, which is kind of harrowing,'' she said. `` It's kind of like walking a tightrope each week without a net. This is what would give the network a heart attack.'' Not only did she write all the scripts, but all the scripts were unusually good _ not formula sitcom fare, but thoughtful essays on such diverse subjects as AIDS or the ordination of women. In Monday's episode, `` Reservations for Eight,'' the women are stranded in a ski lodge with their boyfriends for what turns out to be a tour-de-force battle of the sexes. <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> says no matter what subject she takes on, the network has not interfered. `` They have never, ever told me anything that I can not do. They have never disapproved of any subject I've wanted to do. I just decide what I want to write about and I write it. There has been zero censorship. `` It's 23 minutes of prime-time television every week to address any topic I want,'' she said. `` I've tried to be responsible and fair, but I'd be lying if I did n't say I put my personal opinions in. I do get my own propaganda in, but that's what I think makes it interesting. My big complaint about television is the characters are too homogenized. You do n't know where they go to church or how they feel about issues. Our women all are very, very opinionated.'' <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Poplar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bluff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, in a ideologically rambunctious family, where, she recalled with a laugh, `` If you did n't have an opinion you got sent to your room.'' `` I like stirring things up. Everyone in my family is an attorney. My grandfather, all my uncles, my brother, my father. Even when I was little, he -LRB- her father -RRB- would come in and say, ` You know, girls are n't all that smart.' I would cry and say, ` They are, too!' He knew what he was doing. He would always make me defend my positions.'' <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, a one-time high school football coach from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, are co-executive producers of `` Designing Women,'' and <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> directs many of the episodes. <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> created the show specifically for <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dixie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delta </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, the latter two of whom starred in <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON>'s viciously funny but short-lived `` Filthy Rich.'' With `` Designing Women,'' <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> aimed to make a show about smart Southern women. The show was a hit as soon as it premiered last season, though <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> almost killed it by repeatedly changing its time period, sparking an almost unprecedented outcry by fans. The show has finally settled into Monday night. <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON>, whose first script, for `` M-A-S-H,'' won an Emmy, never doubted that a show about a bunch of wise-cracking Southern belles would succeed. `` I'm one of these people that's always optimistic,'' she said. `` I always think everything's going to work out just like I want it to.'' She laughed, then added, `` That makes it all the more poignant when I'm flattened out like a cartoon character when the steamroller has run over me.'' <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> expects to hire a writing staff for next season, since she and her husband are producing a new series for <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION>, and she is writing the script for <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s new movie about an all-woman band in the 1930s. She said <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> had seen `` Designing Women,'' called her up and asked, `` Can you make my mouth move like <PERSON> Dixie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s?''

<HEAD>Infrastructure Problems Loom for Los Angeles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's second-largest city, with its promised-land image of youth and opportunity, is starting to show its age. The effects of too many years of too much growth are increasingly evident in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' streets and freeways, sewers and landfills. While in many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities the challenge is just to replace public works as they wear out, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> faces the added pressures of California-style growth. The stress has occasionally popped the city's overworked sewer system, causing raw sewage discharges into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and prompting Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> last fall to propose restrictions on the number of new sewer hookups. On the region's streets and freeways, daily trips will increase 42 percent by the year 2010, according to a local planning agency. Motorists' average speed of 31 mph systemwide today is expected to drop to 11 mph. And without more landfills, city and county officials say <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> will produce thousands of tons more garbage daily than it can properly dispose. `` Our infrastructure has reached the point that it requires massive infusions of resources to maintain, or to increase its capacity to deal with the population growth,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, president of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has been lulled into a false sense of security,'' said <PERSON> Delwin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biagi </PERSON>, an engineer who joined the city's public works department 17 years ago and who now heads the bureau of sanitation The city population is expected to swell 16 percent, to 3.6 million, by 2010, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>. In the surrounding six-county area, the predicted growth is 47 percent, to 18.3 million people in 22 years. `` Over the next 25 years, we see a 50 percent increase in housing and jobs in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Riga </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> SCAG </ORGANIZATION> transportation planner. `` That means it's going to cause some big problems with our transportation system. It's already overburdened. We know that. The question is what are we going to do about it?'' <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>'s agency, which predicted the growth in traffic, also prepared a study in February that sets out three alternatives, ranging in cost from $ 42 million to $ 110 million, to alleviate congestion: by locating jobs nearer to housing through growth management, or changing driving patterns by carpooling or re-scheduling office hours, or constructing new highways and other facilities. However, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials say the problems are so intractable that doubling the number of freeways would not appreciably reduce traffic. Moreover, a statewide study done by the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Infrastructure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> indicates the pricetag would be billions _ not millions _ of dollars The task force estimated the state's public works needs at $ 78 billion _ and projected a revenue shortfall of $ 50 billion to meet the demand. Increasing traffic and other effects of growth have stoked the political fires of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' anti-growth movement, said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, an adjunct faculty member at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, who heads a group called Not Yet <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` All the people who support slow-growth want to make sure that the infrastructure will still be there,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> said. `` The system is hemorrhaging and they're coming up with very expensive Band-Aids.'' Her group supported <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanter </PERSON> last year, and the growth-control advocate was elected. Ms. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> herself plans to run for a council seat in 1989. Local concerns reflect a nationwide problem. Last August, a study of public works funding done for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> concluded: `` As the federal government shifted priorities away from infrastructure financing, new federal laws have mandated state and local compliance with new requirements for water pollution control, clean drinking water and the cleanup of hazardous wastes.'' Another federal study concluded that as much as $ 90 billion a year is needed to pay for all types of public works repairs nationwide. The problems it identified _ neglected and dilapidated bridges, water systems, highways, mass transit systems and other facilities _ are consistent with what is happening in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Supervisor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON> said recently. Yet <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> leaders postponed capital improvements to the sewer system for more than a decade while arguing over compliance with federal clean water standards. `` The city was running away from its responsibilities,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, president of an environmental group called Heal the Bay. The dispute ended when the city agreed to stop dumping its treated sewage sludge offshore and to build a secondary wastewater treatment facility. The primary wastewater plant was built in 1950. The cost of compliance will be more than $ 2.3 billion over the next 10 years, officials said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> also faces a looming crisis over its garbage, which is thrown away at the rate of 45,000 tons per day in the metropolitan area, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, manager of the city's solid waste task force. The city itself, which generates 18,000 tons per day of that total, already trucks 5,400 tons per day to outlying county landfills, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We have to find additional landfill space and we have to start recycling efforts,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` That's all we've got.'' If no landfills are established, the excess garbage will amount to 6,400 tons per day by 1992, and 50,000 tons per day by the year 2000, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. By 1997, there will be no landfills remaining within the city. `` We have n't been able to site a new landfill since 1974,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, listing five ill-fated proposals, including trash-to-energy incineration plants. `` The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is very aware of the situation. They just have no clear-cut plan as to what they're going to do.''

 At age 15, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> has appeared in a feature-length movie, has learned to hunt and to ride an off-road motorcycle, and has traveled and made a lot of friends. `` If I die today, I feel like I've had a good life,'' says the boy, who suffers from progeria, a rare condition that has caused his diminutive body to age far beyond his years. Most children with progeria die before reaching their teens, usually of a stroke or heart-related cause. Experts say the condition strikes one in 8 million children, and only about 70 cases have ever been reported. Only 15 or so people are alive today who suffer from the disease, thought to be caused by a genetic pituitary disorder, according to <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>. And yet, except for the fact that he does n't go to school, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> tries to be a typical teen-ager. His life is an ongoing defiance of the odds and medical convention about his condition. `` When they first told my parents about progeria, they said I would n't live more than a month,'' <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> says of the time at age 4 when doctors finally put a name on the condition that had hardened his skin and caused his hair to fall out. `` They keep pushing it back. When I was 5, they said 7. When I was 7, they said 10. When I was 10, they said 12. Now I'm 15, and they say 18.'' It's gotten so that <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> does n't listen anymore and visits a physician just once a year for a checkup. `` I feel fine. I feel great,'' he said in a recent interview in his rural <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> home. Two years ago, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> suffered congestive heart failure brought on by progeria, but now his only disability seems to be that sunshine or other bright light hurts his eyes. Still, he did n't let the sun keep him from going on a church-sponsored youth trip to a water park in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 100 miles away, or from being outside with friends. He simply wears a cap. As he nears his 16th birthday on June 30, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> looks forward to a rite of passage: obtaining a driver's license and a pickup truck _ `` a jet black <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> hardbody,'' he says. Extenders attached to the controls of his mother's van helped <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, who is only 3 feet tall, learn to drive. But like many of his friends, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> drives his own four-wheel motorcycle through the piney woods that surround his home. `` Just about everybody has motorcycles and four-wheelers,'' <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> explains. `` There's a hill everybody goes to called ` The Mountain.' It's the highest point in <LOCATION> Gregg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and from there you can look down on <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>. It's real nice.'' Over pizza, two of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s friends, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, talked about rock concerts they've attended with him in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. They teased him about new cowboy boots and about not attending school. `` I'd stay in school just to be around everybody,'' <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, who would be in 10th grade, does n't attend classes: `` I quit after seventh grade. I got in too much trouble. I did n't like being told to shut up. When his friends are in school, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> spends his days working on his four-wheeler, hunting in season -LRB- he has bagged five deer and 16 raccoons -RRB-, watching soap operas, listening to pop musicians <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Whitesnake </ORGANIZATION>, and playing with his toddler brother, <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>. He mows yards for neighbors and occasionally works in his mother <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>'s income tax preparation office and his stepfather <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>'s business machine outlet. `` There's always a way to make money,'' <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> said, adding that his favorite way would be to work in show business again. He played a gentle old visitor from space in `` The Aurora Encounter,'' a 1985 feature-length movie, and now envisions a part in a credit card commercial: `` Do you know me?'' he would ask. `` I'm not an alien who visited <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in the 19th century just to be killed by a frightened <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger. That's just a movie role I played.'' Because of the movie part, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> says he became `` somebody'' rather than `` somebody different.'' `` People before always used to notice me as somebody different,'' <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> said. `` Now I go somewhere and people recognize me as <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, someone who played in a movie.'' The role is one of two experiences in recent years that <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> said built his self-esteem. The second was meeting <PERSON> Fransie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geringer </PERSON>, the progeric son of a South African coal miner, in 1982. It was the first time either boy had met someone else with progeria. They met at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> later visited <PERSON> Fransie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Orkney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Now, the two have linked with about 15 other progeric children and many of them started attending an annual reunion a few years ago. Of the progeric children who attend, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> said he is the oldest and possibly the healthiest. A Canadian girl, six months older than <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, died recently, according to his mother. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and I have had a nice life, but there are times when you start feeling sorry for yourself,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> said. `` If someone says, ` I know how you feel,' well, it's nice, but at the reunions, other parents really do know how I feel.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> takes pictures of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> as an infant, when he looked like any normal baby, to the reunions to show the other parents. `` They look at <LOCATION> Mickey </LOCATION> and I and see what's ahead. They really ca n't imagine what their children will be like. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> being so outgoing gives them hope.'' Progeric children should consider themselves very lucky if they live to age 20, Dr. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> said. Still, when the conversation turns to mortality, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> speaks without hesitation of his Baptist upbringing. `` I think I'll live as long as God wants me to live. Everybody's got to die sometime.

 Ask Raymond A. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> what his childhood ambitions were and it's unlikely that running a couple of arms companies, practicing law, accounting, teaching or banking would have appeared on his list. Yet <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON>, who set out to become an engineer and now heads a small bank in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and one of the nation's most powerful banking trade groups, has done all of them with varying degrees of success. `` I do n't think of myself as ambitious. I'm just interested in many things,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> grocer. `` If you ever get the idea you'd like to try something different, do it.'' Even now the 63-year-old <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> continues to try on different hats, so to speak. As current president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents many of the nation's biggest commercial banks, he hobnobs with the likes of former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> and other prominent bankers and has lobbied vigorously in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> for broader banking powers. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> is one of the most outspoken opponents of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separates investment banking from commercial banking, and a similar `` mini Glass-Steagall'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He believes the laws eventually will be repealed and envisions banks offering a wider range of financial services in the next five years, like a one-stop shopping network. If it were up to <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON>, banks would be permitted to sell insurance or underwrite corporate securities but those involved in risky businesses would n't be eligible for deposit insurance. At <ORGANIZATION> Tompkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a community bank in a college town where <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> started out as a director in the mid 1960s, the small-town granderfatherly image emerges. There, the bank president of 15 years meets with the local Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the chamber of commerce, two of the many community groups in which he's been involved <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> knows many of his customers on a first-name basis, and he's been known to accommodate depositers in need of emergency cash long after closing hours, something unheard of in a big city. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON>, a well-dressed man with whitish hair and a pleasant smile, recalled his first loan at <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> came out of his own pocket. `` I had a young woman who asked me if she could borrow $ 20 to buy a dress and get a job at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- University -RRB-. I said, ` A bank does n't loan you $ 20,' so I gave her the $ 20 myself,'' he said in a recent interview. `` She bought the dress, came back and showed it to me.'' The woman got the job and repaid the loan $ 5 every two weeks _ `` with 6 percent interest,'' he said, betraying his stait-laced banker's streak. `` I never realized I would be a banker. These are things I'm able to do that make me feel so good,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> said `` Lawyers -LRB- for instance -RRB- do n't make things happen. They sometimes prevent things from happening.'' His career as a lawyer spanned about 10 years and followed his stint as a certified public accountant, which overlapped his teaching and accounting job at the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, shortly after World War II. Running two arms companies, <ORGANIZATION> Poly-Choke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Ithaca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, came somewhere in between. As a young lawyer he specialized in mergers and acquisitions, but he said he also arranged a few overseas adoptions of babies abandoned during World War II. The pay back then for accounting or law was n't great, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> said, and with a wife and three children to support, including an infant daughter struggling with a birth defect, he found himself living from paycheck to paycheck. His job at Poly-Choke, which specialized in customized gun barrels and whose customers included Gen. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, `` finally gave us enough money so we could afford a two-bedroom apartment instead of one.'' That job eventually led to <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gun </LOCATION>, where he served as president from 1966 to 1968. These days, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, live a comfortable life in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, dividing their time between the bank and community activities. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON>'s biggest personal satisfaction, he says, is in helping families, businesses and community groups get off the ground financially. One of his successes, he said, was arranging for a new home to be built for the <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a century-old organization in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> that provides retirement housing for indigent women. `` I really have a wonderful life as a banker,'' he said. `` You feel good because you've helped people.'' Next year, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtte </PERSON> plans to retire and is looking forward to doing a lot more traveling, fishing, gardening and shell collecting. `` I have a lot of things I'd like to do.''

<HEAD>Jeep Cherokee Limited Is Luxurious Off-roader</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> legend has turned luxurious. Just look at the 1988 Jeep Cherokee Limited 4-Wheel-Drive. While it carries the Jeep name _ for years synonymous with ruggedness, versatility and a certain wilderness-military strength _ this compact model has many of the same features of expensive European cars. There are the leather, wingback, front bucket seats with six-way power adjustment _ standard equipment. There is the 18-ounce carpeting, tinted glass and three-spoke, leather-wrapped steering wheel _ all standard. And yes, there is the $ 22,000-plus price tag for the two-door model, $ 23,000-plus for four doors. Designed with image-conscious buyers in mind, this is no ordinary Jeep. But then, in a comforting sort of way, it is. Once in four-wheel-drive, the Jeep Cherokee Limited eagerly takes on snow, ice, mud, whatever, giving the driver that confidence and peace of mind that have given Jeep its American legend reputation and left other vehicles in the ditch. The Cherokee, which comes in many versions besides the Limited, has won several awards since its debut in the 1984 model year. At that time, it was the first vehicle to be a simultaneous winner by three four-wheel-drive specialty magazines, Four Wheeler, 4Wheel & amp; Off Road and Off-Road. For the 1988 model year, Cherokee was picked Four Wheeler of the Year in the sport utility segment by <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheeler </ORGANIZATION> magazine and 4x4 of the Year by <ORGANIZATION> 4Wheel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Off Road magazine. It marks the first time a vehicle has repeated as a 4x4 award-winner. With a lineup ranging from a $ 12,538 four-wheel-drive version to the upscale Limited, the Cherokee has been a hit with buyers, too. Sales of the four-wheel-drive Cherokees plus four-wheel-drive Wagoneers _ a larger, top-of-the-line Jeep _ reached a third consecutive record in the 1987 model year with 110,962 sold. That's up from 109,929 in the 1986 model year and 97,802 in the 1985 model year Jeeps are built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and are heading for record sales in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which last August bought Jeep-maker <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. American buyers of Cherokees have median age of 37-41 with household income of $ 50,000 - $ 55,000, said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, manager of Jeep public Sixty percent are college educated. The top three reasons buyers give is the four-door availability, the off-road capability and its alternative to a family car, she said. Jeep is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nameplate to offer a four-door sport utility vehicle. Increasingly, women are the owners and principle drivers of the vehicles, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said, noting a 1987 survey found females accounted for 40 percent of Cherokee buyers-major drivers. Women like the option of going from two-wheel to four-wheel-drive and not having to fear getting stranded, they like the interior and they appreciate the good visibility from the Cherokee's tall profile, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> explained. The test model was impressive in both two-wheel and four-wheel-drive. A shift lever on the trasnmission console allowed the driver to choose which was appropriate for road-off-road conditions. The standard, electronic fuel-injected, 4-liter six-cylinder engine was peppy, mated with the standard four-speed automatic transmission. The engine is rated at 177 horsepower at 4,500 rpm and is the most powerful engine of its size in the light-duty truck market, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said. There was a trade-off in handling, however. While the vehicle performed superbly off road, the same design that permits such driving also made for a sometimes bouncy, jostling ride on pavement, especially at highway speeds on roads where expansion cracks were uneven. Drivers should be aware that sport utility vehicles such as the Cherokee handle differently from cars. There have been complaints of rollover accidents, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> warns in the owner's manual that the vehicle's higher center of gravity and narrow track affect handling. Drivers should not make sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers that could lead to loss of control. But being seated up high also is advantageous. I could see over and around most other vehicles and was able to spot traffic bottlenecks well before I came upon them. On the down side, I had to hike up straight skirts to climb into the Cherokee and it was difficult to emerge gracefully. I wound up taking a flying leap from the driver seat. The rear liftgate was well-designed with washer-wiper that kept the rear view clear and a door that went up easily, leaving a flat opening so I did n't have to heave items up and over the back of the vehicle. The leather seats were comfortable and seating, front and back, was spacious. There were amenities such as front map reading lights, tilt steering and power antenna. But the front vent windows on the test model took a lot of effort to open. The key would not always come out of the ignition after I put the shifter in park and turned off the engine. Often, I had to slam the shifter forward again to free the key. And the cruise control, on the turn signal stalk, sometimes wound up in the `` on'' position when it was n't activated. Another point: Consumer Reports' survey of owners shows Cherokees in the 1984-6 model years ranked much worse than average than other cars and trucks in having problems and needing repair.

 Opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases is growing as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> begin talks over the future of the last bastion of American defense in the far <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` I think sooner or later the bases will have to go,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos-Shahani </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' Senate Foreign Relations Committee. `` The only question is when and how. We will have to cut the umbilical chord at some point.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views the naval and air bases as crucial to Western defense, including that of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and Indian oceans as well as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. At the same time, the installations provide the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with $ 180 million a year in rental income, guarantee <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic aid and pump millions more dollars into the local economy. The talks, expected to begin in early April, are part of a periodic review of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains facilities at <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base and four smaller installations. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians and dependents are stationed at the bases, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last major garrisons in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Philippine sources say President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government will demand a substantial increase in the $ 180 million annual rent, as well as an end to `` unhampered military operations'' allowed under the current agreement. Some Philippine legislators have suggested the rent be increased to more than $ 2 billion a year. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> negotiator in the talks, says $ 1.2 billion a year would be `` realistic.'' The talks will also determine whether the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will allow the bases, which are officially under Filipino command but effectively U.S.-run, to remain after the agreement expires in 1991. Any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agrees to a substantial increase in financial compensation, `` it would be a waste of time'' to consider extending the agreement after 1991. The review will also profoundly effect the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its former colony. It takes place amid a wave of nationalist sentiment unleashed by the 1986 uprising that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. That sentiment has sharpened the `` love-hate'' relationship of 58 million Filipinos with the country that crushed their aspirations for freedom nearly a century ago and which, in the minds of many people here, still orchestrates events in its former colony. `` The review will show how far the Aquino leadership can assert <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> sovereignty and protect the country's interest,'' said The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. Apart from compensation, the issue of nuclear weapons is also expected to complicate the talks. A provision in the new constitution states that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` consistent with the national interest, adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons in its territory.'' Three bills have been submitted in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ban not only nuclear weapons but nuclear-powered warships. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to confirm or deny that it stores such weapons here.

 In the eyes of Filipino opponents, the bases provide the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with considerable political and economic leverage over them. According to a widely held view, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to protect the bases and then turned against him only when it appeared the country was headed for a bloody upheavel that would have threatened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. `` If we get the Americans out, they wo n't have as much opportunity to interfere,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wigberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>, a leading bases opponent. He proposes closing the bases when the current agreement runs out in three years and conducting studies in the interim to find alternate uses for them. Supporters of the bases maintain that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, already languishing under a $ 29 billion foreign debt, can ill-afford to do without the money it receives from the bases. In addition to military and economic aid, the bases pay their 68,000 Filipino employees and concessionaires more than $ 96 million a year. That makes the installations the country's second largest paymaster after the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government itself. `` We believe that if they -LRB- Americans -RRB- would pull out, it would cause economic chaos in our city,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the home of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would become a ghost town. About 55 to 60 percent of our income comes from the base.'' Despite the economic advantages, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities acknowledge that public support for the bases has declined, although a majority still support the bases. A survey of about 2,000 <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> residents, taken in December by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Ateneo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, indicated that 36 percent of the respondents believed the bases should be reduced or closed altogether. That represented an increase of 11 percent in anti-bases sentiment over the previous six months, the survey said. This past October, Communist rebels killed three Americans in a series of unprecedented attacks outside <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The rebels have recently stepped up operations on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which borders the Subic compound. `` I think anti-American sentiment has been part of the U.S.-Philippine relationship from the very beginning,'' said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>. `` It's there, and I do n't regard the current situation as anything particularly threatening. It's a function of the relationship.'' Hostility toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> emerged in the Spanish-American War in 1898, when Adm. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> sailed into <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, defeated the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> navy and accepted the surrender of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s only Asian colony. The Americans forged an alliance with Filipino rebels led by <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguinaldo </PERSON>, who had declared independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> two months earlier. But in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, pressure mounted on President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> to annex the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as a colony and deny Filipino independence. On Feb. 6, 1899, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a single vote ratified the Treaty of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which formally ended the Spanish-American War and ceded the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That triggered the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurrection </ORGANIZATION>, a vicious, three-year conflict in which, by Philippine records, 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops slaughtered 1 million Filipinos in a bloody guerrilla conflict. Although a benign <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonial administration overcame much of the bitterness, a residual feeling of distrust and hostility toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained. Such feelings have also been coupled with a sense of identity and dependence on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, due largely to the fact that unlike the Spanish, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonial administration introduced mass education. That stamped <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values, as well as the English language, on a Southeast Asian people whose culture was already a hybrid of Malay, Chinese, Moslem and Spanish influences. Strong foreign influence has profoundly affected a people who, unlike the Chinese, Japanese and other Asians, had never enjoyed freedom as an integral nation state until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> granted independence July 4, 1946. This unique colonial legacy colors the Philippine bases debate in a manner far different from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discussions in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and other nations that host American forces. `` We have problems here of identity, of the continuation of the mentality of dependance which the Germans, the Italians and the Greeks do n't have in relation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they were never a colony,'' Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Democrats Looked for Front-Runner As Bush Obits Proved Premature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> amazed the pundits with a political resurrection, the Democrats lost a front-runner off the good ship Monkey Business, staged what looked like candidate-a-week auditions for a replacement and now worry about a convention without a clear winner. At its midpoint, the 1988 presidential campaign can claim more than its share of unexpected twists and turns. Without a front-runner, the lesser known Democrats found it hard to get attention and gain stature. The race became `` a series of isolated judgments,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, campaign manager for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> referred to the phenomenon of no Democratic being able to put together a series of victories. And as both parties looked ahead to November, they expressed pessimism. `` This looks to me like 1960 all over again,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a conservative Republican and adviser to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. That was a year the Democrats recaptured the White House at the close of Republican <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s second term. Once again, said <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, `` You have an aging president, who's kind of loved and recognized as doing a decent job. `` This is the Democrats' year,'' he lamented. `` The Republicans are going to have to work real hard to change that and the Democrats are going to have to help them a little in this nomination process, which I think they're going to do.'' Some Democrats agree that they could easily give the Republican the help they need. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> predicted there'll be some brokering before the party's nominee can be selected, and he warned that if it takes place at the Democratic National Convention next summer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> `` the whole <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will see you in the grubby business of cutting deals.'' Two Democrats _ <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> _ were knocked out of contention long before any votes were cast. Television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> startled Republicans with his organizational skill, and even more with his accounts of conversations with God. Southern Democrats tried to give their nominating process a conservative cast and created Super Tuesday which gave the biggest boost to a pair of liberals _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s reputation took a beating and so did momentum. Voters demonstrated repeatedly they do n't always do what the pollsters predict they will. And once again, money proved the indispensable element of campaigns for everybody but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who? Among Republicans, the debate centered on who could legitimately claim his conservative legacy and retain some of his electoral magic. For the most conservative element in the party, it also was the year to determine whether they or <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> moderates, represented by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would control the party in the post-Reagan era. The Democrats looked forward to a presidential campaign without <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the ballot, but also were aware they had lost four of the last five national elections, being virtually shut out in the South and West. They, too, talked of a fight for control of the party's future. Both parties started out with bumper crops of candidates and near candidates. Remember <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>? A former <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman, White House chief of staff and <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, he had a resume that rivaled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and a speaking style that was a sure cure for insomnia. He appeared at Republican events around the country trying to drum up support for a presidential bid before finally giving up on April 2, 1987. Former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, best known as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s close friend, also dipped a toe into the presidential waters but pulled it out when he discovered how tough it could be to raise millions of dollars. Conseratives were titillated by the prospect that <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director, or <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador would run. Both eventually said no. The Democrats had their share of reluctant dragons. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> considered running and then did n't; Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said, no, no, a thousand times no. Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and his governor, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, decided against running. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wanted to run but found raising enough money too great a hurdle. And then, of course, there was the ubiquitous Governor <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I will not be a candidate,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declared in 1987, setting off still more speculation on whether or not he was running. `` Why do n't you want to be president?'' he was asked a year later. `` Who said I do n't want to be president?'' he retorted. `` Do you want to be president?'' pressed the questioner. `` No,'' he replied. But there plenty of real candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and former secretary of state <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on the Republican side. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for the Democrats. The race began early with Democrats <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> taking the traditional route throught the small towns of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, campaigning for legislative candidates in the 1986 elections. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> did much the same thing on the Republican side. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Republicans tried to grab some of the presidential campaign spotlight. In the summer of 1986, they elected thousands of precinct level party officials who eventually would decide the allocation of the state's 77-member delegation to the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August 1988. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign liked the idea. The vice president beat <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 1980 primary. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was already at work and his forces matched the vice president's at the crucial task of recruiting candidates for the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> election. That was the first indication of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s potential It was bad news for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and even worse for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Then came Iran-Contra and the disclosures that the administration had been involved in covert arms sales to the Ayatollah. It was a bleak moment for the administration and it looked like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be the principal political victim. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s advisers were split on the likely impact, but the senator was among those who thought it would severely wound <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I thought it was serious,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager. `` But I never thought it would deprive the vice president of the nomination.'' <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s economy would prove an even greater hurdle for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, things had gone from bad to worse in the state and it was one of the few soft spots in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s generally strong approval from Americans <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigned there as a fellow Midwesterner with a rural background and an understanding of the problems of farmers. `` I'm from <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and proud of it,'' he told countless audiences. The campaign began to get nasty. `` He's sort of had a charmed life in politics, he's gotten quite a ways without ever doing much,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said of the vice president. As <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> continued to portray <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a vice president who had no more than a passive role in administration affairs, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign accused the senator of being `` mean-spirited'' and practicing `` cronyism.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> later accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of deliberately trying to provoke him. `` I think that was the effort,'' he said. `` I was a bit testy a time or two. I was getting angry.''

 At the start of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was the overwhelming favorite in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, attracting more support in polls than all his opponents combined. But a week after he announced his candidacy, the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> published a story saying a team of its reporters had observed <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> spending part of a weekend at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> townhouse with <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. Then it was learned that <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and the women had traveled to <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION> together on the yacht, Monkey Business. The publicity was devastating and a week after he entered the race, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> withdrew with a bitter denunciation of the news media. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s abrupt departure scrambled the Democratic field. But one of those given the best chance of capitalizing on the new dynamic was <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, the youthful chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and one of the party's best stump speakers. But four months later, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> was forced out after disclosure that he had lifted campaign speech material from British politician <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, delivering a personal anecdote as if it were his own. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> caught some fallout from the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> incident when it was learned that two of his top advisers were involved in leaking material that pointed out the link between the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> speeches. As <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> began looking like the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> front-runner, his rivals zeroed in on the congressman's populist message. `` Where I come from, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is the establishment,'' said <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. `` I'm leery of election-year conversions,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ran television ads that attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` one of the biggest tax raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> ran ads attacking <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for changing his positions on issues. But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> appeared to have the strongest message _ a tough attack on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading partners, those nations running huge trade surpluses that could be traced to unfair practices. `` Because of trade barriers, a $ 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> K-Car costs $ 48,000 in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' said a <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ad, ignoring the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars were not sold in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said that if the Korean did n't change their ways they'd be left `` asking themselves how many Americans are going to pay $ 48,000 for one of their Hyundais. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> weighed in and the winners were <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished a poor third behind <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Next stop was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. It was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard and he won easily, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> edging <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for second place. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> on a roll. He steadily eroded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s big lead in the state and it looked like the Kansan would make it two in a row and probably knock <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> out of the race. No one was sure what happened next. On the last weekend before the primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran ads accusing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of straddling on such issues as taxes and arms control. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign never responded. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the primary by nine points. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, interviewed on television, was asked if he had anything to say to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Tell him to stop lying about my record,'' snapped the senator. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> finished last in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but looked ahead with relish to the next big round, Super Tuesday in the South, the region where he had his greatest following. Two other candidates made an impression in the early contests. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> showed a far greater ability to attract white votes than he had during his first run for the presidency four years earlier. And <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was conspicuous by his absence. He gambled everything on his native South, planning to become the first beneficiary of Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> bounced back to win <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. But the South lay ahead and the Kansan had nothing going for him in the region. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Republicans held a primary the Saturday before Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> thought the state was tailor-made for his Bible Belt appeal. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> got the endorsement of Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, and decided it would be a good state to challenge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Both proved very wrong. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native, had organized well for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the vice president swept the state, in a preview of Super Tuesday when he won 16 of 16 primaries. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was second in most, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> third. Super Tuesday effectively ended the Republican race. A week later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swamped <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and the only question was when the senator would bow out. On the Democratic side, it settled nothing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> split the spoils, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the big loser. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> did n't compete, but then won strongly in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> which permitted him to go on for at least one more state _ <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on April 5.

 The government has delivered two welcome pieces of economic news: consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent in February and the economy in late 1987 expanded at the liveliest pace in nearly two years.

 Financial markets showed scant reaction to government reports of low inflation in February and strong economic growth at the end of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.49 points Wednesday to 2,067.64 as gainers outnumbered losers about 3-to-2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar finished lower and interest rates on the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose to 8.73 percent from 8.70 percent. Falling energy and food prices in February helped restrain the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 0.2 percent after a 0.3 percent increase in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. For the first two months of the year, prices increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent _ lower than the moderate 4.4 percent inflation for all 1987. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a brisk 4.8 percent annual pace in the final three months of last year. It was the second upward revision in the fourth-quarter GNP, estimated a month ago at 4.5 percent and in January at 4.2 percent. The department said better-than-expected performance in exports, consumer spending and business investment led to the latest revision, which pushed growth for the year to a rate of 4 percent from 2.2 percent in 1986. It was the biggest annual increase since a 5.1 percent rise in 1984. The 4.8 percent fourth-quarter growth followed 4.3 percent growth in the July-September quarter and was the fastest quarterly growth rate since an increase of 5.4 percent in the first three months of 1986. Recent economic reports have shown an economy that rebounded quickly from last October's stock market collapse. Analysts see little likelihood of an election-year recession. `` One of the best kept secrets in economic circles these days is that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is going to end with a bang, not a whimper, as the economy makes a successful transition to an export-led economy,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech to the American Business Conference. `` There is at this point no indication of any major widespread acceleration of inflation,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-area economic forecasting service. Still, there remained pockets of inflation, particularly in service industries. Medical care services were up 0.7 percent in February. In two other economic reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax corporate profits shot up 8.4 percent in 1987 to $ 137.4 billion after declining the year before Analysts credited the turnaround in profits to the weaker dollar, which has boosted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales overseas, and to subdued labor wage demands. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings, after discounting for inflation, edged up 0.2 percent in February It was the second monthly advance, matching an identical 0.2 percent January increase, but it still left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 0.7 percent below where they were a year ago

<HEAD>Moore McCormack Announces Recapitalization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hostile takeover target <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has unveiled a $ 400 million recapitalization plan and says it is holding talks with unidentified parties over a possible alternative buyout. The company, target of a hostile $ 35 a share, or $ 441 million, buyout offer from Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday its proposed recapitalization would pay shareholders a special dividend valued at more than $ 33 per share in cash and securities. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> acknowledged that it would abandon the dividend payout if it received a buyout offer that `` produces higher values'' for shareholders, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tregurtha </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. In trading Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> rose $ 1.62 -LCB- to close at $ 38.75 a share. Under terms of a plan approved by the company's board of directors, shareholders would receive a cash dividend of $ 26.60 per common share and a newly created, 15-year subordinated debenture with a face value of $ 6.62. In addition, the board instructed management `` to begin immediately implementing a program that will maximize cash flow, ... reduce costs, and raise cash through the sale'' of the company's oil and gas operations and certain other assets, <PERSON> Tregurtha </PERSON> stated. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> last month rejected the initial bid of $ 31-a-share, or $ 391 million, from <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION>, a cement and energy company. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its offer to $ 35 per share, but <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s board last week called the offer inadequate and recommended the company's shareholders reject it. <PERSON> Tregurtha </PERSON> said in a statement that `` the board believes that the recapitalization is superior to the revised <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> tender offer.'' He said the special dividend provided shareholders with immediate value and allowed them to retain a long-term equity investment in <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>. The company said it will proceed with the dividend payout even if <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> terminates its offer, unless it is acquired. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to provide up to $ 420 million in loans to fund the dividends and related costs. With the recapitalization plan, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> has projected its income before interest and taxes will range from $ 46.2 million in 1988 to $ 66.4 million in 1992. The company posted a profit of $ 21.6 million on revenue of $ 357.8 million in 1987. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> makes cement, concrete products and aggregates, primarily in the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production.

<HEAD>GTE Says Top-Speed Laser Moves Video Jukeboxes, Video Phones

<TEXT>
 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> say a new laser that can switch on and off a record 22 billion times per second marks a big step in the development of better televisions, computers and video telephones. The tiny semiconductor laser developed at <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, theoretically would be capable of sending 200 to 400 video signals over an optical fiber simultaneously, the company said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> officials said the breakthrough increased the potential for use of fiber optics _ now used mainly for carrying voice or data _ for carrying video signals as well. `` Your telephone is going to be a television, a computer telephone and a voice -LRB- transmitter -RRB- rolled into one,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Riseberg </PERSON>, director of electronics and photronics, the <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> labs division that developed the device. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> said it increased the laser's speed by decreasing the width of the light-emitting region. It said the record topped its own world record of 18 billion cycles per second set in 1986. The fibers, which are made of a flexible glass that transmits light signals, gradually are replacing metal wires in telecommunications. Stronger and longer-lasting than metals, optical fibers also have the virtue of being able to carry far more signals. But lasers needed to be created so the fibers could achieve their potential. The higher the laser speed, the more signals can be sent over the optical fibers. For example, instead of getting 20 stations on cable television, a TV set could receive perhaps 400 channels at a time. <PERSON> Riseberg </PERSON> said that in five to 10 years the faster laser dramatically could expand the nightly viewing menu. `` Instead of there being a scheduled program on cable, we're looking at technical improvements where you can pick out a video and have it shown on your fiber,'' <PERSON> Riseberg </PERSON> said `` Like a video jukebox.'' Optical fibers already connect the central offices of telephone exchanges. In the future, the hair-thin strands may be be installed house-to-house and business-to-business, facilitating video telephones and computers that converse with each other more rapidly than they can over current conventional telephone lines with a modem.

 After four years of tortuous litigation, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has gotten permission to lower the curtain on its multibillion-dollar legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the historic bankruptcy case stemming from it. But while that particular act may be ending, the broader drama continues. The nation's third-largest oil company widely is seen as vulnerable to a takeover attempt by investors who believe they can realize big profits by winning control of the company and then selling its assets. Such raiders may have allies among the legions of shareholders that analysts say were disenchanted with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management even before it became entangled in the legal morass that prompted its bankruptcy filing last April 12. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management has vowed to resist any attempt to dismember the company but many industry experts expect at least one full-scale takeover attempt, which could leave a much different <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> standing once the battle is over. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON> on Wednesday confirmed <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection, the keystone of which was an out-of-court settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. Having agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 billion in cash to drop its $ 10.3 billion judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest oil company is gearing up for a reorganization involving sales of $ 3 billion worth of assets. The <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based oil giant's troubles began in November 1985, when a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury made the unprecedented $ 10.3 billion damage award to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> after deciding <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> improperly had interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> so that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> itself could buy <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to avoid posting what it said would be a ruinous $ 11 billion bond while appealing that verdict. It was the largest bankruptcy filing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. By last December, after a string of losses in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state courts, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> chose to settle rather than risking everything on the chance that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would overrule the judgment. The reorganization package approved by <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON> was negotiated laboriously by committees representing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors, its shareholders, and <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> The plan takes effect _ and <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> will be paid _ on April 7. But a lot of bitterness remains, as well as some sticky issues raised during the bankruptcy negotiations. All factions of interested parties favored endorsement of the reorganization plan, including 96 percent of the shares that were voted on the measure. However, there still are objections to the plan's provisions to grant immunity to all parties involved in the original Texaco-Getty-Pennzoil matter. On Tuesday, a small group of dissident shareholders settled 16 suits against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, saying they would support the reorganization plan in the belief that company would be in far worse condition if it were not approved. The dissidents _ along with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> _ had contended the liability releases eliminated a chance for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to recoup some of its losses by suing the parties responsible for the court judgment. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns 14.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, also protested that the releases entrenched management and diminished its accountability to shareholders. While voting for plan, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> urged the court to strike the releases. <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON> refused, agreeing with arguments by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> that the releases were, on balance, `` in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> consistently has been harshly critical of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management, pointing out the company's record in replacing its reserves was among the worst of the major oil companies Several analysts, who would not speak on the record because their companies do business with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, recently expressed sympathy with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management. Noting that it was <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s desperation for new oil that led it into the Getty deal in 1984, one industry watcher said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to resume `` business as usual'' despite statements by President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> and other top managers that the company would boost earnings and cash flow. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is not the only well-known takeover specialist to involve himself with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> last month told the company that his <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, an oil and gas concern, was seeking regulatory clearance to buy more than $ 15 million of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. Absent objections by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> would be free to acquire up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an independent marketer of petroleum products born of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acquisition, has made a similar filing. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also has announced he will field a slate of five candidates, including himself, when five of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 14 board seats _ including <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>'s _ come up for election at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s next annual meeting. The meeting tentatively is set for May, if the company does not put itself up for sale. Several analysts said <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> may have a hard time keeping his seat, given widespread shareholder resentment over <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s business troubles in recent years There also may be a lingering groundswell of resentment among the thousands of shareholders who rely on investment dividend income and have been deprived of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> dividends since the company filed for Chapter 11, the analysts said.

<HEAD>Honolulu Mayor Leads Assault Against Japanese Investment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A recent wave of Japanese purchases of everything from farmland to memberships at prestigious country clubs has sparked a backlash from residents peeved at a resulting rise in property taxes and longer lines at the golf course. The Japanese have been investing in the Hawaiian islands since statehood, but have drawn criticism because of recent high-profile acquisitions made at premium prices. Many economists and local officials oppose the latest round of `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> bashing,'' calling the foreign-based investment a boon to the state and a sign of Japanese confidence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. But others, including <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON>, want to limit Japanese investment here. `` They just about own downtown,'' <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> has proposed state legislation to prohibit the sale of residential, agricultural or preservation property to anyone who is not a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, has no plans to become a citizen or would not live on the land at least half the year. The proposal, based on similar statutes in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, would not affect the sale of commercial, resort and industrial land. It has little chance of being considered by the state legislature because it was submitted late in the session. <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> blames the Japanese for skyrocketing property taxes resulting from rising home prices as well as longer waits for tee-off times at the <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where Japanese nationals pay $ 150,000 for memberships. But he denies his proposal is racist. `` All I'm trying to do is stop the speculators from doing here what they've already done in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' which is price out the average buyer, <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> said. Earlier this week it was announced that a Japanese real estate firm paid a record $ 280 a square foot _ about $ 14 million total _ for a parcel of land in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kapiolani </LOCATION> business district. Japanese investors have paid a total of $ 99 million for property along <LOCATION> Kapiolani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> since 1986. Another Japanese investor sparked protests last month over his plans to evict an elderly couple from the agricultural land they had leased for 10 years so he could build a golf course. A Japanese real estate firm recently paid $ 21 million for `` <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION>,'' the highest price ever paid for a private home in the exclusive southern <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> beachfront area of <LOCATION> Waialae-Kahala </LOCATION>. The average value of homes in the neighborhood has risen between 30 percent and 100 percent under the latest city property assessments, mostly because foreign investors have been snapping up houses at high prices. Area residents say they have received unsolicited offers in their mailboxes and been offered millions of dollars in cash for their homes. <PERSON> Wali </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, associate economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>, said the strength of the Japanese yen and the ability to borrow against high-priced <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> properties allows the Japanese to pay more than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyers. `` What the Japanese are doing is perfectly logical,'' <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said. `` They would be foolish not to take advantage of the strength of their yen.'' The Japanese have invested heavily in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since the 1960s. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said the latest surge _ about $ 3 billion invested since 1986 _ attracted attention only because so many properties were purchased in a short time. `` Maybe they put in a little too much money a little too fast,'' <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said. `` But $ 3 billion is a small portion of the total assets in the state.'' <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON>'s proposal ignores the rights of the seller and discriminates against the Japanese. `` People have been selling their houses to the Japanese for twice as much as they could get elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said. `` They've been getting rich What about their right to sell to whoever offers the highest price?'' <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayetano </PERSON> dismisses <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON>'s plan as political rhetoric. `` The man's running for re-election,'' <PERSON> Cayetano </PERSON> said. `` But he's a hypocrite On the one hand he's telling the Japanese to pour in their money for business development and then he's saying they ca n't invest in houses here.'' <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> has proposed that Japanese firms be allowed to build a convention center here and that they help finance a light rail rapid transit system. <PERSON> Cayetano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> was fueling an anti-Japanese attitude that could cause a backlash against Japanese-Americans _ who make up about 25 percent of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s population _ and Japanese visitors, who have invigorated the state's tourist industry. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vistors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, about 20 percent of the 5.7 million people who vacationed in the islands last year were from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They accounted for 33 percent of vistor expenditures, more than triple the share of their counterparts from the mainland and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> -RRB- is doing what is politically popular at the moment,'' <PERSON> Cayetano </PERSON> said. `` But here, where the Japanese are so important, it's especially insulting.'' <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON>'s proposal was rejected, the current wave of anti-Japanese sentiment should blow over, as it had in the past. `` This is n't the first time politicians have used this tactic,'' <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said. `` But we are n't about to become a colony of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and people who think so are just overreacting.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> warned of future job losses and free-trade problems after a Canadian tribunal dismissed their claims of damages from the sale of inexpensive <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cars from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that it found no evidence of material injury to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries because of the cut-price compact cars that <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> has sold in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since 1984. The three-member government panel ordered a halt to anti-dumping proceedings against <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and a refund of some $ 8 million in bonds the company had posted. Wednesday's ruling has implications for all <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> car makers: the Canadian auto industry is linked with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations under a 1965 trade agreement treating the continent as a single market. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> was forced to post the bonds when Revenue <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the government tax collector, upheld the dumping complaint last November and imposed preliminary import duties averaging 26 percent. Dumping is the practice of exporting goods at a price below what they cost in the domestic market. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> of introducing its Pony, Stellar and Excel models in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> at below-cost prices to get a foothold in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They complained they lost profits when they had to slash prices and offer rebates to remain competitive. At hearings that ended March 10, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged its aim was to gain a path to the lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. But the company denied harming <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or the Canadian auto industry. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car giants did not make subcompacts in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and contended <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was making handsome profits here. Furthermore, both companies have business links to other South Korean carmakers, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> noted. The Canadian government's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> intervened on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> to say the company had fostered competition in the small-car market and kept prices down. Within a year of introducing its $ 4,500 Pony hatchback, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> cornered 7 percent of the Canadian car market. It then expanded to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where it sold 264,000 Excels last year. But recent Canadian sales were depressed because of the dumping case. If upheld, the duties would have added $ 800 to the price of a new <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> called the decision a `` triumph'' for consumers, while <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> welcoming the decision. Whatever the outcome of the case, the South Korean conglomerate had pledged to proceed with plans for a $ 259 million manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Bromont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, and a parts factory in <LOCATION> Newmarket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> have 10 days to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. They said they would decide after receiving the tribunal's detailed explanations next month Both companies warned that unfair foreign competition could lead to job losses in the Canadian industry, which employs 140,000 workers directly and another 400,000 indirectly, mostly in southern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. `` It has been and remains our contention that continued unrestrained dumping by <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> will result in lost jobs and investment in the Canadian auto industry,'' stated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peapples </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON> complained of flaws in Canadian trade law and said the case set a bad precedent for the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement due for ratification by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later this year. <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> said the law forced the tribunal to look at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> production and sales only in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where small-car output has been phased out, instead of examining <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated operations throughout the continent. `` We're alarmed by the implications today's decision has for other industries which may become rationalized under the free-trade agreement,'' <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> said. He said the shortcoming must be fixed in the first years of the free-trade treaty or more industries will come in for `` predatory dumping.''

 Declining mid-March sales of U.S.-made cars are not a sign of trouble but a return to balance in the market, industry analysts say. Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 298,754 during the March 11-20 sales period, down from 333,623 for mid-March 1987 but up 0.7 percent on a daily basis, the automakers reported Wednesday. `` I do n't see this weakness in mid-March as a prediction of greater weakness throughout the year,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>. The eight companies making autos in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sold 189,245 cars in the period's eight sales days, down from 217,939 in nine sales days in the comparable 1987 period. The daily sales rate slid 2.3 percent. Sales of domestic-made light trucks totaled 109,509, a decrease from 115,684 in the year-ago period but still a 6.5 percent increase in daily sales. Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. Domestic sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 million for the mid-March period. That would indicate a decline from 1987's 7.1 million in domestic sales, although in the 30 days before the March period sales ran at an 8.1 million annual pace. `` It looks like sales are beginning to drop back down to a more expected level,'' said <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>, of J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said sales surged earlier as some people responded to buying incentives offered by the automakers and as some went ahead with purchases put off after the October stock market crash `` Now it is going to start to settle down,'' she said. Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks for the year to date totaled 2.4 million, up 16.4 percent on a daily basis from 2.1 million sold through the mid-March period in 1987. Industry leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold 92,173 domestic-made cars in the March 11-20 period, down from 105,438 in the 1987 period. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s daily sales rate fell by 1.7 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> auto sales of 54,186 fell from 67,672 in the year-earlier period, and were down 9.9 percent on a daily basis. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> car sales jumped to 30,801 in this year's eight-day selling period from 31,699 in the nine-day period in 1987, up 9.3 percent daily. Chrysler light truck sales jumped even more, to 24,691 from 20,987 in the year-earlier period, a 32.4 percent leap in daily sales. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> truck sales totaled 45,376 in the eight-day period compared with 43,515 a year earlier, with the daily sales rate rising by 17.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> light truck sales sagged to 36,812, from 49,164 in the year-earlier period. The daily sales rate fell 15.8 percent. Market shares of the Big Three automakers changed slightly from a year earlier, with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> capturing 48.7 percent, compared with 48.4 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dropping to 28.6 percent from 31.1 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> rising to 16.3 percent from 14.5 percent. Aggressive incentives paid off for some Japanese companies making cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of 7,270 represented a 9.8 percent increase in daily sales rate. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> sold 1,034 U.S.-made cars, down from 1,330 a year earlier, and down 12.5 percent on a daily basis.

The new proposal has an indicated value of about $ 1.68 billion, compared with $ 1.57 billion for the alternative hostile bid. It was made in a letter sent late Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> from British investor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> has teamed with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker, in its attempt to acquire the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> building materials, paving services and chemical company. The hostile tender offer remains in effect, said <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said the company had no immediate comment on the latest proposal. <PERSON> Kopper </PERSON>'s board of directors has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 56 a share offer as inadequate, and reiterated it was exploring a possible defensive recapitalization that would include a one-time payment to shareholders. `` We believe we are able to offer greater value to your stockholders than any plan you are presently considering,'' <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> stated in his letter to <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON>. `` If you have a recapitalization plan that provides your stockholders and employees with more benefits than we are prepared to provide, we, and your other stockholders, are anxious to see it.'' Separately, about 250 of the company's employees cut up an estimated 175 charge cards from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, during a downtown protest. `` We're damn mad,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Beidler </PERSON>. `` We want <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> to know that this gathering is just the tip of the iceberg.'' Management also has canceled its <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> account, through which the company had been buying about $ 1.5 million per year in goods and services, said <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Shearson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> of offering to defend the company from hostile takeovers at the same time that it was plotting its attack with <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's quite a deal, and we're saying no,'' <PERSON> Beidler </PERSON> said. `` We're going to send our cards back to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in pieces.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also have come under fire from state officials for their role in the hostile bid.

<HEAD>Delay In New Software Depresses Lotus Stock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock could remain depressed for some time following the company's announcement of a six-month delay in the release of a new version of its high-selling 1-2-3 software, industry watchers say. Wall Street analysts this week scaled back their earnings estimates for the company after it delayed the new Release 3 software. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> executives sold off large blocks of stock and a top executive resigned. `` I think the stock is going to underperform until we get closer to the release date on shipment of the 1-2-3 Release 3,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Readerman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 3.50 a share to $ 25.25 a share in over-the-counter trading Wednesday, a 12 percent drop in market value. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> sold 250,000 shares of company stock, and several vice presidents sold between 12,800 shares and 95,800 shares. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Digate </PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of software development, left the company last week. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> said some of the stock sales occurred because executives exercised stock options last August and had to wait six months before selling to meet tax payments. But <PERSON> Readerman </PERSON> said: `` The timing of the sales just raises a credibility issue. That is as much a reason why the stock is down. If it was just the product slip date, I do n't think you'd see the stock where it is.'' Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> is trailing its competitors in developing new spreadsheet programs and said they expected some of the 3.5 million Lotus 1-2-3 users to defect to other brands. `` For some reason <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> just has n't kept pace with the industry in bringing out new products,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlund </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They've been long on promise in announcing new products but short on delivery.'' Analysts cut <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' 1988 earnings per share estimates to between $ 1.55 and $ 1.65 from about $ 1.95. They also trimmed revenue forecasts for the year to about $ 400 million from $ 465 million. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> last year reported net income of $ 72 million, or $ 1.58 per share, on revenue of $ 395.6 million. The upgraded 1-2-3 software originally was expected in June. The company said the new program, which promises to print better graphs, work faster and combine many spreadsheets, will be available in the fourth quarter. Analysts said the delay would give <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a chance to gain market share with new software products designed to compete with 1-2-3. Last November, <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> released its Quattro spreadsheet, which has been praised as better than 1-2-3, and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, the leading personal computer software maker, released its Windows Excel software. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' investor relations director, said the company needs more time to make the new 1-2-3 programs small enough to work with personal computers. `` We obviously are concerned about the delay,'' <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said. `` Any time a product slips it's not good. -LRB- But -RRB- we think it's going to be worth waiting for.'' The new 1-2-3 will cost $ 495, same as the old one. People who have an authorized copy of the current 1-2-3 can upgrade for $ 150. Analysts project $ 100 million to $ 150 million in sales in the first 12 to 18 months of its release. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday named <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a former vice president of development for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s personal computer division, to replace <PERSON> Digate </PERSON>.

 The wine in the $ 3,200 bottle was an acclaimed 1984 merlot, but there was something even rarer about the <ORGANIZATION> Cuvaison </ORGANIZATION> magnum that <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> bought at a recent <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> charity auction. The grape art label on the <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> wine was believed to be the first work designed for wine by the pop art pioneer <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, who died last year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at age 58. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> donated the art to the <LOCATION> Cuvaison </LOCATION> winery in the late 1970s. It is a striking, bias-cut piece based on a stylized vision of what <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> thought nature should have made grapes look like: the six grapes are in hues of red and deep green. The overall label, which was placed on just 84 bottles, has <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s name cut in above the art. It was designed and completed last year by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> graphic artist <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> under commission by <ORGANIZATION> Cuvaison </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Esser </PERSON>. Said <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON>, `` The label was at first considered to be very strange,'' but, like the wine, the work improved with age and came into increasing favor. <PERSON> Esser </PERSON> finally ordered the art made into a finished label, and <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> readied it for reproduction in a week. `` <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> did many commercial things, but basically <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> was a fine artist,'' said <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON>. `` He was a painter who experimented with silk-screening and avant-garde techniques. I tried to do the same thing, only convert it into something marketable.'' Still under wraps are <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s creations for two other labels, one for white wine, the other for rose. No plans for them have been announced. As a memorial to <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s talent, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s industrialist <PERSON> Schmidheiny </PERSON> family, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Cuvaison </ORGANIZATION>, ordered the current labeling limited to 84 bottles. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidheiny </PERSON> were friends of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s, and thought to use his work to evoke a fine-arts theme for special wines. `` We intended this label to be one of a series of artist's labels for <ORGANIZATION> Cuvaison </ORGANIZATION>'s special bottlings,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schmidheiny </PERSON> said `` When the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Cuvaison </ORGANIZATION> merlot was released, we decided to use his label only on 84 magnum bottles on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the winery.'' `` As it turned out, the wine itself was very well received ... hopefully a small memorial to Mr. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s great talent.''

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies at Lower Levels, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar steadied at lower levels early in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today after a sell-off during Asian trading. Gold prices rose. Traders said the dollar was driven downward in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> by trading benefitting the yen and British pound. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators due later today, including personal income for February, were not likely to move the market since an upward revision of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product for the fourth quarter was disregarded Wednesday, dealers said. The growth rate was revised to an annual rate of 4.8 percent, up from the previously reported 4.5 percent. `` There is still room for the yen and the pound to strengthen,'' said a trader in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. That means the dollar could fall a little lower during the course of the day, he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar closed at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 126.00 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6858 West German marks, down from 1.6915; 1.3940 Swiss francs, down from 1.3990; 5.7305 French francs, down from 5.7450; 1.8943 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9005; 1,248.95 Italian lire, down from 1,253.25; 1.2440 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2434. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.8425, compared with $ 1.8358 Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 452.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 453.00. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 453.90. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 453.25, up from $ 450.40 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.34 to close at $ 455.40 an ounce. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.67 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's $ 6.63.

<HEAD>Dollar And Stocks Close Lower In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar slid further against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stock prices also lost moderately. After opening at 126.75, the dollar edged down and closed at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen from its close of 127.15 yen on Wednesday. It ranged between 126.15 and 126.81 yen. Today's fall followed a 1.28-yen plunge on Tuesday, although the dollar edged up 0.08 yen on Wednesday. `` The prevalent view is that the dollar will go down further,'' said <PERSON> Taeko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The decline in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today followed the dollar's drop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the previous day, attributed to a prediction by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a former economic adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, that the dollar could fall to 120 yen or lower over the next six months. There was no news to affect the dollar during <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s trading today, however, Ms. <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, a 52.48-point gainer Wednesday, today lost 113.95 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 25,781.28. `` Profit-taking buy orders for large-capital issues, such as steels and heavy electricals, brought the stock average down,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The market, which had been driven by these major issues since the beginning of March, seemed to have taken a rest, with the trade volume declining to an estimated 800 million shares, he said. <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said investors retreated to the sidelines to watch the market's movements. Major losers today were steels and shipbuilding issues. Some electrical, real estate and shipping issues also lost ground.

 Convicted stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who made millions trading on inside information, would earn a maximum of 44 cents an hour at tasks ranging from landscaping to milking cows as an inmate in the prison recommended by his sentencing judge. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, 51, arrived Wednesday afternoon at the <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, prison camp, to begin serving his three-year term, the prison said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, who sentenced <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> on Dec. 18, had given him until today to surrender. The <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> facility, a 700-inmate minimum security facility about 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, is located on about 44,000 acres of heavily forested countryside and contains a dairy, slaughterhouse and furniture factory. Inmates sleep in a former army barracks. <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> warden <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said in a telephone interview last week that if <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> would have no special privileges or cushy prison jobs. `` Our people are assigned based on where our needs are,'' said <PERSON> Rison </PERSON>. `` He could be in the slaughterhouse, he could be in the landscape crew, he could be working in the dairy operation. He will be required to work a fulltime assignment.'' <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said the pay scale ranged from 11 cents to 44 cents an hour for a 40-hour week. As in other federal prison facilities, the money is credited to an account at the prison commissary, where inmates can buy toiletries, cigarettes and candy. During off hours, <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said, inmates can play tennis on a single concrete court, lift weights, roll boccie ball, shoot billiards or watch cable television at a half-dozen sets placed around the facility. Inmates have access to eight telephones but <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said there's a 15-minute limit on calls. <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> has been home to some other famous convicts, including former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration aide H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and fireworks magnate <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>, who was convicted in a major government-bribery and influence-peddling scandal. Convicted spy <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> was incarcerated in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>'s maximum-security section but escaped and led authorities on a chase for several months before he was seized in the Northwest. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, formerly one of Wall Street's best known speculators, stunned the financial world in November 1986 when he paid the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million fine to settle civil charges of insider trading, the misuse of confidential information to profit in securities deals. Since then he has cooperated extensively with federal investigators. In exchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s revelations reportedly have led to death threats against him, and there was speculation he had sought federal custody early because he feared for his life. Last month, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> friend and fellow speculator, was arrested on charges he threatened to kill <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s former head trader, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidoff </PERSON>, who also has pleaded guilty to securities fraud and is cooperating with investigators.

 Stock prices were sharply lower at midday Thursday as the market's budget-related rally finally ran out of steam. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was off 27.8 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,804.4. Volume was 297.3 million shares at midday, up from 211.2 million shares at the same time a day earlier. Dealers said the market was marked down heavily soon after trading started. The 100-stock index had moved well above the 1,800-point level prior to Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s March 15 budget statement. Investors predicted the budget would include major tax cutting measures and bullish forecasts on the British economy. The announcement of the budget met those expectations, but since then, the market has been unable to push much higher. `` Having seen not much follow-through since the budget in terms of buying, the question was whether there would be selling,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaitow </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today has shown that there is selling.'' Dealers said the market's nervousness was exacerbated by rumors of a major selling program by <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. But dealers at the brokerage firm denied there had been such a program Thursday.

 The stock market declined broadly today as the dollar slumped in foreign exchange and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates headed higher. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 31.17 to 2,036.47 in the first half hour of trading.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 32.18 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. With the dollar losing ground, prices of long-term government bonds dropped about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value this morning, putting their yields in the 8.75 to 8.8 percent range. At their best recent levels, yields on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds were as low as 8.3 percent. Analysts said pressure on the dollar prompted concern in markets around the world.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Positions Toughen on Beef, Citrus Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> seeks an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the end of March on opening the Japanese market wider to American beef and citrus fruit, but there still are conflicting opinions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the issue, a government official said Thursday. The current agreement on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s quotas on those items expires March 31. Separately, a senior aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday for talks aimed at a political solution to a dispute over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s construction market. On the agricultural issue, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said this week the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants all quotas dropped by April 1, or it will take the issue to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international forum for settling trade disputes. <PERSON> Yoshifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday, `` Our interest is to have a coordinated result, an agreement between the two governments by the end of the month.'' Asked how far <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was willing to go to compromise short of total liberalization, he said there were conflicting opinions and the government was not ready to make a statement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate unless <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sets a clear timetable for liberalization, something <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been unwilling to do. Members of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal-Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have expressed strong opposition to liberalization. `` <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is a good place to fight this out,'' said <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hata </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, after arguing in a meeting Wednesday that producing beef and oranges is essential to domestic farmers, and these must be protected. `` A country should be able to produce basic food items on its own,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuru </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a very big country and so can produce a lot. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is very small and thus needs to protect itself.'' While farmers and many consumers fear liberalization will destroy the domestic beef and citrus industry, leading to unemployment and a dangerous dependence on foreign sources of food, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> commented: `` If it did mean some structural adjustment, that's the price we pay for a free and open trading system. We've had some adjustment, too. Last month, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official predicted that imports of beef would be liberalized within two years, with a lifting of restrictions on citrus fruit even sooner. Tentative moves to appease foreign critics include proposals announced Thursday by an advisory council to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Forestry and Fisheries for a revision of the upper and lower ceilings on domestic beef and pork price supports, said a ministry official who requested anonymity. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON>, who is traveling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to discuss agricultural issues, is scheduled to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. An aide to <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON> declined to specify what new offers, if any, <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON> would make to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in an attempt to settle the dispute. Following the failure of working-level negotiations earlier this month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials gave <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> two weeks to come up with a satisfactory proposal to end the dispute. Otherwise, they said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may invoke a law calling for compensation from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to recall almost half a million 1985 cars and light trucks sold under the Chevrolet, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> and GMC nameplates, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said today. The cars exceed federal standards for carbon monoxide exhaust emissions and for evaporated gasoline, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Such orders are rare and are generally a sign the agency and the manufacturer could not agree on something, such as the cause of the problem, its scope, the necessary repair or terms of the recall. Most recalls are made voluntarily. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office said the company would have a statement later. The company has 45 days either to request a public hearing to contest the order, or to submit a repair plan for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s approval before notices are mailed to owners. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the affected vehicles are equipped with 5.0-liter -LRB- 305 cubic inches -RRB- and 5.7-liter -LRB- 350 cubic inches -RRB- engines and were sold as the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Impala </ORGANIZATION>, Caprice Classic, Camaro, <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camino </ORGANIZATION>; the Pontiac Firebird, <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, Grand Prix and <LOCATION> Parisienne </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caballero </ORGANIZATION>. Models sold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which are built to stricter standards, are included. The excessive emissions are in part the result of defects in a thermal vacuum switch in the evaporation control system, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. But the agency said simple replacement of the switch may not completely remedy the problem and further repairs, which it did not specify, may be necessary. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> recalled more than a million vehicles from the 1982 and 1983 model years for similar problems. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also is recalling about 4,900 1988 Chevrolet Corvettes to fix defective wheel welds that could cause the wheel center to separate from the rim during braking or cornering. The automaker said Wednesday it is also recalling about 460 1987 GMC and Chevrolet full-size vans to correct fuel tank filler pipes that could cause fuel to leak during refueling or turning. No accidents or injuries have been linked to either problem, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. Vehicle owners are being notified of the recall by dealers, who will correct the problems at no charge, the company said. The Corvettes, all equipped with 17-inch wheels, may be missing a weld on some wheels, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The condition could result in partial loss of steering control and a sudden changed in vehicle direction, the automaker said.

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines have no immediate plans to match <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' bold new move to ban smoking on most of its flights, and some industry analysts say the carriers are unlikely to do so. Northwest, the nation's fifth-largest airline, announced Wednesday it will prohibit smoking on all its domestic flights except those to and from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and on some foreign routes. The ban makes Minneapolis-based Northwest the first major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline to mandate a smoke-free environment in the air. It goes beyond federal regulations that will outlaw smoking on all domestic flights of two hours or less beginning April 23. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> said its prohibition was a response to passenger and employee requests. A.B. `` Sky'' <PERSON> Magary </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for marketing, told a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that while the policy is not without risk, `` we believe more nonsmokers will switch to Northwest than smokers will leave.'' Wall Street seemed unimpressed by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s smoke-free innovation. The airline's stock closed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at $ 45.75 a share, down 12 -LCB- cents from Tuesday. Some analysts believe <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> risks chasing away potential passengers, and other big airlines appear reluctant to follow the carrier's lead. `` We have no plans to follow that move,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Recent surveys conducted by American indicated a significant segment of people who want to smoke on planes, despite a growing demand for smoke-free areas, she said. American and several other big airlines contacted Wednesday stressed that they planned to establish no-smoking policies in line with the new federal law. Under those rules, passengers who insist on lighting up will face civil fines of as much as $ 1,000, and fliers who tamper with smoke alarms in airplane lavatories face up to $ 2,000 in penalties. `` We are ready to implement our no-smoking policy ... in line with the federal law,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>. United, the nation's largest airline, has had a smoking ban in place since Jan. 1 on all its flights within <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, in accordance with a state law. Fourth-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> has garnered a lot of support for its own <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> smoking ban, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s reaction to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s move was `` really tough to call,'' but did not rule out further action by his airline. `` We will of course take a look at what <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> is doing and see if we want to make an adjustment to our program,'' <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not expect the other carriers to match <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s policy. `` It's a gutsy move and most airlines do n't make gutsy moves,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` It could alienate some people.'' Three smokers, who were waiting to depart on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flights Wednesday from Minneapolis-St. <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, said they do n't object to the carrier's new smoking ban `` It's probably a good idea,'' <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> real estate broker, told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can get by without smoking.'' Even some <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, who are smokers, told the newspaper the new policy might help them quit smoking. The new policy, called `` Northwest Clears the Air,'' will take effect April 23, the same day as the new federal regulations. It will apply to flights within the contiguous 48 states and flights to and from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The longest flights covered by the smoking ban are four or five hours, according to the airline. About 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic flights and about 20 percent of all domestic flights last more than the two-hour duration covered by the new federal smoking regulations Northwest flights to and from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and overseas will continue offering smoking sections because those flights `` carry a greater proportion of foreign passengers who feel differently about the issue,'' the airline stated. `` We still have -LRB- foreign -RRB- competitors that are handing out cigars to passengers on board,'' <PERSON> Magary </PERSON> said. But even that could be changing. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a small British airline that flies to destinations in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is banning smoking on all its flights effective next Sunday. And a spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest airlines, said the carrier was looking `` quite seriously'' at the possibility of banning smoking on both short and long flights. The trend also has appeared in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unveiled plans Wednesday to introduce the first no-smoking commercial flights in the region next month. Smoking will be barred on four of the 14 daily shuttle flights between <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, starting April 4. The trip takes about 45 minutes.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened narrowly mixed today in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures were slightly lower. The market is caught in a tug-of-war between traders expecting seasonal price weakness to develop and those looking for new export business to push prices higher, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The corn and soybean markets were quiet and likely will stay that way through next Thursday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> releases its first estimates of this year's planted acreage, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. Recent volatility in the precious metals and currency futures markets has had surprisingly little impact on grain futures prices, probably because grain traders are beginning to look more at supply-and-demand fundamentals and paying less attention to the prices of other commodities, he said. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.06 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent higher across the board with May at $ 1.68 a bushel; soybeans were -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.40 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with April at 74.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent lower with March at 82.37 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .50 cent higher with April at 45.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with March at 55.40 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British brewing company, said Thursday its earnings more than quadrupled in 1987 due to extraordinary items. <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said it earned 474 million pounds, or $ 867 million, up from 113 million pounds in 1986. The company attributed the increase to one-time gains of 217 million pounds, including 29 million pounds of unauthorized payments relating to the April 1986 takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Sales fell 9 percent to 2.82 billion pounds from 3.1 billion pounds. Police have charged six people, including former <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, for alleged offenses related to the Distillers takeover. On Thursday, police arrested British stockbroker <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnes </PERSON> in connection with the Guinness scandal when he voluntarily returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after being held in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> jail for six months for extradition proceedings. <PERSON> Parnes </PERSON>, 42, who was arrested at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport, faces 19 charges including aiding and abetting the theft of money from the brewing company. He is accused of setting up and operating an illegal share support operation during the Guinness takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> has admitted it paid outsiders millions of pounds to buy <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> stock to make the brewer's cash and stock offer for <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>, a gin and whisky maker, more attractive than a rival bid.

 Former White House budget director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> is quitting the Wall Street giant <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to join the <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the smaller rival announced today. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, a managing director at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> since leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, will handle all merchant banking activities and merger transactions for the <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. His departure from <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> comes against a background of turmoil within the venerable investment firm, a partial result of the uncertain outlook for Wall Street in the aftermath of the stock market crash five months ago. Several other high-ranking executives also have quit <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> recently, although <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today as saying his departure was unrelated to the company's problems. `` My experience at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> was absolutely agreeable and I have a high regard for -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> chairman -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` ... There's one thing I could n't do there _ which is have my own shop.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>, said in a press statement that <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> will take charge of a jointly owned firm called `` <ORGANIZATION> Stockman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ a <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> affiliate.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> to bolster <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>'s emerging merchant banking business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> will be an immensely valuable asset in meeting that goal,'' he said. `` He brings a global perspective on business and financial issues as well as intimate familiarity with both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese government policies.'' <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> recently represented <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 2 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> late last year and represented <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in its $ 2.6 billion acquisition by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, 41, was White House budget director from 1981 to 1985

<TEXT>
 The for sale sign on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary has been taken down, but <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is pushing the parts-making company farther from the corporate nest `` The objective is to have it be much more independent, especially in the administration, so you do n't have a lot of people in <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> filing reports to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> about what they will be doing,'' said <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, vice president of public relations. The idea came up when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was reviewing whether to sell the $ 3 billion subsidiary, <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. The company backed away from selling <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union revolted and threatened strikes at <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> plants where local contracts were unresolved. The 10-month-old subsidiary has continued as a part of the company's structure and functioned almost as a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> department. `` One of the things we're contemplating in-house is ... why do n't we pretend we sold <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> and really treat them as a completely self-contained business responsible for their own bottom-line results and let them do whatever they have to do to get there?'' <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> financial results would be reported with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> still would handle the company's labor relations, but <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> no longer would report to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> administratively, <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. One reason <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> considered selling <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> was the expense of research and development necessary for competitive parts technology <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said part of <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy would involve buying new technology and forming partnerships with parts companies rather than developing new technology on its own. The idea has been endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee and <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> has been urged to complete the change quickly, he said. He declined to be more specific about a timetable. Of the Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> purchases more of its parts from outside suppliers than industry leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that disclosing names of foreign investors would damage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Proposals for some disclosure are in trade bills now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If enacted, the ... provision would have a chilling effect on foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ thereby costing jobs, raising interest rates, lowering productivity, closing off opportunities for technological and managerial improvements, and undermining our efforts to liberalize investments abroad,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. His opposition was in a written statement sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sponsors of the proposal, Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, came to a committee hearing and said they were sorry <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not appear in person. `` Not one of the G-7 countries -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> -RRB- has a publicly available national register of foreign investments of the type prescribed by <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote. `` Not one discloses to the public ongoing information about the status of specific private investors and their investments; not one requires systematic reporting by foreign investors or domestic firms for this purpose.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s views were challenged by <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, though he did not refer to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said most countries require more information than his bill is seeking, and in addition require their governments to clear investments in advance. His proposal does not seek that kind of clearance. `` Even <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> keeps a public registry of Swiss companies with foreign ownership,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s preclearance process seems one of the most stringent, in part because it is the most explicit ... <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> flatly prohibits foreign ownership of more than 25 percent in any of its high-tech companies.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brierly </PERSON> is offering $ 988 million to take over <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major construction materials and real estate concern with operations in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brierly </PERSON> made his unsolicited $ 40-per-share offer for the 81 percent of <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> he does not already own through a subsidiary of Australia-based <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> has 30.5 million shares outstanding. Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1984 by the merger of two construction industry giants _ <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Conrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The merged companies' core businesses are in cement, ready-mixed concrete, aggregate, hot-mixed asphalt and real estate holdings. <PERSON> Brierly </PERSON>'s offer sent <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION>'s stock soaring by $ 13.50 per share to $ 45.37 -LCB- in heavy trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The stock was up $ 1.87 | on Tuesday amid speculation the company might become a takeover target In a brief statement, <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> chief executive A.F. <PERSON> Gerstell </PERSON> said that in the past three years the company `` has taken significant steps ... to enhance shareholder value through the disposition of assets and the reallocation of proceeds to the company's higher-margin core businesses. In addition, <PERSON> Gerstell </PERSON> said, the company and its investment adviser, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have for some time been looking at `` additional, more aggressive steps which the company can take to continue this ongoing process.'' <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> intends to convene a special board meeting to compare <PERSON> Brierly </PERSON>'s offer with its own restructuring options, <PERSON> Gerstell </PERSON> said. In 1987, the company earned $ 78.1 million on revenue of $ 658.9 million. The profit included a $ 24 million gain on the sale of assets. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 44.1 million on revenue of $ 619 million. <PERSON> Gerstell </PERSON> has been <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, president and chief operating officer since the company was created. For the previous three years, he was presdient of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Cement. <ORGANIZATION> CalMat </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, was president of Conrock before the merger. <PERSON> Brierly </PERSON>, whose holdings range from real estate to oil and gas to financial services, characterizes himself as a long-term investor but not necessarily a passive one. In 1986, he made an unsuccessful bid to acquire control of Beverly Hills-based <ORGANIZATION> Wrather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, best known as the operator of the <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> and the Spruce Goose and Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> tourist attractions in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.

According to a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and others created false board minutes on the renewal and extension of some commercial real estate loans. The bogus minutes indicated the renewals and extensions had been approved by the board when no such approval had occurred. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> falsified documentation justifying $ 100,000 in payments to a consultant in connection with a loan from an S & amp; L, according to papers filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In addition, according to the felony information, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> conspired with a Vernon official to make $ 5,400 in illegal state and federal campaign contributions to specific candidates, based on the understanding that he would be reimbursed through false expense vouchers submitted to <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>. The contributions allegedly included $ 1,000 to former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> in February 1986, $ 2,000 to the <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> for Government campaign in April 1986, $ 400 to the campaign of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, in September 1985, and $ 2,000 to Citizens for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in June 1986.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the airplane engine maker privatized by the government last year, on Thursday reported a 12 percent increase in its net profit for 1987.

 Business phone costs held steady in the first three months of 1987, the first quarter since 1984 in which they have have not fallen, according to a report Thursday.

<HEAD>State Fighting Suit That Could Cost $140 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A court challenge to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tax on insurance premiums and annuities will decide whether the Department of Revenue owes out-of-state insurance companies $ 140 million in refunds. The companies do n't like the way the state currently assesses taxes on money that consumers pay to insurers _ a 2 percent tax on premiums and 1 percent tax on annuities. The tax is paid only by out-of-state companies, not by Florida-based insurers. The out-of-state companies say that is n't fair, and many of them have asked for refunds The law was changed last year to require all insurance companies, including those based in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to pay the premium insurance tax, but that change wo n't take effect until July 1. The state targeted one case _ <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ to be a test case in circuit court. `` If -LRB- the case -RRB- comes down in our favor, we'll be all right financially,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, one of three state agencies in the case. `` If not, there's a lot of money involved.'' New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> sought a refund of $ 1.5 million that it paid in taxes in 1983, 1984 and 1985. It is one of 210 companies that have filed for a total of $ 140 million in refunds _ an amount roughly equal to the entire budget for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's substantial,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which is handling the case. In its refund claim, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> argued that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1985 that such disriminatory taxing policies were unconstitutional. According to the state comptroller's office, out-of-state insurance companies have filed claims to recover taxes paid as long ago as the mid-1970s. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> argued on the state's behalf that the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tax law should be considered legal until courts rule on its constitutionality. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also claimed that the out-of-state insurance companies passed along the tax to consumers through its premiums and refunding the money would unjustly enrich the companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> is involved because the comptroller rules on requests for tax refunds. The Department of Revenue both collects the tax and makes the refunds, while the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> regulates the insurance industry.

 The dollar continued to slide Thursday, reaching levels against the Japanese yen and West German mark not seen for two months as a bearish sentiment pervaded currency markets. Gold prices firmed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 453.15 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from Wednesday's late bid of $ 451.15 an ounce. Traders said the dollar continued to suffer from comments made Wednesday by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, former chief economic advisor to the president, who said the currency should fall to 120 yen in the near term. In an address at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> also predicted the dollar would decline against other currencies over the next several years. `` Those comments are not new, but they triggered losses'' in the dollar, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar, which closed at 125.575 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, last traded at that level in mid-January. Traders said the yen continues to strengthen ahead of the close of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 and on the expectation that the Japanese economy will forge ahead. The dollar also weakened somewhat on government reports that personal income grew 0.9 percent in February and that personal consumption expenditures grew 0.7 percent during the month. The figures indicated that consumer spending is picking up again, which likely will result in wider trade deficits, said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> EBC-Amro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> echoed that sentiment, saying that the `` mildly bearish sentiment'' toward the dollar is being spurred by `` the realization that there will be larger trade deficits later in the year.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar closed at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a lower rate of 125.75 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.8435 from Wednesday's $ 1.8358 In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8420 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.83725.

Gold prices moved mostly higher.

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply jumped in mid-March, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The report had no impact on interest rates in the credit markets, however. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 11.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 2,965.5 billion in the week ended March 14 from $ 2,954.3 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 14.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,740.3 billion from $ 3,725.5 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 4.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 760.5 billion from $ 755.8 billion. For the latest 13 weeks, M1 rose 2.6 percent to an average of $ 755.7 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In setting its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.

<HEAD>Silver, Copper Futures Surge On GNP Growth, Inflation Signals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices for future delivery of silver and copper posted steep gains Thursday on expections of increasing demand among industrial users of the metals. Gold futures prices also advanced on perceptions of rising inflation. On other markets, soybean futures surged while grain futures were mixed; stock-index futures fell; energy futures and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Wednesday's government figures showing the economy grew at a higher-than-expected 4.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1987 had a delayed impact on silver and copper futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON>, a metals analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> `` Silver and copper are industrial metals that have to play catch-up on the upside now following the GNP report,'' <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON> said. `` What the government is saying is contrary to the majority of expectations: the economy did not slow to a grinding halt but gathered upward momentum, and that's very positive for industrial metals.'' Silver, which is also a precious metal and thus perceived as an investment hedge against inflation, also gained in reaction to generally higher futures prices for other commodities, <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodity markets gained 1.25 points Thursday, a moderate advance. Analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the silver rally to Far Eastern buying of the metal and to the dollar's decline in value against foreign currencies. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> also noted that copper is in short supply. Tight supplies of copper have been cited to explain the metal's steady increase in value since late February. Copper settled .50 cent to 6.25 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.1395 a pound. Gold settled $ 2.20 to $ 3 higher with April at $ 454.30 a troy ounce; silver was 12.5 cents to 13.4 cents higher with March at $ 6.735 a troy ounce. The silver rally may have sparked buying interest in soybean futures, which gained as much as 9 -LCB- cents a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Grains were mixed. `` There was no new fundamental news during the session but sometimes the soybeans will trade with the precious metals markets,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The grain markets had looked strong before today and the rise in silver prices may have led to inflationary ideas,'' he said. Expectations that the dollar will remain weak, making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper overseas, may also have supported the soybean market, he said. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents lower with May at $ 3.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with May at $ 2.07 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.68 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 9 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.49 \ Stock-index futures tumbled on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 6.30 points lower at 264.10. Stock and stock-index futures prices opened sharply lower in reaction to the dollar's weakness and continued to fall throughout the session, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Oil prices finished mixed in moderate trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting uncertainty over the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing committee's ability to calm the turbulent market, analysts said The group meets next month to discuss stabilizing sagging prices.

Cattle futures finished mostly lower and pork futures were mostly higher in a day of choppy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Traders were wary of the sharp drop in stock prices, fearing a repeat of the cattle market collapse that followed the stock market's historic plunge in October, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everbody was keeping an eye on the indexes and what the stock market was doing,'' he said.

 The losing side vowed to fight on Thursday after a federal bankruptcy judge approved an $ 11 million settlement in a case involving three zeros accidentally dropped from some financial documents. `` We have not given up the ship, so to speak,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayerson </PERSON>, a lawyer representing a major creditor in the Chapter 11 proceedings of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION>, a moribund shipping company, and its parent <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> agreed this week to pay about $ 11 million to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION> to settle legal claims stemming from a clerical error in which a mortgage lien <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> held on eight ships, worth $ 92,885,000, was recorded as worth $ 92,885 <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the money to keep <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION> and other creditors from challenging the full amount of the lien. Ms. <PERSON> Mayerson </PERSON> said her client, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which shared a second mortgage on the ships, would press its challenge in <ORGANIZATION> Admiralty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and might even appeal the ruling Thursday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Buschman </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. If <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> can convince a judge that <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s lien is really worth only $ 92,885, it will get a bigger portion of the more than $ 60 million in net proceeds raised by the sale of the eight ships. The oddity of a clerical error costing <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 11 million attracted widespread attention to the case. But it was not a major case in the legal annals, said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirshon </PERSON>, a lawyer for another creditor, Sea-going Benefit Plans, which went along with the settlement. `` This is not <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hirshon </PERSON> said, referring to the landmark 1954 school desegregation case.

 Pharmaceutical giant <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday launched a $ 32-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which already has accepted a bid from Corning Glass Works. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> valued its offer for the clinical testing firm at $ 340 million, which includes the assumption of debt. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> owns about 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> ICL </ORGANIZATION>'s 7.6 million outstanding shares. In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> ICL </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 8 to close at $ 33.75 a share. <ORGANIZATION> ICL </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, announced earlier this month that it reached a definitive agreement to be acquired by <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> MetPath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for $ 26 a share, or about $ 260 million A spokesman at Corning headquarters in <LOCATION> Corning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, had no comment on whether the company might increase its bid. Analysts said, however, that <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>, which earned $ 162.2 million last year, is financially capable of challenging <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>. `` Corning can go considerably higher if they found it worthwhile,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Under terms of its merger agreement, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> has an option to buy 3 million unissued <ORGANIZATION> ICL </ORGANIZATION> shares as well as `` all the shares owned by certain directors and officers'' for $ 26 each. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the directors and officers hold 800,000 shares, which would value the options at about $ 99 million. Companies sometimes grant such `` lock-up'' options to keep others at bay by making a subsequent bids more expensive. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that the offer is `` consistent with our corporate strategy to invest in our key businesses and will build on the success of our clinical laboratories network.'' <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, the company's clinical laboratory segment headquartered in King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, operates 22 regional laboratories. It reported sales of $ 431 million last year. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> is `` No. 1, and they want to get even bigger'' by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> ICL </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> MetPath </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Teterboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, operates a testing laboratory there as well as 12 others nationwide <ORGANIZATION> ICL </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 clinical testing laboratories are located in the South and West.

<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, snubbed in his $ 770 million takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sought Wednesday to turn up the heat in his fight for the entertainment concern. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he would consider other `` alternative courses of action'' if <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> continues to hold merger talks only with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based entertainment conglomerate. A Lorimar spokesman said those options included filing suit against <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> or making a hostile tender offer. Noting that the price of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> stock has risen more than 50 percent since <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> disclosed on March 3 that it was talking with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` I believe you have passed the point of no return ... It is time to quickly and efficiently provide equal access -LRB- to non-public information -RRB- to all serious bidders.'' He added, `` It is upsetting to me, as it must be to all shareholders, that only one of the parties interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> LT </ORGANIZATION> has had the opportunity to inspect its books and records.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is offering $ 17 per share for <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>'s 45.3 million shares. No details of the price being discussed by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has been disclosed, but analysts have estimated could fetch a price in the high teens. The company's stock closed unchanged at $ 15 a share Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also indicated that he owned a `` substantial block'' of <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION> stock. A spokesman said it was less than the 5 percent which an investor must disclose and most, if not all, of the stock was acquired before <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made his takeover proposal on March 7. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Binford </PERSON> said Wednesday that the company had no comment on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' announcement and declined to comment on the status of talks with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' proposal in rather summary fashion just hours after it was disclosed two weeks ago, saying only that it `` would bear <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' letter in mind.'' <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is a leading producer of original television programming, but in recent years has been troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into other areas have disintegrated and sometimes caused hevy losses for the company. In the first nine months of its current fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 82.6 million on revenues of $ 616.8 million. The deficit included $ 45 million in writedowns on five movies and $ 22 million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video unit.

<HEAD>Motorola To Pay $16.7 Million In Fines For Navy Mischarges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s electronics group has agreed to pay the government $ 16.7 million and to plead guilty to a criminal information accusing it of mischarging for labor and materials on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> satellite and missile contracts, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. In documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was accused of inflating costs for a component of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> satellite communications and mischarging $ 2.5 million in labor, materials and other costs The money actually was spent on other work, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, relying on the inflated amounts, paid some $ 5 million more than it should have on a second contract for the satellite communications system, said the government. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's top 50 defense contractors, agreed to plead guilty to three counts of making false statements. The firm said in a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, that `` it is now clear in retrospect'' that the electronics group's `` systems were not adequate to ensure total compliance with applicable laws and regulations.'' `` The conduct of the employees involved in these programs failed to conform to <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s own internal standards,'' the statement added. The electronics group `` has greatly expanded its compliance efforts'' with reforms which `` are now an integral part of the way GEG does business.'' Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a court, the government has agreed not to prosecute the company further on the contracts, but reserves the right to prosecute individuals. The court documents also say the firm mischarged labor costs for work on 10 contracts involving production of target detecting devices for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Standard missile. The third count in the criminal information said <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> mischarged labor costs on a contract for the production of targeting detecting devices for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 16.7 million in criminal fines, restitution and civil penalties. The company already has paid $ 6.8 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The pleas result from an investigation into labor and materials charging and pricing practices by <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> from 1979 to 1984.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television station said Thursday it was dropping <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s Lord, <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Federico </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> unit as its advertising agency, and another Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> client said it would review its ad assignment. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court judge set a hearing for Monday on the agency's request for an injunction against a half-dozen former top <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> executives who left the agency abruptly last week to start their own ad firm. The executives have indicated they felt constrained under the management of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the British firm that acquired <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> in July 1987. Since the executives quit, about 20 other Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> employees have followed their former bosses to the new agency, Lord, <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> & amp; Partners. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> has filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to try to prevent the former executives from signing its clients and hiring its workers for their new agency. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> employs more than 300 people and handles billings of about $ 245 million. Billings are what companies spend on advertising; agencies usually get a percentage of billings for their work. <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television station that has been a client of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> for four years, said it had notified <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>, that it was assigning its ad business to the new agency. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipman </PERSON>, director of advertising and promotions for the station, said station executives felt they had built up a special relationship with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, the former chairman and chief executive of <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> who resigned to start the new firm, and would be `` better serviced'' at the new agency. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Elmsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it was planning to review its advertising accounts now being handled by <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> is the agency for <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> divisions that market audio and video tape and floppy disks. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, advertising manager for <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic products division, said the decision was made `` after studying recent changes at the agency.'' He said <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> planned to invite specific agencies to participate in the review but declined to say if Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> or Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> would be invited. Neither <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> would say how much they billed through Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>. A third Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> client, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine, has already indicated that it plans to drop the agency and sign on with the new firm. Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s biggest account is <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> reportedly accounts for about half of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>'s total billings, and has said it is `` concerned'' about recent events at the agency and has told the agency so.
