 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> on Monday ridiculed reports he was involved in misusing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money. `` Can you imagine that if I had ... -LRB- $ 2 million -RRB- I would still be in this country?,'' he asked. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s son denied he was trying to protect <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> who was reported under investigation in the case. `` I deny any tie because I am not protecting him and because I am against corruption,'' said <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, candidate for mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the March 20 elections. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> is being investigated for allegedly misusing up to $ 2 million of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. It said the money was part of a $ 10 million program to assist war-ravaged areas and help win the support of Salvadorans in the war against leftist rebels. The newspaper quoted unidentified Salvadoran and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying it could be the largest case of theft of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money during the administration of President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, elected in May 1984 for a five-year term. In an interview with local newspapers, <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said `` that news -LRB- about alleged misuse of funds -RRB- surprises me because it is totally false.'' <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s vice president and secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the article was `` full of vagueness and imprecisions with the political intention of damaging the party.'' He said it was written `` within a strategic conception of the ultra-right of the country.'' He also read a communique saying the party backed <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> as `` an absolutely honorable, capable and honest man.'' Referring to allegations against <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, the communique said `` we abstain from making a value judgment because we do not know if there is evidence.'' <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> denied being an associate of <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> and said he had urged <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> to cooperate with any investigation. `` It is vital that the truth be arrived at,'' he told reporters. `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> -RRB- is clean, he does not have to be afraid. If he feels he is outside of the accusations, then he should submit himself to any investigation.'' `` All this is a dirty political game and I feel indignant for having been involved,'' <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. Asked about his relationship with <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, he replied, `` I have no personal friendship with him. I know him like the majority of the members of the party.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> resigned three months ago as director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Areas </ORGANIZATION>, but President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> agreed to allow him to become a party candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on the recommendation of <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` these allegations are being studied.'' `` At this time the inspector general of AID -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has made no determination of bad use of funds in this program,'' the source said. `` However, other recent studies have identified certain aspects of financial control and management of CONARA -LRB- the restoration commission -RRB- and since January of this year there have been some changes in the method of management.'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> said the party asked for an investigation of the alleged theft of funds. If there is evidence it occurred, the party will ask the assembly to remove the immunity <ORGANIZATION> Merida </ORGANIZATION> enjoys as a substitute deputy and will ask the electoral council to revoke his candidacy, he said.

<TEXT>
 Two French-cooking schools _ one the oldest, the other the newest _ are giving the world's gastronomic capital yet another culinary lift. Cordon Bleu, the oldest and most prestigious, has taken on a high-tech image at a new location in a five-story building that once was an infirmary. The luxurious Ritz Hotel, the newest, is opening its kitchens April 5 to students of haute cuisine. The cachet of the elegant <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> hotel is maintained in the decor of its new basement cooking school, where gleaming white-tiled spaces and hand-painted murals set the tone. The Cordon Bleu, long situated in cramped quarters in the classy Champ de Mars district under the Eiffel Tower, moved in January to the building on an anonymous corner of the 15th arrondissement in southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The school where servants from affluent families long ago watched cooking demonstrations in an amphitheater now offers every high-tech amenity, including video screens. Both schools offer all levels of instruction up to professional. Despite the new home, tradition at the venerable Cordon Bleu remains intact. The top diploma at the Cordon Bleu is awarded to students who pass a nine-month session. The Ritz school's top diploma follows a 12-week course. Hardly a newcomer to fine food, the Ritz has been known for its cuisine since <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Escoffier </PERSON> attracted international gastronomes early in the century. It decided to spread its know-how as part of an overall renovation plan started by <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Fayed </PERSON>, the Egyptian entrepreneur who bought the hotel nine years ago. `` We feel we're offering unique and superior instruction for a private cooking school,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Usher </PERSON>, an American who left the <ORGANIZATION> Cordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bleu </ORGANIZATION> to take over the Ritz school's administration. `` Our chefs are tops.'' The courses are to be supervised by three of the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION>'s own chefs, all winners of the top professional award, <PERSON> Meilleur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouvrier </PERSON> de <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Most daily courses will be handled by two chefs with credentials from prestigious <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurants. One, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillut </PERSON>, perfected his English while working at restaurants like l'Orangerie and <ORGANIZATION> Ma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuisine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The up-to-date equipment includes permanently cooled pastry marbles, the latest in ovens, freezers and mixers. The hotel's meat smoker will be used for `` charcuterie'' courses, and video outlets are available for taping recipes. Pupils can browse in a reference library, taste wine with the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION>'s sommelier, and the change and shower after the course in a special area. Across the Seine at Cordon Bleu, in the business since 1896, it's a whole new world. Spanking clean in light greys and blues, today's big-scale school includes two demonstration rooms, four huge cooking and pastry rooms, and a beautiful winter garden. Equipment includes convection ovens, pastry-rising ovens and huge dough-kneaders, plus special machines for a new course on vacuum-packing and cooking _ to be taught by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the 1987 winner of the French National Cuisine and Pastry trophy. `` We're still emphasizing traditional <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cuisine,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a Cordon Bleu graduate and its spokeswoman. `` But in our expanded facilities just about everything is new.'' `` The basics are still the main point,'' said <PERSON> Chef </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, one of seven chefs. `` The students will still learn how to chop, knead, whip and do everything else by hand as well.'' The overwhelming majority of Cordon Bleu students are from abroad _ about 30 percent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and 20 percent Japanese, said Ms. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>. While the Ritz plans English translations in all courses, the Cordon Bleu still teaches its advanced courses in French. Financing for the modernization comes from the Pages group, headed by <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cointreau </PERSON>, which bought the school in 1981. Intermediate students at the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> may choose a one-to-six week course of practical sessions and demonstrations at cost in French francs of about $ 800 a week. The Ritz's highest-level <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Escoffier </PERSON> course, a 12-week session, costs about $ 10,000. Cordon Bleu's main three 12-week courses comprise a cycle of `` basic'' through `` superior'' at a cost of about $ 4,200 each. To get the coveted Cordon Bleu Grand Diplome, pupils now spend nine months, reduced from 12, in intensive cooking and pastry courses preparing for the big exam, at a cost of $ 19,000. `` We're also offering new intensive four-day practical and demonstration sessions,'' ranging from charcuterie to regional cuisine and costing about $ 500, said Ms. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>. Both schools conduct wine tasting courses. A visitor to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who wants to compare the big-school ambience of the Cordon Bleu with the tonier <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON> can attend demonstrations at either one for less than $ 35 each.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and two former managers pleaded innocent Monday to charges that they overbilled the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> by $ 450,000 on a sophisticated satellite navigational system. In a brief hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> ordered the company and its former managers to file pretrial motions by April 4 and set a May 3 trial date, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Charney </PERSON> said.

The company and the former managers _ <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, materials division director at the its Seal Beach plant, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavodnick </PERSON>, manager of major subcontracts within the division _ were named in a 25-count federal indictment in January. The indictment alleged that the company and two men double-billed the government for work on the NAVSTAR global navigational system that uses radio signals from satellites to pinpoint locations on earth. As a result, the indictment claimed, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> received $ 450,000 in unlawful profits. The company has denied the allegations.

 Militant monks in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and restive Armenians in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are among the minority nationalities in those countries now testing, sometimes with violence, the limits of their governments' professed policies of openness. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> calls them `` hooligans.'' To <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> they are `` splittists.'' But to both countries they represent a threat to the reputation and unity of the state. Thirty-one people died last week in rioting in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, where Christian Armenians are unhappy about being part of mostly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, up to 23 have died in clashes between <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police and Tibetans in October and over the weekend. In both countries, the Communist governments in the past have suppressed their minorities to unite vast tracts of land under the ruling ethnic group, the <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the Russians in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> purged the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> in the 1930s, and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> swiftly cracked down on unrest in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and Moslem west <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 1950s and 1960s. Both countries, with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the lead, have now declared greater tolerance for different views, exposing both to flashpoints of nationalist sentiment. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> blames outside forces for its troubles, saying pro-independence supporters of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled religious leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, were responsible for the first outbreak of violence in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> last October. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is faced with a wider problem of ethnic disputes in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, religious identity in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> and political activism in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Foreign journalists in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have had slightly better access to the troubled areas than their Moscow-based counterparts. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expelled 14 foreign journalists from <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> last October, and has since given permission for only a few to return. But <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> authorities, hungry for tourist spending to help <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s poorest province, have not stopped group tours, and some reporters have joined excursion groups to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> let a few correspondents go to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, on a Foreign Ministry-sponsored trip for a planned demonstration to mark the Feb. 16 declaration of independence. But reporters there were followed constantly. No foreign journalist has been allowed lately into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Telephone calls to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> sometimes went through, but <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the center of the Armenian-Azeri dispute, can not be reached at all and <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> only rarely. Reflecting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s `` glasnost'' and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s similar policy of `` kaifang,'' the official media in both countries have carried limited reports of the disturbances. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s press has stressed that only a small number of Tibetans have joined the disturbances, and has sent out a barrage of stories about Tibetans criticizing the separatists and saying how much better life is under socialism. The government has stressed that it will continue to respect the local customs and help alleviate poverty in the regions where the nation's 67 million non-Han minorities live. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, too, has linked the rioting to a small number of `` hooligans.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, however, in a Feb. 18 speech stressed the importance of working out a new policy on nationalities and said the <ORGANIZATION> Cental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would hold a special plenary session to discuss the matter.

 An Army private who flew his small airplane into prohibited airspace over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ranch must spend 30 weekends in jail. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, convicted of lying to authorities about the reason he strayed into prohibited airspace on Aug. 13, was sentenced Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON>.

He later said he had lied about the lens because, `` I was trying to stay out of more trouble.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> was demoted from private first class to private for being absent without leave.

<TEXT>
 A group of men backing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new government seized control of the country's disputed consulate in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Monday night by smashing through the glass door with a Land Rover, police reported. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the seizure took place because the consul in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arango </PERSON>, refused to give up his post despite being fired by the new government. Control of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is also in dispute following the ouster on Feb. 26 of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. He was removed from office after he tried to dismiss Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the military leader and de facto ruler. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> consulate is about a mile east of the embassy. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> was not in the consulate when the raid occurred. Police said in a statement that six men _ two representatives of Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> and four members of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> security firm _ smashed their way into the consulate. `` Shortly after this, several people left the building, including three women believed to be secretaries, and a number of security staff. One glass-paneled front door was damaged and no one was injured as a result of the incident,'' the statement added. One of the staff members forced out of the consulate, Tourism Commissioner <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, 24, said: `` We were just working in there and then suddenly we heard a crash.'' He said the Land Rover broke through the glass doors and then a group of men burst into the building carrying large hammers. `` They threatened us with hammers and one tried to hit my face. They took my passport and documents. Then they pushed me down the stairs and out of the building,'' <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police sealed off the area around the consulate in <LOCATION> Tudor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in the City, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many other countries still consider <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> the president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He was removed from office by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which is dominated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last month on drug trafficking charges. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the time of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster and has said he helped smuggle <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> from his residence to a hiding place in the Central American country. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> received a phone call at home from the consulate staff about the Monday night raid. The agency quoted <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> as saying he was prevented from entering the consulate after the attack and that one of the men occupying it had told him they were working for <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> and carrying out orders from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. British government officials said they were told last Friday that <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> was being fired as consul. <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> said he had received letters from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> saying he was dismissed but had ignored them, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. As workmen repaired the doors, one of the British security guards who took part in the raid said: `` It is an exaggeration to say we smashed in. We nudged the doors with the Land Rover. The police say they may prosecute us for mounting the pavement -LRB- sidewalk -RRB- but I do n't think they can do anything else. We were authorized to enter the building but I can not divulge any more.'' The four guards involved work for GB Security, a private security company based in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. They said they would be guarding the building overnight. A spokesman at the British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, who in accordance with British practice declined to be named, said it was too early to say what action, if any, Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> might take over the incident.

 At least one policeman was killed and 28 injured in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> over the weekend in clashes between police and protesters demanding <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The newspaper, the voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, quoted <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s top police official in its report on rioting Saturday in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> The newspaper did not say how many Tibetans were injured. Unconfirmed reports from Western sources in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> said three to nine people were killed, including one <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk and two Chinese police officers. Western sources contacted in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> said the city was quiet today and Sunday but that the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, around which Tibetans battled police, was closed. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said stores were open and marketplace stalls were doing business today. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, meanwhile, 500 Tibetan refugees, chanting `` We shall overcome,'' demonstrated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> today against the Chinese crackdown in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. Police prevented the demonstrators from going to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. No injuries were reported in sporadic clashes between protesters and police. The demonstration was organized by <ORGANIZATION> Tibetan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of self-exiled Tibetans, and the Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has allowed 120,000 Tibetans and their temporal leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, to stay in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959 after an abortive Tibetan uprising against the Chinese. The People's Daily today quoted the Tibetan police official, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, as saying on Tibetan television Sunday that the disturbances in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> began when `` separatists'' infiltrated a crowd on the final day of a 10-day prayer festival. He said they started shouting `` independence for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'' and other `` counter-revolutionary'' slogans. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said 20 to 30 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks circled the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, shouting slogans and throwing stones and damaging Chinese television vans. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> earlier gave the number as 60. They also attacked the Tibetan branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and set fire to a car belonging to the group, controlled by the Chinese government. `` Their purpose was to destroy the peace and unity of our country and our region and the peaceful and prosperous life of all nationalities -LRB- in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he was quoted as saying. The report did not say how many Tibetans took part in the riots or if there were any arrests. Saturday was the first outbreak of violence since last Oct. 1, when 2,000 Tibetans, led by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, set fire to a police station facing the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. Police opened fire, and at least 14 people were killed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an integral part of the nation for centuries, moved troops into the remote mountain region in 1950. Many Tibetans deeply resent the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government because of oppression of Tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of temples during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. Although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has tried to redress past wrongs, friction remains between the Tibetans and the Hans, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ethnic majority, which continues to hold many senior posts in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today that rioters `` stormed, looted and set fire to shops and restaurants and beat up policemen sent to maintain order.'' It said rioters with steel bars and wooden sticks knocked down policemen Yuan Shisheng and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuchen </PERSON>, stabbed them and threw them from a second-floor window. Yuan, a 22-year-old Tibetan, died later in a hospital and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> was reported in serious condition. The Western sources said Tibetans set fire to vehicles and lit bonfires over a 12-hour period, and that police fired tear gas during the day to control the violence. Gunshots were heard after dark, they said. The <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> government has turned down almost all requests by foreign journalists to visit <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and has restricted tourism to the area since the disturbances last October.

The January trade report is due to be released March 17 and one dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said the market will be paralyzed until then. `` We just move along from trade figure to trade figure,'' he said.

 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> thrilled spectators by shaking hands on both sidelines after beating an American polo squad assembled for the royal occasion. `` I ca n't believe it. I was so shocked,'' said <PERSON> Anabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariaca </PERSON>, who shook hands with the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> after the 90-minute match Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I told him I was from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, and he said, ` I bet the weather is better there than here.''' The prince's <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> team beat <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> 6-4 on a soggy field doused by occasional rain. The prince, scheduled to fly home today via <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, scored a goal on a penalty shot, and teammate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> saved five or six goals on defense. `` He played very well,'' <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> said. `` He had n't played in competition since the end of August, but he made some beautiful back shots.'' Spectators included King Constantine of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and Maj. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, father-in-law of Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' younger brother. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, had other commitments, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, finished a 10-day tour of Southern California Sunday and headed back to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Officials said the prince's visit with spectators afterward was unplanned but not unusual. To the fans, however, it was clearly a surprise. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeiser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, who shook hands with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, apologized to him for the weather. `` Well, I'll have to come back again,'' replied the prince, who has visited the club twice before. About 8,500 people attended the match at the 6,200-seat stadium. Both the sporting event and a luncheon for about 500 people beforehand benefitted Friends of the <PERSON> Masai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON>, a conservation group for a wildlife habitat in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The founders of the organization, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, were the prince's hosts and the first to greet the prince and king when they flew in Saturday from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where they had attended a fund-raising dinner Friday. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who has been outspoken recently about architecture, went from the airport to visit developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s 118-room mansion <ORGANIZATION> Mar-a-Lago </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> spent two nights at the Kents' ranch west of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was the honored guest at a wildlife demonstration conducted on the polo field by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> of TV's `` Wild Kingdom,'' who presented a lion cub, aardvark, several birds and a 7-year-old cheetah. When <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> coaxed an eagle to fly to him by holding up scraps of food, the prince asked, `` Is that off the luncheon menu?'' The eagle landed on the back of <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s hand with a message in its claw. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who read it to the audience, said, `` All wildlife thanks those gathered here for your interest in wildlife.'' The prince joked, `` I did n't know this eagle could write, though clearly it does.'' Cheetah handler <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilker </PERSON> took <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' right hand, and together they petted the cat's face. The prince seemed reluctant, but the animal licked his hand. `` She loves men's hands because they have hair on them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hilker </PERSON> explained.

<HEAD>Demands For Religious Freedom After Packed Mass</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Roman Catholics chanted `` We want religious freedom!'' after thousands crowded into a cathedral for a Mass honoring a 13th-century Czech princess who renounced royal wealth to serve God. The Mass on Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vitus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, in the Castle complex where Communist President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> lives, drew about 8,000 people. It was one of the biggest religious services in the capital since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover in 1948 and an indication of the reviving strength of the nation's Roman Catholic church. Dozens of plainclothes security officers were seen inside and outside the cathedral while Mass was held to honor the princess who is to be canonized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> later this year. Police arrested 16 dissidents and religious activists under 48-hour detention orders on Friday and Saturday, apparently to prevent them from attending the Mass. A dissident source said five people remained in detention Sunday night, but four of them were expected to be freed today. <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navratil </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic activist from <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>, was detained Friday morning but there was no word he was free late Sunday, the source said. <PERSON> Navratil </PERSON> was the author of a 31-point church petition for more religious freedom that has gained more than 300,000 signatures, making it the largest such action in the Soviet bloc since 1945. Five other dissidents were briefly detained when they tried to visit a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat Friday, and two others also were briefly held that night. After the Mass, about 1,000 people went from the cathedral to the nearby residence of Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>. A few hundred chanted `` We want bishops,'' `` We want religious freedom'' and `` We want the Pope.'' The chanting crowd appeared to reflect growing discontent among Catholics at the lack of bishops in 10 of the country's 13 sees. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has refused to accept government proposals to appoint as bishops members of the state-sponsored Pacem in <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION> organization, a group of priests not recognized by the Holy See. `` Long live the Holy Father'' was another chant from the crowd outside <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s residence, which adjoins the castle where <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> lives. The presidential flag was flying, indicating the 75-year-old president was home during the unusual demonstration. There is no official estimate of the number of believers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials estimate about 60 percent of the 15.5 million citizens are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>University's Pre-Payment Plan Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Falling bond interest rates and unexpectedly high tuition increases have forced <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to suspend a trendsetting tuition prepayment plan, according to school officials. The small Roman Catholic university announced three years ago that alumni could enroll their newborn children for $ 4,450 as full tuition payment for four years of education. The plan was expanded in 1986 to include non-alumni. The college takes the money and invests it, with the proceeds covering tuition for four years of college when the child is grown. The plan prompted about a dozen other private colleges to follow suit. Six states also adopted plans that would enable parents to prepay a fixed amount of the child's college tuition, starting at birth. <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rago </PERSON> confirmed Sunday that the university's board of trustees had voted Wednesday to suspend the plan. `` When we began the program, it was a much different economic climate, but things have changed so we decided to suspend it,'' she said. The college will keep its commitment to 622 families already enrolled in the program, Ms. <PERSON> Rago </PERSON> said. When the plan was created, according to Ms. <PERSON> Rago </PERSON>, the university's rate of return on the bonds was 10.8 percent. It has since dropped to 8.52 percent, she said. Tuition for 1988-89 recently was raised 8 percent, rather than the originally projected 6 percent. The university found it would be necessary to raise the 1987 tuition prepayment for a newborn to $ 8,630. That was calculated to cover tuition costs of $ 102,604 over four years, ending in the year 2005. For a 15-year-old, the one-time investment rose from $ 12,864 to $ 24,310. `` At this time, those numbers do n't make the plan feasible,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rago </PERSON> said. `` The administration will re-examine it if the economic conditions change.''

<TEXT>
 Hungarian intellectuals and a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have called on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to allow more ethnic Hungarian refugees to emigrate from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and appealed for international support in monitoring their rights. About 20 people spoke at the all-day forum Sunday in a theater in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. More than 700 people attended the meeting, participants informed The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from the Hungarian capital. The meeting Sunday was the second one of the `` Democratic Forum'' since the group was formed on Sept. 27 in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The document issued at the September meeting called for `` genuinely effective reform'' to resolve <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic and social problems. The meetings are unusual in communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> because authorities, although they have not officially recognized the forum, have not prevented them from taking place, and the results have been discussed in the official press. Most of the speakers Sunday focused on the ethnic Hungarian minority in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies but have engaged in increasingly sharp rhetoric over the question of the ethnic Hungarian minority in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> in recent months. <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> was ruled by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> before World War I, and both nations claim the area is the cradle of their national cultures and history. Hungarian officials say increasing numbers of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s nearly 2 million ethnic Hungarians have sought refuge in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoecs </PERSON>, an ethnic Hungarian poet from <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> who now lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, suggested that the Hungarian government consider allowing a certain quota of ethnic Hungarians from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> emigrate to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He suggested the quota correlate to the number of Hungarians who apply for asylum in the West each year, as well as the general decline of the population through the sinking birthrate. However, <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, warned against establishing a refugee program that would help Romanian Communist leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> get rid of the Hungarian minority. Ethnic Hungarians have said they are increasingly restricted in the use of their language and expression of their culture in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, which denies the charges and accuses <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of meddling in its affairs. <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON> told the gathering he and five other parliamentarians drafted a resolution calling on the government to set up a settlement fund for Transylvanian Hungarians who wish to stay in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He said the draft resolution, which is to be put before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> when it meets in spring session later this month, also calls on the government to seek the cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and to mobilize international public opinion. <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON>, one of the most outspoken members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said many Hungarians who enter <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> go on to third countries because the Hungarian authorities are not prepared to receive them. He said many of these ethnic Hungarians, if given the chance, would opt to stay in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> because of the cultural affinity.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Single women are changing their attitudes about sexual relationships because of the threat of getting AIDS, according to a poll conducted for People magazine. The national telephone survey, conducted by Market Facts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, asked 500 women ages 18 to 49 about the impact of AIDS, the magazine reported in this week's issue. The survey found that the threat was on their minds even though the medical community has said very few AIDS cases have occurred outside of the known risk groups, which include homosexuals and intravenous drugs users, People said. The poll found that 75 percent said they were extremely or very concerned and 40 percent said their sex lives had been directly affected. Of those who said their sex lives have changed, 78 percent said they've become more choosy about sex partners and three-fourths said they want to know a new partner's sexual history and insist that he use a condom, the poll said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 Survivors and those who lost loved ones in a ferry disaster retraced the voyage of the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, casting wreaths and notes over the spot where it capsized a year before. `` Daddy, Miss You,'' said one of the more than 100 cards dropped into the water Sunday, a cold, bleak day with a fine drizzle _ remarkably similar to the day the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> turned over and 193 of its passengers died. Others joined in prayer Sunday in this Belgian port and across the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the English port of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> to mark the worst peacetime disaster involving a British ship since the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. About 270 set out from <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> and stopped just outside the harbor wall where the ferry capsized March 6, 1987, when water rushed in through its open bow doors five minutes after it left port. For 20 minutes they cast flowers onto the choppy seas from the Baltic Ferry, which the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s owners P and O pressed into service for the sad pilgrimage. Some were led away to be comforted by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and social workers. Others clung to their families. A few went off by themselves and stood looking into the murky waters. On the upper car deck, which was transformed into a makeshift chapel bedecked with flowers, prayers were said by three clergymen _ an Anglican, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and a major from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ during a half-hour service. `` This service can mark a new beginning,'' said The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, vicar of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. `` It does not mean we forget those who we have loved. ... In fact, it is from that memory that we build a new future.'' His words were echoed by The Bishop of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, The Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Third </PERSON>, who told more than 600 bereaved at the Anglican church of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> that it was time to leave their grief behind. `` It is right to grieve. It is health-giving to express your sorrow _ but you ca n't go on doing it for a lifetime. There must come a moment when you surrender your grief, when you stop crying.'' At St. Donaas Roman Catholic church across the road from <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> port, the Sunday service was turned into a memorial for the ferry victims. The Rev. <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Catry </PERSON> also offered prayers that the survivors and bereaved would be able to reconstruct their lives. He said in his sermon that a rose garden and plaque would be unveiled in May in front of the church to commemorate the dead. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who turned his body into a human bridge so 20 passengers including his wife and daughter could walk across his back to safety, paid his own private tribute. He went out on a Belgian tug to the spot where the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> capsized and with his 13-year-old daughter <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> dropped 193 flowers into the water, one by one. His wife, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, like several other Britons who came here, remained onshore, unable at the last minute to relive their nightmares. Said Mrs. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>: `` I hate this day _ I just wish I could take it off the calendar.''

 An overwrought hockey fan was arrested after he tossed a live chicken in a purple uniform onto the ice during a game, police said. `` The chicken was the victim of fowl play,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON> quipped Sunday. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodenfels </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, was booked for investigation of malicious mischief and cruelty to animals Saturday night and released on his own recognizance Sunday, <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON> said. The chicken hit the ice just before the end of the first period of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>' game with the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadiens </ORGANIZATION>. `` Apparently he was n't happy with how the Kings were playing, which is understandable,'' <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON> said. Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodenfels </PERSON> smuggled the bird into the Forum inside a sack. He said the man was n't arrested before the chicken hit the ice because `` there's no violation for carrying a chicken around.'' The purple-uniformed Kings fell to the <ORGANIZATION> Canadiens </ORGANIZATION> 7-6 in overtime, their 39th loss of the season. The bird, which suffered minor bruises, was being held by county animal control officers, <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON> said. `` The guy actually called us this morning and asked us to release his chicken to him,'' <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Of course, we declined because the bird is evidence.''

 U.N.-sponsored <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks resumed today with uncertainty persisting over whether <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is ready to sign an agreement with the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government which it does not recognize. Resumption of talks came after unprecedented consultations between the Pakistani government and opposition leaders attended by <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>. Sources close to the meetings held during the weekend in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said most of 19 opposition parties urged the government not to stand in the way of the proposed pullout of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops helping <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to fight Moslem insurgents. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said a withdrawal could start in mid-May if a settlement is signed by next week. In an interview published today, Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said his country will not budge from its demand for an interim government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as part of a settlement. The Gulf News daily reported that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was optimistic that the proposed peace accord on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be signed on schedule. `` There is no question of the accord not going through. Allowing it to be dropped is no option,'' he was quoted as saying. Upon his return to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Sunday night, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said the formation of a broad-based transitional government was as important as the troop withdrawl in bringing peace to the region. `` Why should we not insist on an interim government,'' he said in response to a question from a reporter at the airport. Last week <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would make up its mind after the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> consultations on whether to sign a settlement with the present <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, which <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does not recognize. He put up only a cryptic smile when asked again before today's session if <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> was now prepared to sign <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has insisted that any agreement on the withdrawal Soviet troops should be linked to formation of an interim government that is acceptable to all sides in the 9-year-old war. The <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> government says this is the only way to ensure the safe repatriation of 5 million Afghan refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has been representing Afghan rebels at the U.N.-sponsored talks, which began in 1982. The resistance movements, which say they represent 200,000 guerrillas, have rejected any power-sharing with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and have presented a plan of their own for an Islamic government The Afghan government says its own policy of national reconciliation envisages a `` coalition government'' open to all political forces including the Pakistan-based resistance movements. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which sent its troops in December 1979 to help a faltering Marxist government suppress a Moslem insurrection, no longer demands a transitional government be formed before withdrawal. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary general who has been mediating the Afghan talks, said last week all major differences had been resolved in the first three days of the new negotiating round, which began last Wednesday. The two sides agreed on a nine-month timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said this agreement, following years of stalling on the timetable issue, represented a `` significant step'' toward a final political settlement. The sides also agreed that half of the Soviet troops would leave in the first three-month phase, the so-called `` front-end loading'' which had been a major concern of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

The agency said schools and hospitals were hit in the wave of Iraqi raids on the southern city of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION> and Dezful, <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khorramabad </LOCATION> and other population centers in the west. Eight other people were wounded in missile strikes on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Sunday, it said.

 A special education student says no other youths moved to help her when two boys raped her in a classroom, and when the bell rang at the end of the period they left laughing. The Magee resident also said two boys charged with the rape at <ORGANIZATION> Magee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> had harassed her for about two years. `` Me and -LRB- he -RRB- fight every day,'' the 16-year-old girl said in a weekend interview with The Clarion Ledger at her parents' rural <LOCATION> Simpson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> home. `` He just picks on me and call my mom and daddy names.'' The girl said she was raped by two male students on Feb. 26 while she and other students were in study hall under the supervision of teacher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>, who said he had gone to check on a school bus he drives when the attack occurred. The girl, who has a learning disability, and her family agreed to discuss the attack if their identities were n't disclosed, the newspaper said Sunday. The girl said the youths, ages 15 and 17, grabbed her around the neck when she and another girl went to sharpen their pencils. They grabbed the other girl, too, but let her go, she said. `` They carried me in the back of the room. I told them to leave me alone.'' The girl said the youths pulled off her underwear, and each raped her twice, she said. `` One was holding me,'' she said. `` Every time I tried to get up, they hold me down.'' The attack occurred within sight of several other students, she said. All the students in the study hall, except for one of the attackers, were regular students, said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairwoman. One of the boys is educably mentally retarded, according to special education director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>. No one stopped the attack, the girl said, even though she told the other girl at the pencil sharpener to alert a principal or teacher. `` When the bell rang, they walked out the door, laughing,'' she said. The girl's father said he is as upset with school officials as he is the two boys. `` I send them to learn, not to be going down there to get raped,'' he said. The father said he called police and took his daughter to <ORGANIZATION> Magee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> that night to be examined. The two youths were arrested Thursday, charged with rape and jailed in lieu of $ 50,000 bond each. Although they will be tried as adults, officials refused to release their names. <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said school officials are planning counseling for the girl.

 Arab guerrillas in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hijacked a passenger bus today and held it for three hours before <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops stormed it, killing three gunmen. Three Israeli civilians also were killed and eight were wounded, an army communique said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run radio said the terrorists infiltrated from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and were armed with fragmentation grenades, assault rifles and a submachine gun. A man claiming to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 17 phoned a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and claimed responsibility for the hijacking. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> news the group was not responsible for the attack. But a survivor from the bus said she heard the Arab gunmen say they were from <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction headed by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. A special anti-terrorist unit and border police stormed the bus, which was loaded with nuclear plant workers and hijacked near the Aroer junction eight miles from the Dimona nuclear facility. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> linked the attack to the rioting in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` These are the same people who incite violence in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories. We shall not tire from fighting them,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. He noted today's attack was the second infiltration in two days. Three Palestinian guerrillas were killed by army soldiers on Sunday after they tried to cross the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and officials said the terrorists came across the lightly guarded border from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> at night near <LOCATION> Ramat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nafha </LOCATION> and commandeered an Israeli military automobile at about 7 a.m. The Arab guerrillas drove the Renault-4 towards the <LOCATION> Beersheva-Dimona </LOCATION> highway, throwing a hand grenade at an Israeli semi-trailer but causing no injuries. The army and witnesses said a <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> bus with the nuclear workers was coming from the opposite direction, and the gunmen fired at the bus and threw grenades until it stopped. Most of the passengers and the driver escaped but a man and nine women remained, the radio said. The last bus hijacking inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occurred on April 12, 1984, when four bomb-weilding Palestinians hijacked an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus near the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>. A soldier was killed on the bus when Israeli troops stormed the vehicle and captured the hijackers. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Soroka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beersheva </LOCATION> said eight women were admitted for treatment of gunshot wounds. Police forced the bus to stop after the terrorists fired from the bus at passing people and cars. Police closed the area, and army officers entered into negotiations with terrorists. The Arab gunmen demanded to speak with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and also asked for a loudspeaker. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s southern region, decided to storm the bus rather than negotiate further after the gunmen opened fire. `` We made every effort to both relax them and to promise them that negotiations may bring results,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> told reporters at the scene. `` -LRB- But -RRB- they fired at us twice and afterwards they fired and killed one of the hostages and fired at women who were inside the bus,'' he said. In all, he said, the storming operation lasted about a minute. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said the man was killed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> gunmen during negotiations. He said shots fired by the terrorists when the bus was stormed appeared to have killed the women. The victims were not identified, apparently because of the sensitivity of their jobs. At the hospital, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a curly-haired man in his late 20s, said he saw armed terrorists block the blue <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> bus, a special commuter vehicle carrying women workers from a plant in <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION>. `` The terrorists blocked the bus and did n't give the driver a chance to turn around and get away,'' he said. `` The driver opened the door and many of the passengers scrambled out. About a half-dozen remained on the bus.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said the bus hijacking began about 7:30 a.m. and he watched the hijacking from another bus. He declined to give his last name. <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayon </PERSON>, a motorist traveling the <LOCATION> Beersheva-Dimona </LOCATION> highway, said the Arab gunmen armed with Soviet-made automatic rifles shot at his car when he refused to stop for them. `` I saw only two Kalashnikovs in front of my eyes,'' he said in an interview broadcast by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. It was the bloodiest attack by Palestinian guerrillas since a hang-glider attack in late November in which a guerrilla landed in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and shot to death six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and wounded eight. The Dimona plant is at the center of a secret trial now going on in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, a former nuclear technician at Dimona, revealed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s atomic secrets to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> in an expose published Oct. 5, 1986. Based on <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s information, the newspaper concluded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> possessed the world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal. In the Sunday Times story, <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> detailed the route taken by 40 blue and white <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> buses he said transported workers to the nuclear plant each day. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, 33, was tried on charges of treason and espionage for revealing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear capability and the three-judge panel in the closed-door trial is currently deliberating its verdict.

 A 15-year-old boy described as despondent over school problems and upset about the outcome of a college basketball game blasted away with an assortment of rifles and handguns for five hours inside his home, officials said today. No one was injured in the incident, which ended when deputies talked the boy into surrendering early today, said <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. `` The house is a shambles,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said this morning. `` He shot out the television, the stove, the walls and ceilings, windows, sliding glass doors, a water pipe which ruptured and squirted water everywhere, and even the electrical box in the basement.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, had picked up a gun and started shooting Sunday night. His mother ran next door to call police.

<HEAD>Court Will Try Again to Decide on Suing Cities in Ohio Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today it will try again to decide whether cities may be sued successfully when citizens' rights are violated due to alleged inadequate training of municipal employees The justices said they will study the issue in an appeal by <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, officials. The city is seeking to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police violated her rights by failing to provide her medical attention after she was arrested for speeding. The justices last year backed out of deciding the municipal-liability issue in a case from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. By a 5-4 vote, the court declined for procedural reasons to decide whether <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> should be forced to pay damages in the death of a fleeing motorist killed by a policeman's bullet. The ruling left intact a $ 50,000 damage award the city was ordered to pay to the victim's family. The case acted on today involves <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who was granted a retrial of her lawsuit by a lower court. <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> officials said alleged inadequate training of police in summoning medical help should not be the basis for a lawsuit against the city. Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' lawsuit grows out of an April 26, 1978, incident in which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teen-age daughter to school. Police said they put Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> into a patrol wagon after the 52-year-old woman became upset and uncooperative. On arrival at the police station, the officers said she was lying on the floor of the vehicle. She repeatedly slumped to the floor during a stay of 30 to 40 minutes at the stationhouse. Police officers did not call for medical help. They said they believed Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was merely excited and would calm down if left alone and permitted to see her family. When family members arrived, they had Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> taken by ambulance to a hospital where she was diagnosed as suffering from stress reaction, anxiety and depression. The symptoms included immobility and difficulty in breathing. She was under psychiatric care for more than a year later. The <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> family sued the city in federal court, and a jury awarded $ 200,000 against the city on grounds Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> unreasonably was denied medical attention. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw out the verdict last July, saying it was unclear on what theory the damage award was based. The judge's instructions to the jury could have allowed it to decide erroneously that the city was at fault even if the failure to summon medical attention was not the result of a city policy, the appeals court said. `` This instruction allows a finding of municipal liability merely because -LRB- the city's -RRB- supervisory personnel did a bad act, with no need to find that the city was a bad actor through a city policy or custom. This was error,'' the appeals court said. <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> officials asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to throw out the lawsuit. City officials said the 6th Circuit court ruling will allow the city to be found liable for misconduct at the retrial under an unreasonably broad theory. The city may be forced to pay damages if the jury decides that police were not trained adequately to summon medical help in such cases, city officials said. The appeals court ruling will impose `` the novel requirement upon cities that their police forces must provide paramedical officers or other trained medical specialists who exercise some type of professional judgment at the jail,'' city officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently has had trouble providing clear guidelines on the issue of inadequate police training as grounds for municipal liability in federal civil rights suits. In a 7-1 ruling in 1985 the justices threw out a $ 1.5 million award against <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the shooting death of a tavern patron by a police officer. Only four justices agreed it was a mistake for the jury to be told it could infer from a single incident that the city was grossly negligent in its police training. Three other justices voted to throw out the award for other reasons. The case is <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 86-1088.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters dodged heavy machine-gun fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today claimed responsibility for the attack which came after the helicopters ignored a warning to stay clear of an `` Iranian zone.'' The account carried by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> evidently referred to the incident Saturday night reported earlier by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. They said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> helicopters took `` evasive action'' when fired on from an oil platform and several small boats in the central gulf about midnight Saturday. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there was no connection between the helicopter incident and the movement of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships up the gulf today. The ships' appearance off <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> triggered speculation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was planning to retaliate for the shooting Saturday. All six, including a missile cruiser, three missile frigates, a combat stores ship and a chartered <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tanker, were part of `` routine movement, not connected with any other recent events in the gulf,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command. Saturday's helicopter incident occurred as the aircraft were scouting ahead of the missile frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, returning up the gulf after a convoy escort mission. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said the helicopters took evasive action and did not return fire when the Iranians shot at them. It did not say what kind of helicopters were involved or how many there were. Nor did the statement mention any warning by the Iranians before they started shooting. The platform was not identified by name or exact location, although the statement said it was not the <PERSON> Rostam </PERSON> platform. <PERSON> Rostam </PERSON> was shelled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyers last October in a retaliatory raid after an Iranian Silkworm missile hit a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flagged Kuwaiti tanker, the <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, anchored off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The Iranian account said: `` Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters attempting to approach an Iranian zone in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> early Sunday were forced to flee by the anti-aircraft fire of naval forces of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' It added: `` The navy anti-aircraft -LRB- unit -RRB- detected the two helicopters on its radar and warned them to stay out of the Iranian zone. However, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> navy fired warning shots after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters violated the Iranian zone.'' Shortly after midnight Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> fired at what were believed to be Iranian speedboats seen on the radar screen before they disappeared. Also Sunday, thousands of Iranians marched through central <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, claiming <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had supplied <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with long-range missiles, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said a number of students entered the embassy grounds by scaling a wall, but were thrown out by `` alert policemen.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it first learned about <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s new missiles seven months ago and had warned the Soviets that any use of the rockets would harm relations between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a mob besieged the embassy, pelted it with rocks and tried to set fires, threatening the lives of Soviet diplomats and their families. Similar `` hostile actions'' were directed Sunday at the Soviet Consulate in <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet leadership `` rejects any allegations about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s involvement in the missile attacks against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>.'' In the so-called `` war of the cities,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 12 civilians, including women and children, were killed and 30 wounded when an Iraqi missile exploded in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today. It said a clinic, several houses and 30 vehicles were destroyed in the blast. The missile was one of two <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its army lobbed into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> early today. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said another 61 civilians were killed and 427 wounded Sunday in Iraqi air raids on 16 Iranian cities and towns. It reported that Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired a missile at a `` military center'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> around midnight. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the missile exploded in a residential area of the capital, killing and wounding `` a number of civilians, including women and children.''

<HEAD>Air Ambulance Firm Accused Of Federal Rule Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> company that provides helicopters and crews for a third of the nation's civilian air ambulance services has been accused of violating federal aviation regulations, probably unintentionally, a newspaper reports. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged violations involved paperwork and record-keeping deficiencies, The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> findings stem from a two-month investigation of the company's safety procedures and regulation compliance, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, which covers <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, The alleged violations are being reviewed and the final number could be fewer than the 120 now pending, <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> said. `` It looks like a case where a small company based in one location grew very rapidly to the point where it had aircraft and people operating in dozens of states and no real handle on how to manage them,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Rocky Mountain Helicopter, the industry's largest vendor, supplies aircraft, pilots and mechanics to hospitals in 39 cities, including <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> said Rocky Mountain Helicopters faces possible fines because the investigation uncovered a number of significant problems. However, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> believes <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> is now operating in compliance with regulations and the agency had no plans to lift their license to fly. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Spray </PERSON>, the company's vice president of emergency medical services operations, said, `` We do n't deny we made some mistakes, but we're fixing them as fast as they're being pointed out.'' The inspection was spawned by congressional pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> last year after a record medical helicopter accident rate in 1986, but the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it also wanted to become more acquainted with the medical helicopter industry. There are more than 235 medical helicopter programs operating at least 500 helicopters in 46 states. `` What we learn from <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> will help us to manage the whole industry better,'' <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s 143-page report referred to such shortcomings as a lack of documented training in evacuating patients from the aircraft in emergencies, The Press reported. Other alleged violations ranged from a lack of training for the company's pilots to the failure of the director of operations and chief pilot to have the proper <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> licenses for those positions, the newspaper said. On Feb. 12, Rocky Mountain voluntarily grounded 62 of its helicopters until mechanics in each city could confirm all maintenance and accompanying paperwork were up-to-date and accurate. `` In most cases, this -LRB- grounding -RRB- just took long enough for a phone call to each city, but three aircraft were grounded for a day or so for repairs,'' Spray said. On Feb. 17, <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> grounded 24 of its pilots because they did not have the proper paperwork to show they had received required training. `` Within two days, all the pilots were flying legal again,'' Spray said.

 A Roman Catholic bishops' conference gave the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> information on an abortion rights group that planned peaceful demonstrations during Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a newspaper reports. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based Catholics for a Free Choice, said she was surprised by the action. The information on the group was provided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of the papal visit, which is the religious arm of the civil <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` I think it is totally inappropriate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to be cooperating with government agencies in the collection of data that they know has no relevance to the physical safety of the pope,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON> said. `` There has been within the church anincreasing attempt to silence and punish individuals who exercise their rights to disagree with the bishops on public policy,'' she added. `` I think that represents a kind of McCarthyism in the church.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON> said there is no evidence the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> conducted surveillance on her organization. The Chronicle reported Sunday it was unclear how or if the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which was in charge of the pope's security during the Sept. 10-19 trip, used the information about Ms. <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON>'s group <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doerflinger </PERSON>, assistant director of the bishops' Office for Pro-life Activities, said his 1985 report about Catholics for a Free Choice was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> along with several membership letters and press releases on <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> letterhead that he had obtained. <PERSON> Doerflinger </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` wanted to be sent any materials about groups conducting protests so they would know what to expect.''

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for King's Libel Lawsuit Against Boston Globe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today cleared the way for a jury trial in former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King's $ 3.6 million libel lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a jury should hear <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column written by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, who since has left the newspaper. The state court ruled that a jury might conclude that one allegation in the column had been published with `` actual malice'' _ a reckless disregard for the truth. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> in November blocked a libel trial, and the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later refused to set aside <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s order Today's action set aside <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s trial-blocking order. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review. King sued over various Globe articles and editorial cartoons published in 1981. The state court threw out most of the ex-governor's claims in pretrial proceedings, but said a jury trial was needed regarding the <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> column. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> were named as defendants. In it, <PERSON> King </PERSON> was criticized for treating legislative and judicial figures as if they were his employees. `` That condescending attitude never was more evident than in October when King called a judge and demanded that he change a decision he rendered in a gang-rape case,'' the column said. In a much-publicized case, the judge had given a suspended prison sentence to five men who pleaded guilty to rape. King's lawsuit said no such conversation between King and the judge took place. State Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, a King political ally, said in pretrial testimony that he was <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>'s source about <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s telephone call to the judge But the state's highest court noted that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> was not told that <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> had overheard the conversation, and that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> did not investigate further. The court said a jury conceivably could conclude that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>'s failure to do so amounted to actual malice Public figures who sue for libel must prove that the allegedly libelous statement is false and was made with actual malice. Private citizens have a less stringent burden, and must prove only that the statement is false and was made negligently. In a pretrial deposition, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said he had no reason to doubt <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>'s `` veracity and accuracy.'' In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> court ruling `` mutates actual malice into negligence, thus eviscerating'' the free-speech protections the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has built into libel law since 1964. `` As long as writers are exposed to liability solely for the asserted inadequacies of their investigations, speech protected under the Constitution will be chilled,'' the newspaper's lawyers said. `` Stories for which reliable sources exist may be self-censored out of existence.'' But lawyers for King urged the court to reject the appeal and allow a jury trial on the libel allegation. `` <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> had obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>'s report,'' they said The newspaper's appeal was supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> and other news organizations. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. King, 87-731.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> man convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978. The court is expected to use the case to study death row inmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal courts for help and to decide whether <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> juries may be told their life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trial judge's approval. <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who once worked as a corrections officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, was convicted of the Jan. 23, 1978, strangulation of <PERSON> Trisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornley </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>. His conviction and death sentence have been upheld three times by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The nation's highest court refused to review his case twice. In the second federal court appeal, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in early 1986 challenged statements made to the jury by the judge in his state court sentencing trial. Under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, a jury recommends life or death for convicted murderers in capital cases. The presiding judge is free to follow or disregard the recommendation. In <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' case, the judge told jurors about that aspect of the state's capital-sentencing law. `` The final decision as to what punishment shall be imposed rests solely upon the judge of this court,'' the jury was told. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> argued that such jury instructions run afoul of a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in which the justices, ruling in a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> case, said a death sentence is invalid if a jury is misled about its role in determining whether the defendant actually will die. In the case, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> prosecutor had told jurors they should not view themselves as determining life or death because their sentence would be reviewed automatically by an appeals court. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said such a statement misled the jury, and rendered the subsequent death sentence `` cruel and unusual punishment.'' A federal judge dismissed <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' 1986 appeal but the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Nov. 13 threw out his sentence. The appeals court said the judge's instructions to jurors violated the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 decision, adding that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was entitled to `` a new sentencing proceeding before an untainted jury.'' In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prosecutors noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> previously had rejected an appeal in which <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> mounted an identical challenge to the judge's instructions to jurors. They asked the justices to resolve the conflict between the state's highest court and the 11th Circuit court. The state's appeal also contended that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' challenge should not have been allowed because he did not raise it in his first federal court appeal. The case is <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 87-121.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to free churches from having to comply with state financial-disclosure laws when waging public referendum campaigns. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and freedom of speech. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> law also affects other non-political organizations that decided to campaign for or against issues that appear on election ballots. The controversy arose during an August 1984 election held in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> to determine whether establishments within the city would be allowed to sell liquor by the drink. The local option referendum was defeated by a vote of 6,514 to 6,474 _ a 40-vote margin. The 13 area churches, nine of them Baptist-affiliated, took varying steps to make public their opposition to allowing on-premise liquor consumption in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. The churches spent a total of $ 5,150, mostly for advertising, in opposition to the referendum. But they failed to register as `` political campaign committees'' as required by the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Campaign Financial Disclosure Act of 1980. The law defines such committees as any combination of two or more people `` making expenditures to support or oppose any candidate for public office or measure.'' It requires that the committees designate a political treasurer and file campaign-disclosure statements. The churches sued the state to challenge the law as applied to them. At trial, pastors for the churches testified that the referendum opposition resulted from moral, not political, concerns and that they considered their actions to be part of the churches' religious mission. The pastors also testified that their churches had not, and would not, get involved in partisan political campaigns as a matter of religious conviction. A state trial judge ruled against the churches, finding that all of them are `` political campaign committees'' as defined by the 1980 state law and that the law is constitutional. A state appeals court later overturned the state law as a violation of constitutional free-speech rights. The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last May 26 ruled that the law does not violate free-speech rights when applied to either partisan elections featuring candidates or non-partisan referendum elections. `` The recent history of campaign financial abuses as well as the growth and possible dominance of special interest political action committees make the state's disclosure requirements necessary to allow the public to have some gauge by which to assess the sources, content and frequency of campaign publicity and activity,'' the state court ruled. Its ruling did not discuss the churches' argument that the law violates their right to exercise freely their religious beliefs. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the 13 churches noted that the justices have `` never passed on the validity of disclosure requirements in referendum campaigns.'' The appeal questioned whether any state may justify `` prior registration and disclosure requirements to non-political organizations in general and churches in particular.'' Tennessee Attorney General W.J. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> urged the high court to reject the churches' appeal. `` The fact that this is a referendum election does not make the state's interest in providing any information to the voters as to how the election is financed any less compelling,'' <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> said. The 13 churches who challenged the law are <ORGANIZATION> Bemis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> Baptist, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bemis </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION>, Malesus Baptist, <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Baptist </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Poplar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Skyline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Criminal Trials in Louisiana Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that the public has no right to attend hearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal trial jury while the trial is underway. The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess the validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986 racketeering trial of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. A federal appeals court, in upholding the closed hearings, ruled that the public's constitutional right to attend criminal trials does not extend to `` the midtrial questioning of jurors.'' The appeals court also ruled that transcripts of the closed hearings may be withheld from public disclosure during the trial even if the jury is sequestered, and that the names of the jurors involved may be erased from the transcripts. After a 1985 trial ended in mistrial because a federal jury could not reach a unanimous verdict, then-Gov. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and four co-defendants stood trial again in 1986 on charges of racketeering and bribery. All were acquitted after a two-month trial. On two occasions during the second trial, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Livaudais </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> received reports that the sequestered jury had been tainted. The first report suggested that one juror had told another that jury members in <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' first trial were paid to vote for acquittal. The second report suggested one juror had told another of a possible bribery attempt by one defendant. In both instances, <PERSON> Livaudais </PERSON> conducted proceedings in his chambers and determined that the people involved could continue serving as jurors. Courtroom spectators, including news reporters, were given only vague accounts of why the hearings were held. The judge said he would release partial transcripts sometime after the trial was completed, but that those transcripts would not include juror names. Three news organizations _ The <ORGANIZATION> Times-Picayune </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> _ and several of their reporters challenged the judge's use of closed hearings. The Times-Picayune is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> publishes the Morning Advocate and State-Times newspapers in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. The challenge contended that <PERSON> Livaudais </PERSON> should have given the reporters a chance to argue in favor of conducting open-court hearings and that he was required to tell why it was necessary to conduct the hearings in secret. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last July 31 upheld the closed hearings. The appeals court noted that past <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings have established a public right of access to criminal trials but ruled that under that constitutional right `` no presumption of openness attaches to proceedings involving midtrial questioning of jurors.'' `` If the questioning of impaneled jurors were held in open court there is a substantial probability that what may have begun as a ` tempest in a teapot' will end in a mistrial, a hung jury or a reversal on appeal,'' the 5th Circuit court said. The news organizations then sought <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Times-Picayune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 87-872.

 Communist rebels ambushed and killed six Filipino sailors assigned to <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> base 10 miles from the U.S.-run installation, the military said today. Three civilians also died in the shootout. Philippine officials today urged President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to develop a unified negotiating strategy before talks on the future of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. One of the country's best-known rebel priests fled to <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island after he was wounded by comrades who learned he was planning to surrender, officials said today. The Philippine Constabulary said the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> sailors were traveling to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Sunday when rebels opened fire on their land rover near the town of <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> peninsula. Three civilians were killed in the cross fire during the 15-minute battle, the military said. There were no reports of rebel casualties. <PERSON> Subic </PERSON>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, is one of six installations technically under Philippine command but effectively under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control. Communist rebels operate near both Subic and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. In October last year, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extraction in coordinated attacks outside <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Cabinet secretaries and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told reporters after a two-hour meeting today with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> that they would continue talks to firm up the government position on U.S.-run bases. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are expected to begin talks in the next few weeks on the future of the U.S.-run installations. Under the current agreement, either government can unilaterally close the bases if it serves one-year's notice after Sept. 16, 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says she will honor the current bases treaty but has refused to say whether she will agree to extend the agreement. Any extension beyond 1991 requires approval by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON> said matters to be discussed in the review include the future of Filipino employees at the bases and the possibility that nuclear weapons are being stored at the facilities. She said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is `` leaving us the liberty of taking a stand. On the other hand there is a need to coordinate the positions of the executive and the legislative.'' <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Capangpangan </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, said the rebel priest, Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, sent word that he was recuperating in a <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> area hideout and wanted to surrender and be granted amnesty. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> has been identified by the military as a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commander in eastern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Capangpangan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was apparently suffering from a bullet wound in the shoulder which he received in an ambush by his own followers last week in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Surigao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Charges Against 36 Arrested Outside
White House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reinstate charges against 36 people arrested outside the White House while protesting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration domestic and foreign policies. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that dismissed the charges on grounds government prosecutors acted vindictively. A demonstration for `` peace, jobs and justice'' occurred April 22, 1985. About 200 participants were arrested. They were charged with violating the terms of their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police march permit by sitting down on sidewalks outside the White House. Most of those arrested agreed to pay a $ 50 fine for demonstrating without a permit rather than stand trial. But 36 demonstrators chose to stand trial. They were charged _ in addition to demonstrating without a permit _ with obstructing the sidewalks adjacent to the White House. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a $ 500 fine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> ordered all charges against the 36 dismissed, ruling that prosecutors acted vindictively by bringing the second charge only for those who chose to stand trial. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s decision last year. The appeals court said there was ample evidence for <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to conclude that prosecutors added the second charge to punish demonstrators for choosing to stand trial. `` A large group of defendants threatened to go to trial on what the government considered petty offenses,'' the appeals court said. `` The government had a strong incentive to try to keep clear of this courtroom morass. It wished to avoid the annoyance and expense of prosecuting these minor cases at a potentially drawn-out trial.'' Prosecutors showed a `` disturbing willingness to toy with the defendants,'' the appeals court added. It said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was justified in throwing out both charges against the 36 demonstrators, not merely the second accusation that they obstructed the sidewalks. `` If in cases of vindictive prosecution the trial court judge may only dismiss the additional charge, the prosecutor wil have nothing to lose by acting vindictively,'' the appeals court said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the lower court rulings could `` significantly hamper'' the government's handling off mass demonstrations in the nation's capital. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, 87-730.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for Trial in California Rent-Control Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today cleared the way for a trial in what may become an important test case on the power of cities to control rents and otherwise protect mobile home residents. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by the owners of a mobile home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of their property's full value. A <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> ordinance adopted in 1984 requires mobile home park operators to offer their tenants leases of unlimited duration. It also permits a maximum yearly rent increase of 3 percent or three-fourths of the increase in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is greater. The ordinance was challenged by <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who own the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amigos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. They said their property is being `` taken'' without the `` just compensation'' required by the Constitution. The Halls argued that granting mobile home owners a perpetual lease allows them to sell the lease at a windfall profit. The windfall is due to the new owners' anticipation of continued low land rent at below-market rates, the Halls said. A federal judge threw out the suit, but the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated it in 1986. The appeals court noted that the Halls said the price of mobile homes in the park shot up dramatically after the ordinance was enacted, suggesting the guaranteed low rents were worth a premium to buyers. `` Reduced to its essentials,'' the appeals court said, the Halls' claim `` is that the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> ordinance has transferred a possessory interest in their land to each of their 71 tenants. This interest consists of the right to occupy the property in perpetuity while paying only a fraction of what it is worth in rent.'' The appeals court acknowledged that the ordinance allows mobile home owners to be removed if they do n't pay the rent or if they misbehave. That may ease the economic impact, the appeals court said, but it does not alter the basic right of possession given the home owners. The ordinance `` changes the fundamental relationship between the parties, giving landlord and tenant complementary estates in the same land,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court said a trial is necessary to determine if the Halls' allegations about a windfall are accurate. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and other cities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> joined in asking the high court to review the case. The cities are <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Capitola </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Altos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxnard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirage </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buenaventura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. The justices on Feb. 24 expanded the power of communities to impose rent controls by upholding a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, ordinance that allows hardships to tenants to be considered when landlords seek rent increases. The ordinance had been atttacked as a `` Robin Hood'' law that steals from the rich to pay the poor. The case is <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> vs. Hall, 87-220.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal of Jehovah's Witness in Florida Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear the appeal of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman who says she was denied custody of her young child because she is a <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witness. The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings that bar <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> from exposing her daughter to any of her religious beliefs. The state courts also awarded primary residential custody of the girl to her father. In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> said her freedom-of-religion rights were violated by the custody determination. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> were divorced in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1985, after a four-year marriage. Their daughter, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, was then 3. Marital difficulties arose in 1983 over Mrs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>'s involvement with the <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses religion Her husband is a Catholic who, according to court documents, felt his wife had `` betrayed him'' by joining the <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses. At a custody trial, <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> testfieid that it was not in <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>'s best interest to be raised as a <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witness. Of the 485 pages in the divorce proceedings transcript devoted to child custody, 249 pages contain references to the subject of religion. Two psychologists and one psychiatrist testified that <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> should live with her mother, whom they called the child's `` prime parent figure.'' But the experts said contact with her mother's <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witness religion was not in <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>'s best interest because she needs `` to adapt herself to the mainstream of culture.'' They testified that a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> upbringing `` would allow her to adapt to society and have the freedom that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children have in the society.'' Judge <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, in awarding primary custody of <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> to her father, ruled that Mrs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> should enjoy `` regular, frequent and liberal visitation, access and contact with the minor child.'' But he also barred Mrs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> from exposing <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> to `` any religious practices, attendances, teachings or events which are in any way inconsistent with the religious teachings and practices of the Catholic religion.'' A state appeals court upheld the custody award, ruling that `` the record in this case does not support -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>'s -RRB- contention that the trial court made the father the primary residential parent ... solely because the mother is a practicing <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witness.'' In a dissenting vote, one appeals court judge said granting the father primary custody amounted to `` an abuse of discretion.'' `` The child, exposed to the religious views of both parents for two years, showed no evidence of emotional or psychological harm,'' the judge said, adding that the custody proceedings showed `` the experts' personal biases against the mother's religion.'' `` Their disdain for the mother's religion induced them to speculate as to the possibility of harm to the child in the future even though no evidence of harm existed,'' the dissenting judge said. Lawyers for Mrs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> told the justices, `` This court can not eliminate religious bigotry in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but it can and should review this decision, which has deprived a parent of her child because of intolerance of her faith.'' The appeal added, `` The trial court's order places <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> in the anomalous position of having a constitutionally protected right to speak to total strangers about her religion but not to her own child.'' The case is <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, 87-1166.

 A co-worker and a relative of an American kidnapped in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last week by <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> rebels say they have been told he is safe, but add that they do n't trust the Contras. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Elkin </PERSON>, was among 12 people abducted Tuesday from the village of <LOCATION> Mancotal </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The main thing that my family wants is for him to be released,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>'s sister, who lives in <LOCATION> Carrboro </LOCATION>. Contras, who oppose <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, claim the group was `` detained,'' not kidnapped. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, 30, is a long-term volunteer with Witness for Peace, a U.S.-based grass-roots ecumenical group that works in the war zones of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> trying to change <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the country. He has been in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since November, assigned to travel from town to town along the Honduran border recording witnesses' stories of Contra attacks. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marker </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of Witness For Peace, said Contras kicked down the door of a house in which <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> was staying and began shooting, wounding a 13-year-old girl in the leg. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> was taken prisoner at gunpoint while trying to bandage the girl's wound, <PERSON> Marker </PERSON> said. Six of the abductees have escaped since Tuesday, he said, and one has told Witness For Peace specifics of the incident. `` The Contras still have <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, and he obviously ca n't go until they let him go,'' <PERSON> Marker </PERSON> said. `` I believe if they wanted to, they could release him immediately.'' `` We're not one bit happy that they're holding him, and we do n't trust them, quite frankly,'' <PERSON> Marker </PERSON> said Marker said a Contra leader confirmed Friday only that they had <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and that he was safe. Ms. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who said she did n't learn of the abduction until Thursday night, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials told her Saturday that her brother was all right.

<TEXT>
 There were differences in culture and style in a television linkup between Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students and scholars, but the students and 10 panelists agreed that the two countries are making progress in breaking down barriers. The two-hour forum Saturday joined 350 undergraduates at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s downtown campus with 200 <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students. Not accustomed to the American style of TV answers, the Soviets often strayed from the questioning and read prepared speeches detailing minor points in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear history. At one juncture, Soviet moderator <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> said, `` It's a lecture. We have to teach the students something here.'' <PERSON> Andrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, told a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> questioner the superpowers are moving past Cold War tensions to begin `` to clear off layers of mutual fears.'' `` It seems to me what we are doing now in a first step to disarmament should create a new basis, a new faith to increase trust in each other,'' <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON> said. The satellite-relayed `` space bridge'' forum was the first of three between <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> State on the nuclear arms race and Cold War politics. The sessions are part of a course devised by <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. The panel included two Americans who worked on the top-secret <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project that developed the first atomic bomb in 1945, and a Soviet researcher who helped build that country's first nuclear weapon in 1949. Students and scientists frequently interrupted each other with applause, the loudest when <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> praised Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to ease nuclear tensions. `` I think there's not a single person here who thinks he will be able to survive a nuclear bomb,'' said <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Milayev </PERSON>, a Soviet physics student. `` We are gathered here in the final analysis to think about what must be done to prevent a nuclear war.'' <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president for physics and mathematics for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, noted the forum came 40 years after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> abandoned its effort to ban nuclear weapons. `` Today we are at the first stages of a non-nuclear world,'' he said. <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> said the recent superpower arms reduction treaty signed in December `` is the first encouraging step. We believe, in a new international situation, we will succceed in resolving the question.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Anstendig </PERSON>, 21, a <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> junior history major from <LOCATION> Edgemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said afterward the forum went a long way to promoting better understanding. `` I think there was good rapport on both sides,'' he said. `` It'll promote better feelings. I think it's a good microcosm of what could happen.''

<HEAD>Government To Amend Constitution For Punjab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced plans today to amend the constitution to make it easier to extend direct federal rule in troubled state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Sikh militants have been waging a bloody campaign for independence. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON>, deputy home minister, told the governing lower house of Parliament the amendments would only apply to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. He said the amendments would allow the government to extend direct federal rule for more than the one year presently allowed by the constitution. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s state government was dismissed in May 1987 for failing to curb Sikh terrorism, and the state was placed under federal rule for six months. The duration was extended for another six months. On Sunday the federal government went a step further and dissolved the state assembly, paving the way for fresh elections. <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON> said articles of the constitution dealing with emergency rule will be amended to enable the government to impose a state of emergency on one state at a time. Under the current rules, a state of emergency can be imposed on the whole country but not on individual states. At least 391 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists. More than 1,000 people were killed last year. The minister, citing a government report on <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, said the state assembly was dissolved because of the `` interference from members of the legislative assembly in the effective and efficient working of the police.'' There were numerous reports, he said, when legislators `` not only attempted to interfere, influence and prevent the police action but also threatening police officers of dire consequences if they failed to obey their commands,'' <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON> said. He claimed the imposition of direct federal rule had brought about a `` distinct'' improvement in the situation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The formal bill proposing the amendments is likely to come at the end of the month. It is expected to pass easily since the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has a majority in the lower house.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Jury Award to Paralyzed Idaho Boy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a $ 1.13 million jury award to an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> boy paralyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination for three diseases. The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the vaccine manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to abandon the production of essential vaccines. <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the vaccine, said the case is a test of how far juries should be allowed to go in compensating people who suffer injuries after taking vaccines designed to protect them from life-threatening deiseases. At stake are billions of dollars because of the `` unprecedented explosion of vaccine liability litigation,'' said lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> manufactures Tri-Immunol, a vaccine to immunize children against diptheria, tetanus and pertussis The company noted that the vaccine is licensed by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and that only one other company markets a similar vaccine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Toner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was given the vaccine in 1979 when he was three months old. He subsequently contracted a rare condition of the spine known as transverse myelitis, which permanently paralyzed him from the waist down. A federal jury found that <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION>'s vaccine caused the boy's paralysis, and decided that the drug company was negligent for failing to develop an alternative vaccine that would have been safer <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> contended that the judge's instructions to the jury were indadequate because the jurors were not told that certain drugs are unavoidably unsafe and that such vaccines may be sold despite the risks. The company also said the verdict was impermissibly inconsistent with the jury's rejection of other claims against <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION>. The company said the jury, in rejecting the other claims, decided that Tri-Immunol was not defective and that there are unavoidable risks in taking the vaccine. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last September upheld the jury award. In rejecting the company's argument on inconsistency, the appeals court said, `` It is not beyond peradventure that the jury thought that Tri-Immunol was fit for the purposes for which it was to be used but that <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> was negligent in failing to replace it with a better product.'' The appeals court added, `` Were we charged with deciding whether jury verdicts are the most sensible way of allocating risks and costs regarding vaccines that have been proved beneficial, we might well design a different method.'' But it said the jury verdict did not violate <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> law, adding that any `` comprehensive reform'' in the area must be left to state legislatures. The appeals court opinion was written by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who became a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice in February. The court's brief order today did not say that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> disqualified himself from considering the appeal. His participation under the circumstances would be highly unusual. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Toner </PERSON>, 87-1151.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Allow Indian Tribe to Withhold Records in
Minnesota Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to allow an Indian tribe to withhold from federal officials confidential records of a tribal court proceeding. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that gave the government custody of court records of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chippewa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The tribe in 1985 declared that records of proceedings before its court of Indian offenses are confidential and not the federal government's property. The Chippewas were concerned that if the documents were given to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, the agency would be forced to surrender the material to a newspaper that sought the records under the Freedom of Information Act -LRB- FOIA -RRB-. Indian tribes are not covered by the <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> and may not be forced directly to reveal confidential information to the news media. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last August that the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to the material. The appeals court rejected arguments by the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Band </LOCATION> that only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could grant the government access to the records, and ruled that the government has sovereignty over tribal courts despite the absence of specific congressional authorization. The considerable independence given tribes to govern themselves does not mean they have the power automatically to withhold information from the government, the appeals court said. The Red Lake Band court of Indian offenses was established in 1884 under authority granted to the tribe by federal officials. The 8th Circuit court said that if the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> court had been created under a later federal statute, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the confidential records might be exempt from federal control. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-950.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Pennsylvania Law on Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reinstate a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law forcing state police officers to retire at age 60. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the state law violates federal restrictions against discrimination based on age. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The appeals court said it is illegal to presume that officers over 60 are physically unfit for their work when officials have failed to adopt minimum fitness standards for all workers. `` Until minimum standards are developed, implemented and enforced, the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> State Police can not justify its mandatory retirement law by relying on good health and physical conditioning as ... reasonably necessary to <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> business,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court noted that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a neighboring state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, has a mandatory retirement age of 55 for state troopers that has been upheld in the courts. But the appeals court said, `` All members of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> are subject to mandatory fitness requirements and are sanctioned for non-compliance.'' The federal law against age bias generally permits employers to force workers to retire before 70 only if it can be shown that being under 70 is a bona fide occupational qualification or if employers can prove it is highly impractical to test workers individually to assure they are still fit. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a pair of 1985 rulings that reinforced the employment rights of older workers, struck down efforts to force city firefighters to retire at age 55 and flight engineers at age 60. The 3rd Circuit court cited those cases in invalidating <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s mandatory retirement age for state police officers. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials said the appeals court ruling places a heavy financial burden on the state. The state said it could be forced to pay $ 4 million in back pay and benefits to officers who have been forced to retire. Officials also said that testing state police officers for fitness would be a costly process. They said it would cost some $ 2.4 million to determine whether the force's 4,000 members are healthy and fit. The state said its retirement-age policy is reasonable because of statistics that show a sharp decline in average fitness and health for older people. For example, the state said the decrease in aerobic capacity for an average group of men aged 26 and an average group of men age 58 is 57 percent. Relative strength declines by about 35 percent between the ages of 29 and 50 and muscular endurance slips by 30 percent between ages 30 and 60, the officials said. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s retirement law was challenged by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Binker </PERSON>, a lieutenant on the state police force who was near age 60 in 1983 when the suit was filed. The case is <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, 87-958.

<TEXT>
 The widow of former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> testified today before the special federal grand jury that is investigating the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> likely was questioned about what her husband might have told her before his death last year about the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to obtain the release of American hostages and whether he mentioned anything about the diversion of proceeds to the Contras. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who died of pneumonia on May 6, 1987, after suffering from brain cancer, was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm were sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986. The agency provided logistical support to covert operations to help the Contras. Those operations were coordinated by former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was acting with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s approval and that the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director recommended that he recruit retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to set up the private supply network because <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had experience in special operations. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who set up secret Swiss bank accounts to funnel private donations to the Contras, also helped broker the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with his partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> saw the diversion as part of an effort to create a `` stand-alone'' or `` off-the-shelf'' enterprise that could engage in covert activities outside congressional review. Mrs. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s testimony comes as the grand jury appears to be preparing to return criminal indictments against the targets of the investigation, including <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Roslyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, last fall disputed a published account by journalist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> knew about the diversion to the Contra rebels. In his book `` Veil: The Secret Wars of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said that during an interview in the hospital <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> acknowledged knowing about the diversion. In a Sept. 28, 1987, interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said her husband never told her of the diversion and expressed doubt that he knew about it. She termed `` absolute blasphemy'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>'s account that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> had criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` lazy and distracted.'' `` He's lying about that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. She described her husband as `` a team player'' and a `` great patriot who would never do anything to harm his president.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> also expressed outrage at <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>'s report that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was `` struck by the overall passivity of the president.'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> would never say that about the president,'' she said. `` Bill loved <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and they were very close.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether states may use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult bookstores. The court said it will review a pair of free-speech challenges to such an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law. Under <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, patterned after the much-used federal RICO act, law enforcement officials are authorized to seize any property used in a racketeering enterprise. The law was invoked in March 1984 against three <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> bookstores selling sexually explicit materials, each accused of at least two violations of the state's obscenity laws. Law enforcement officials padlocked the stores and seized their nventories. A short time later, similar legal action was taken against three adult bookstores in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. The three <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> bookstores were allowed to reopen in April 1985 but only one, <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, remains in business. It filed the appeal acted on today. The three <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> bookstores also have gone out of business. Later, two bookstores in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, were prosecuted under the state law. An <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> appeals court ruled in 1985 that applying the state RICO law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenity law violations impermissibly hinders constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The appeals court said the padlocking of the bookstores represented an impermissible `` prior restraint'' of materials not yet ruled obscene. The <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year reversed the appeals court, ruling that applying the <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> law in such a way is valid because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> did not pass it to promote censorship. `` The seizure order does not constitute a prior restraint or in any other manner impinge upon'' Fort Wayne Books' free-speech rights, the state court said in a 3-2 ruling. In other action, the court: _ Agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> man convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978. The court is expected to use the case to study death row inmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal courts for help and to decide whether <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> juries may be told their life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trial judge's approval. _ Left intact a $ 1.13 million jury award to an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> boy paralyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination for three diseases. The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the vaccine manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to abandon the production of essential vaccines. _ Ruled unanimously that financially troubled farmers may not avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to use their labor, experience and expertise in continuing to operate their farm. By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to `` adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law can not be satisfied by such a promise. _ Refused to free churches from having to comply with state financial-disclosure laws when waging public referendum campaigns. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and freedom of speech. _ Let stand a ruling that the public has no right to attend hearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal trial jury while the trial is underway. The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess the validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986 racketeering trial of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. _ Cleared the way for a jury trial in former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King's $ 3.6 million libel lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a jury should hear <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column. _ Cleared the way for a trial in what may become an important test case on the power of cities to control rents and otherwise protect mobile home residents. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by owners of a mobile home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of their property's full value. In seeking help from the nation's highest court in the adult bookstore case, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> argued that `` neither interim nor permanent restraints of the type involved in this case may constitutionally be enforced prior to final judidical resolution'' unless the law guarantees speedy appellate review. The appeal noted that as yet no trial has been held to determine whether any of the materials seized from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> Books were obscene and therefore not constitutionally protected. The justices were told that `` a growing number of states are adopting similar RICO laws, and there is a conflict among the states as to their constitutionality.'' The adult bookstore cases are <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-470; and <LOCATION> Sappenfield </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-614.

 Fighting warm temperatures and wet snow, the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race were out of Finger Lake and on their way to <LOCATION> Rainy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> early today. Thirteen teams left the <LOCATION> Finger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> checkpoint, 193 miles from the 1,158-mile race's starting line, in one hour late Sunday. Twenty-three other teams had arrived at the checkpoint. <PERSON> Lavon </PERSON> <PERSON> Barve </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wasilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> pulled out at 7:39 p.m. They were followed by <PERSON> DeeDee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonrowe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, 1987 champion <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION>, four-time champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> of Two Rivers and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moerlein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kasilof </LOCATION>. Barve and <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> had declared their 24-hour layovers, then canceled the layover. All mushers are required to halt for one full 24 hour period during the race to rest themselves and their dogs. Temperatures in the <LOCATION> Rainy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> area were in the high 20s early today, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Temperatures that hovered around 32 degrees on Saturday took a toll on many of the sled dogs, which are accustomed to running in much colder weather. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nayokpuk </PERSON> was 18th into <LOCATION> Skwentna </LOCATION>, a checkpoint 148 miles from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, and notified officials he would take the race's mandatory 24-hour layover in <LOCATION> Skwentna </LOCATION> `` I've got to save some of my dogs,'' he said. `` I almost burned them up.

When the lead mushers reach <LOCATION> Puntilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rainy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, they will have covered 223 miles of the 1,158-mile race. Fifty-two teams started the race early Saturday. Defending champion Butcher finished last year's race in a record 11 days, two hours. The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed diphtheria serum to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> during an outbreak of the disease. The top 20 mushers will split a purse of $ 150,000.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of irate retirees rallied in the streets today as local banks remained shuttered, and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ousted vice president urged his countrymen to take up arms against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if the military leader did n't step down Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said ships were passing normally through the waterway despite reports that the nation's crisis was holding up passage of ships through the canal. About 300 retirees, chanting `` Justice,'' were joined by scores of younger supporters who cut off traffic on the city's main <LOCATION> Avenida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espana </LOCATION> in front of the towering <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> building. `` We little old people do n't have that much strength, but we'll hold out here as long as we can,'' said <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 63, a retired secretary At least 200 more retirees gathered in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to demonstrate. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime, under increasing pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, tried to assure the country's 60,000 retirees over the weekend that they would be able to cash their pension checks for the first two weeks of March. But it did not say how or where, and the pensioners were indignant. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, came out of the building to try to placate the retirees, and was surrounded by an antagonistic crowd. He told them they should go to another branch, but they refused to do so. Later in the morning, the government radio station said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would set up two payment booths in the afternoon to cash retirement checks. Banks fearing a run because of political instability closed last week. The government blames the closures on lack of funds resulting from the freezing of Panamanian government money deposited in five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s official currency is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, and the government periodically receives shipments of tender from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks where it keeps an estimated $ 50 million on deposit. A request for such a shipment last week was rejected because of legal action taken on behalf of <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was ousted from the presidency on Feb. 26. <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Friar </PERSON> said the rumors that ship traffic through the canal was being disrupted began with unconfirmed reports that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> port authorities _ which have been independent from the <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since 1979 _ were accepting payment only in cash. She said other forms of payment were being accepted for port services such as bunkering _ taking on fuel or water. She also said the great majority of the three dozen vessels that make the passage on an average day do not use the port facilities. She said all 38 vessels scheduled to make the passage Sunday did so, and that the 39 scheduled to pass through today were proceeding normally without delay. On Sunday, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ousted vice president, said from hiding that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does not relinquish power, Panamanians should take up arms against him. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from a house where he was staying, <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> warned Sunday: `` If peaceful means and the economic measures are not sufficient to achieve democracy, then I am the first to say that democracy must be obtained by fighting for it.'' <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> was ousted from office in a military-orchestrated coup on Feb. 26 along with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who also remains in hiding. The two men were removed from their posts a day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Many people think <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> does not have much capacity for violence, but it does,'' he said. The Education Ministry postponed the start of public school classes until further notice. Teachers were to have returned to school from vacation today for a week of preparation, with students beginning classes March 14. The ministry said in a statement the postponement was due to the climate of crisis. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 12 local banks have been shuttered since last Tuesday. Branches of international institutions closed their doors on Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> said it could not supply its member banks with tender and instructed them on Friday to remain closed until further notice. People have not been able to cash checks since Feb. 29, and stores have stopped accepting checks and credit cards. `` The entire population is prepared to suffer economic hardship,'' <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> said of mounting economic pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` And in a second phase, they are ready to sacrifice their lives.''

<HEAD>City Says Boys' Tree House Must Go</HEAD>

 Potential liability problems surrounding a tree house that extends two feet over public property have prompted city officials to give the structure the ax. `` It's accessible to the public, and there is the possibility it could entirely or partially fall on somebody passing by or damage property,'' said Chief Building Inspector <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidwell </PERSON>. The 8-by-6-foot tree house was built by <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON>'s father, a contractor, a few months ago as a Christmas present for her sons, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>, 4 It features wall-to-wall carpeting, a shingled roof and sliding plexiglass windows and is a popular place for neighborhood children to play. `` If I did n't have school, I'd spend every single day up there,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON>. `` My dad said, ` Whatever happened to the days of <PERSON> Huckleberry </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>?''' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON>. She said she understands the city's concern but added that few people use the sidewalk on their dead-end street. `` I've been up there on the windiest days and nothing has happened,'' she said. `` We'd have to have an earthquake or a nuclear war.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Macdonalds </ORGANIZATION> have until March 21 to remove the tree house. If the city does n't change its mind, they will build a foundation for it in their back yard and place it there.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an important victory for investors, today placed a heavy burden of proof on companies that are sued for denying they are holding merger negotiations after such preliminary talks are underway. By a 4-2 vote, the court said if companies withhold important information affecting stock prices, it must be presumed that investors who bought and sold the securities were relying on that information. `` An investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price,'' said Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> for the court. `` Because most publicly available information is reflected in market price, an investor's reliance on any public material misrepresentations, therefore, may be presumed. The absence of a five-vote majority in the case raises the possibility the issue could be reconsidered by the justices in another case with a different result. But, for now at least, today's decision is likely to have important repercussions on Wall Street. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last month, did not take part in considering the case. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> disqualified themselves from participating without explanation. The court ordered further hearings in a dispute involving <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. The company merged with <ORGANIZATION> CEBAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Combustion Engineering based in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, in December 1978. Stockholders said Basic executives falsely denied for 14 months prior to the merger that at least preliminary talks were underway between the two companies. As a result, many investors said they sold their stock at far less than its value. Combustion Engineering is a conglomerate that makes alumina or acid-based refractories _ non-metallic ceramic substances used as structural materials. Both Basic and Combustion Engineering were traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The stock of Basic was selling at well under $ 20 a share when merger rumors began surfacing in late 1977. There was a dramatic increase in the volume of activity in the stock accompanied by a sharp run-up in price. The eventual merger price of the stock was $ 46 a share. Company officials repeatedly said they could not account for the activity and denied merger negotiations were underway. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986 that public statements by Basic management during the period leading up to the merger were misleading or untrue, even if the company's denials of negotiations might be correct technically. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected the appellate court's reasoning that the company's denial of the preliminary talks by itself created grounds for the investors to win their suit. Information about a company that is otherwise insignificant does not become important _ or material to the stock's value _ solely because the company denied existence of the development, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` Materiality is something to be determined on the basis of the particular facts of each case,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` Materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.'' Using that standard, the court ordered further lower court hearings in the suit by investors in Basic who said they lost money because facts were withheld from them. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said the presumption at the new hearings must be that the investors would have relied on those facts, unless the management of Basic can prove otherwise. `` Where materially misleading statements have been disseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market for securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, in an opinion joined by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, said the ruling `` may have many adverse, unintended effects as it is applied and interpreted in the years to come.'' For example, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said many investors in Basic who are now suing may have doubted the company's denials that preliminary merger talks were underway. `` Such investors, the savviest of the savvy, will be able to recover under the court's opinion,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, 86-279.

 British soldiers and police shot and killed three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members and Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> today a `` dreadful terrorist act has been averted.'' News reports said two men and a woman were killed Sunday after they planted a car bomb and set it to go off Tuesday during a military parade in this British colony. But <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> denied the news reports and said no bomb had been planted. He said a second car linked to the guerrillas and parked in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> territory near border with <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, a British colony, contained three false passports and equipment, including an alarm clock, insulating tape, gloves and wire. `` There is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterday's events a dreadful terrorist act has been averted,'' said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` The three people killed were actively involved in the planning and attempted excecution of that act.'' He did not elaborate. British news reports said the two men and a woman were killed after authorities uncovered a plot to set off the car bomb. The reports quoted unidentified security sources. The reports said bomb-disposal experts defused 440 pounds of explosives in a Spanish-registered car parked near Gov. Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s official residence in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, on the southern tip of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. British Armed Forces Minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said `` an intelligence tip-off'' led to information about the three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the governor, said local police coordinated the effort. `` The operation was under the control of the <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> police commissioner, and British forces acted in support of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> police,'' he said. In an interview in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> 4 program, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> government of Chief Minister <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for military assistance `` under the standard arrangements because of the involvement of suspected terrorists.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the two men and a woman were unarmed when they were shot and killed by members of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Asked whether <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> police participated in the shooting, <PERSON> Sindon </PERSON> said: `` I am not in a position to comment on operational procedures.'' In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladolid </PERSON> said today <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police had tipped off British authorities more than a month ago about the presence of the suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members on <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s southern Costa del Sol. <ORGANIZATION> Valladolid </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials asked <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police to keep the three under surveillance but not to intervene. In a statement released Sunday in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the three were attached to `` active service units'' of its general headquarters in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. It extended `` deepest sympathy to the families of the volunteers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today identified the three as <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30; and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24. The report said they were driving to the airport when they were stopped by the police. It said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> served part of a 14-year prison sentence in connection with a hotel bombing in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> in 1976. <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s national news agency, said the car carrying the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members was stopped by police on a road leading to the Spanish border. British newspapers today quoted witnesses as saying plainclothes police officers jumped out of a vehicle and shot without warning at the three. They said one man and the woman fell on the spot and the other man had run 300 yards toward the town center before he was gunned down. The Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted officials as saying the purported bomb may have been timed to go off Tuesday when soldiers of the Royal Anglian Regiment are to take part in the changing of the guard ceremony. The regiment has just completed a tour in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Guardian, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, said today police were carrying out house-to-house searches in the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linea </LOCATION> on Sunday night for other members. The mainly Roman Catholic <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in a socialist state.

While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> picked up backing from another influential Georgian, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. As the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator left for a week-long trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, his office released a statement saying he had cast his absentee ballot for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> because `` his views come closest to my own views as to the steps our nation must take to meet our challenges at home and abroad.'' Four of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rivals _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ were in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today, as was <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ending his campaign day in his hometown of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which votes with 19 other states on Tuesday, offers a trove of 183 Democratic delegates and 111 on the Republican side. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> signed a brief order dismissing <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s libel suit `` with prejudice,'' which means that former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Calif. is legally the victor in the dispute <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> accepted the condition the judge imposed on Friday in a one-sentence letter from his attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> that was delivered to the judge's chambers by messenger. Under terms of the dismissal, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> must pay court fees, printing costs and court reporters' fees, but not <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s attorney's fees, which he has said total about $ 400,000 `` This is a confirmation of my integrity,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said today in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I do n't like at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> He is admitting that he is the one who is the liar.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded Sunday he was involved in `` a long, hard fight'' for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination and he had little cause for optimism about his prospects on Tuesday when 17 states hold <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries and 20 hold Democratic contests. There are 712 Republican and 1,307 Democratic delegates at stake, including the four to be selected from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. Southern and border states dominate the day and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a `` 2-1 or a 3-1 lead in virtually every Southern state.'' The vice president demonstrated his strength in the region on Saturday when he overwhelmed his rivals in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary and swept the state's 37 delegates. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked strongest with leads in surveys in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the two biggest Super Tuesday states, and a lock on his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which also votes on Tuesday. `` It could be he'll come out of Super Tuesday the front-runner,'' said a <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aide of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, during his meeting Sunday evening with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, predicted no clear winner on Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support in the black community gives him the biggest Southern base of any candidate. Interviewed Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' he said, `` I'm running strong in the South,'' but he refused to predict how many delegates he might win in the region. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> appeared on the same program and conceded he needs to win more than his home state of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on Tuesday. He predicted he would carry `` several other'' states, but refused to say which ones. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Meet the Press'' and said that if he does n't get 200 to 300 delegates on Tuesday `` it will be difficult.'' The vast Super Tuesday landscape was too much for any candidate to cover in person. Millions of dollars was being spent to reach voters through television and radio commercials, with many of the candidates trying to sell themselves by attacking their rivals. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> commercials accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of dirty tricks against other Democratic contenders, while the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was running an ad showing an acrobat doing flips, a pointed reference to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> shifts on issues. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> continued to run commercials attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, while the vice president was portraying the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator as straddling on taxes.

 Two noted sex experts who criticized health authorities for failing to stress the extent of the AIDS epidemic said today that their own estimates of the spread of AIDS were based on beliefs and estimates, not scientific evidence. `` We did not project our own database on to the general population,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON>, co-author with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of `` Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior in the Age of AIDS.'' <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> said at a press conference this morning that the authors' assertion that AIDS is `` now running rampant in the heterosexual community'' was an estimate based on analysis of existing studies that have appeared in scientific journals. It was not based on original research by the authors, he said. Masters, asked for his justification of the claim, said, `` I simply believe it.'' The authors criticized health authorities for failing to stress the threat of AIDS to heterosexuals, and they have themselves been criticized by an AIDS expert for making recommendations that might alarm the public. But in their book Masters, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> say that medical experts have played down their findings rather than present worst-case scenarios `` in the understandable wish to avoid mass panic.'' The book calls for widespread mandatory testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection by pregnant women, couples seeking marriage licenses and hospital patients between ages 15 and 60. Excerpts from the book are appearing in this week's issue of Newsweek magazine. The authors run the Masters and <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and wrote a best-seller, `` Human Sexual Response.'' But some AIDS experts questioned their conclusions on the spread of the deadly disease. `` Masters and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> may have expertise in sexuality but they have no credentials to justify their recommendations concerning AIDS public health policy _ recommendations that will surely alarm the public,'' said <PERSON> Mathilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Krim </PERSON>, founding chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research. `` From everything we know today, such mandatory testing schemes will not help protect the public,'' she said Saturday. Masters and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s book suggests that to guard against infection, potential sexual partners undergo tests and remain monogamous. Dr. <PERSON> Beny </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Primm </PERSON>, a member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s AIDS commission, said he agreed that recent optimistic reports about heterosexuals could `` lull people into a state of complacency.'' He said as a result many `` do n't use condoms, still are promiscuous and still participate in group sex or other dangerous activities.'' The book disputed estimates that there are now about 1.5 million people infected with the virus in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is quite likely that there are now 3 million or more carriers of the AIDS virus in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, most of whom are otherwise healthy and unaware of their infected, contagious state,'' it said. `` Experts generally are gravely underestimating the degree to which the AIDS virus has spread into the heterosexual community,'' it said. The authors said they based their findings on their own study of 800 sexually active heterosexual adults between the ages of 21 and 40 who met three criteria: no blood transfusions received since 1977; no use of illicit drugs by injection; no homosexual or bisexual contact since 1977. The study, however, did not appear to follow the usual scientific process and the authors conceded that their sample was not obtained by random sampling methods and did not closely match the general <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. They said they found that among a subgroup of subjects who average more than 12 partners annually and generally failed to take precautions, 14 percent of the women had been infected with the AIDS virus and 12 percent of the men. The findings were an indication, the researchers said, that'' public health authorities have failed to impress the general public with the message that AIDS has broken out.

<HEAD>Court Gives Investors Important Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an important victory for investors, today placed a heavy burden of proof on companies that are sued for denying they are holding merger negotiations after such preliminary talks are underway. By a 4-2 vote, the court said if companies withhold important information affecting stock prices, it must be presumed that investors who bought and sold the securities were relying on that information. `` An investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price,'' said Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> for the court. `` Because most publicly available information is reflected in market price, an investor's reliance on any public material misrepresentations, therefore, may be presumed. The absence of a five-vote majority in the case raises the possibility the issue could be reconsidered by the justices in another case with a different result. But, for now at least, today's decision is likely to have important repercussions on Wall Street. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last month, did not take part in considering the case. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> disqualified themselves from participating without explanation. The court ordered further hearings in a dispute involving <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. The company merged with <ORGANIZATION> CEBAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Combustion Engineering based in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, in December 1978. Stockholders said Basic executives falsely denied for 14 months prior to the merger that at least preliminary talks were underway between the two companies. As a result, many investors said they sold their stock at far less than its value. Combustion Engineering is a conglomerate that makes alumina or acid-based refractories _ non-metallic ceramic substances used as structural materials. Both Basic and Combustion Engineering were traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The stock of Basic was selling at well under $ 20 a share when merger rumors began surfacing in late 1977. There was a dramatic increase in the volume of activity in the stock accompanied by a sharp run-up in price. The eventual merger price of the stock was $ 46 a share. Company officials repeatedly said they could not account for the activity and denied merger negotiations were underway. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986 that public statements by Basic management during the period leading up to the merger were misleading or untrue, even if the company's denials of negotiations might be correct technically. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected the appellate court's reasoning that the company's denial of the preliminary talks by itself created grounds for the investors to win their suit. Information about a company that is otherwise insignificant does not become important _ or material to the stock's value _ solely because the company denied existence of the development, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` Materiality is something to be determined on the basis of the particular facts of each case,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` Materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.'' Using that standard, the court ordered further lower court hearings in the suit by investors in Basic who said they lost money because facts were withheld from them. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said the presumption at the new hearings must be that the investors would have relied on those facts, unless the management of Basic can prove otherwise. `` Where materially misleading statements have been disseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market for securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, in an opinion joined by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, said the ruling `` may have many adverse, unintended effects as it is applied and interpreted in the years to come.'' For example, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said many investors in Basic who are now suing may have doubted the company's denials that preliminary merger talks were underway. `` Such investors, the savviest of the savvy, will be able to recover under the court's opinion,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, 86-279.

<HEAD>Eccentric: A Perfectly Sane Way To Be, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 People who hunt vampires, live in caves or slide down buildings in pink elephant costumes are n't crazy. They're just eccentric, and more creative than everybody else, says a researcher who spent three years studying them. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, principal clinical psychologist at the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, interviewed 130 eccentrics and said he found only one insane person in the crowd. He has turned his findings into a book called `` Eccentrics: The Scientific Investigation,'' to be published in May by <ORGANIZATION> Stirling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was the first scientific study of its kind in the world,'' Weeks said in a telephone interview Monday. His study exploded a few myths _ among them that Britons are more eccentric than Americans. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has more of a reputation'' for eccentricity, said Weeks, an American from <LOCATION> Garwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1975. But both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seem to have more eccentrics than other countries, possibly because they have the strongest traditions of free speech, according to Weeks. It's also a myth that British eccentrics are mainly aristocrats. `` They're mostly in the upper middle class _ professional people,'' the psychologist said, and they tend to be outspoken loners. Weeks cites <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> as an eccentric, given his interest in unconventional medicine, his habit of talking to plants, his solitary trips to meditate and his peevish outbursts against modern architecture. `` He'd probably be a lot more eccentric if he were n't royalty,'' the psychologist said. `` That probably restricts him.'' Weeks reckons one person in 10,000 is an eccentric. They tend to be highly creative and have vivid imaginations and graphic dreams. `` They have lots of good ideas,'' Weeks said. `` However, they can be inflexible. If they get a good idea, they stick with it.'' The eccentrics Weeks met included a man who has lived in a cave for eight years. Another eccentric scales office buildings in a pink elephant costume and has built a `` helimobile,'' a contraption with wheels, wings, flashing lights and an engine. `` It moves, but it does n't fly,'' Weeks said. Then there was a teacher from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who set up a vampire investigation bureau, which is open at night. The teacher travels the world hunting the bloodthirsty creatures. And a Scottish lady offered herself as a virgin sacrifice in a mock ritual atop a extinct volcano in the middle of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. Only one turned out to be insane, Weeks said. He thought he was a secret agent and demonstrated a throat-cutting technique on Week' research assistant, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, with a set of keys Weeks and Ms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> found eccentrics by word of mouth and publicity about their work. People who thought they qualified as eccentrics were given mental and personality tests. Eccentrics tend to be happier than most people because they do n't take themselves too seriously, Weeks said. `` They just have this good sense of humor,'' he said.

 Hundreds of students today shut down <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only university for the deaf, out of anger over the selection of a president who is not hearing impaired. The school was closed early this morning after an estimated 600 students blocked campus entrances, said <PERSON> Thomasina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the school's security force. Joining the students, who were supported by faculty members and alumni, was at least one high-ranking administrator, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> of Student Life <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON>, who told a reporter, `` I have never felt so defeated.'' At issue is the selection of <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, now vice chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>, chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1864 as the only liberal arts college for the deaf, has never had a deaf president. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said students blocked campus entrances with their cars about 6 a.m. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, the school's vice president for business, closed the university a short time later. `` It's totally impossible for employees to get in,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The board said it would meet with the protesting students, but only if they allowed traffic on and off the campus. The students refused. Besides a deaf president, the students were demanding the resignation of board chairman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> and a change in the make-up of the 20-member board to increase the number of deaf members from four to more than half. A city police officer, Capt. <PERSON> M.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said he expected no arrests as long as the demonstration remained peaceful. Turk, walking with students outside the school, said the board was the problem. `` I've been on the Gallaudet payroll for 35 years,'' said <PERSON> Turk </PERSON>, who is deaf. `` I have never felt so defeated. I do not think I will ever experience a more frustrating feeling in my life. Obviously, we need to overhaul our board of trustees completely. ... They must go _ now.'' After <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>'s selection was announced late Sunday night, students marched 60 blocks from the campus in northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the downtown hotel where the university's board was meeting, and back again. On the way back, the marchers passed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, then sat at the foot of the Capitol grounds, where they were faced for half an hour by a line of 25 city police officers. Earlier Sunday, throngs of students, faculty and alumni had gathered at the school's gates and waved signs urging `` Deaf President Now.'' `` It's important for us,'' student <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said. `` A deaf president is a role model of all deaf people. He is a leader of the whole deaf community.'' Students, faculty and alumni had been urging the appointment of one of the deaf candidates for several weeks. In picking <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, the school's trustes bypassed two deaf candidates. The deaf candidates for the job were <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corson </PERSON>, 44, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> board member; and I. King <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 45, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Both are <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> graduates. The cause of a deaf president has had strong support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Republican presidential candidates <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have urged the board to name the school's first deaf president. `` In 124 years we did n't give them a chance,'' residence hall supervisor <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Breindel </PERSON> wrote on note paper. `` Like eating Italian food in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant _ strange.'' <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, who has been vice chancellor at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> since 1983, said she plans to take the new job despite the protests. `` Very soon I hope to have the opportunity to be a real person to them,'' she said. <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> said the most important step for her now is to develop skills to communicate with the deaf community. She does not know sign language, but is taking classes in it. <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> had been chosen `` because neither of the other two candidates had the breadth of her experience.'' The vote was 10-4 for <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>. Of the four deaf board members, three voted against <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>; one could not vote because he was a candidate for the job. `` We are aware that it is inevitable that there will be a period where intense disappointment will take over,'' <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> said. `` We know that it will not be easily or quickly erased. We are convinced that, given a chance, both students and the deaf community at large will respond.'' <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> received her doctorate in educational psychology from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> in 1972. She also has a bachelor's degree in nursing from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a master's degree in management from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The previous president, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, left in January to become a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Bassett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, run by the board chairman's family. <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> has an enrollment of 2,200 university students, 400 high school students and 200 elementary school students. Nearly all the undergraduates are deaf. School spokesman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Voyet </PERSON> said life at <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION> is similar to that at other colleges except for the ways in which people communicate. Students are `` taught in the total communication method, which is signed English and voice,'' said <PERSON> Voyet </PERSON>, `` so that no matter what method the student uses to communicate, it's available to him. A lot of students in their schools learned how to lip read as well as sign.'' The students use TTY machines, which have typewriters with screens, to talk on the telephone; strobe lilghts replace fire alarms. `` Otherwise, its basically the same'' as other universities,'' <PERSON> Voyet </PERSON> said. `` You just do n't hear a lot of voices. Other than signing, there's nothing different. They live in dorms, play sports, have homecoming. It's a university with the normal university things. The communication method is a little different in some respect, but that's it.''

<HEAD>Two Blacks Killed In Police Shootout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two blacks described by police as `` trained terrorists'' were killed, and six policemen were slightly injured in a shootout at a house in <LOCATION> Queenstown </LOCATION>, police said Monday. Police, acting on a tip, surrounded a house in the southern city on Friday afternoon and ordered the inhabitants to leave. When the occupants refused, police threw `` stun grenades'' into the house, police said in a statement. A stun grenade contains no shrapnel and is considered non-lethal. A shootout ensued, and two black men inside the house were killed. The six officers suffered minor injuries, the statement said. Police did not say how they knew the men were `` trained terrorists.'' Also Monday, police said they expelled seven police reservists because they were members of the extreme right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The paramilitary group seeks a whites-only homeland within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and has been taking an increasingly confrontational stance recently against the white-led government. Several thousand members marched on government buildings on Feb. 27 to present a petition calling for an all-white state. The government said last week it would dismiss policemen holding membership in the organization. The seven reservists, from northern <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province, were the first policemen expelled under the government's new policy.

 A two-headed shrimp a fisherman found in his bait bucket appears to be the first such specimen on record, experts say. `` We're dealing with a first occurrence here, I guess, to the best of our knowledge,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ecology division in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rackets Run Rampant In Mobster-Riddled Republic, Pravda Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corruption is so rampant in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> that a powerful underworld has developed, complete with hit men, protection rackets, police payoffs and powerful mob chieftains, Pravda said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper even noted that the funeral of an underworld crime boss drew 400 mourners. Pravda said many police officers not only looked the other way at crime in the Central Asian republic, but masterminded some of the schemes. It said 12 are now are on trial for extortion. `` They extorted money mostly from those who would n't appeal to the police, like a certain <PERSON> Gavrush </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkisya </PERSON>, a former shop foreman, who confessed to the police later that he owed the criminals -LRB- $ 150,000 -RRB-,'' Pravda said. `` And they threatened him with a firing squad should he fail to pay up.'' Other Central Asian republics also have been blasted by the Soviet media for large-scale corruption. In recent months, the media have exposed millions of dollars in graft in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>'s neighbor to the north. On Jan. 20, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that the head of an agricultural complex in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> built his own mob empire, complete with his own courts and an underground prison constructed by 1,000 workers. The expose was striking in its recitation of abuses. Pravda's account on <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, while not as dramatic, was the strongest criticism yet of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s southernmost republic, which has 3.27 million people, mostly Moslems. Official media criticism of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> usually has centered around Moslem customs judged by the central government to be abhorent, such as reports of young women being killed for insufficient marriage dowries. `` The republic suffers a difficult situation, created over years of bureaucratic rule,'' Pravda said. Referring to the swelling bureacracy, it added: `` Every sixth person in the republic is a hack official. `` Many highly placed police officials, and policemen of lesser ranks, were involved in all kinds of crimes and often acted as their skilled masterminds,'' the newspaper reported. Pravda said the crackdown in the region began with the recent appointment of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Udalov </PERSON> as the republic's police chief. Pravda said he was threatened shortly after taking office by <PERSON> Ilyas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkiev </PERSON>, one of those now on trial. `` Just leave me alone. Quit this case. Several hundred thousand rubles will go your way,'' <PERSON> Sarkiev </PERSON> was quoted as telling <PERSON> Udalov </PERSON>. `` Also keep in mind. I know the city your daughter lives in. I have nothing to lose, you know. You wo n't be able to get all my people.'' The newspaper said that <PERSON> Sarkiev </PERSON> was arrested three days after making the threat. Pravda also described a threat against <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allaverdov </PERSON>, the manager of a footwear shop in <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION>. He reported that when he had a falling out with <PERSON> Sarkiev </PERSON>, violence began. <PERSON> Allaverdov </PERSON> told authorities his new car was stolen and found burned the next morning in the center of the city. The windows of his apartment were shot out, he said, and he received a threat that his son would be kidnapped. Pravda said the recent crackdown has routed several `` criminals'' from official posts in <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, but it noted that a recent funeral illustrated continuing problems. `` A well-known underworld figure died in a traffic accident. Four hundred criminals came to his funeral from different cities, which goes to show the atmosphere in <LOCATION> Ashkhabad </LOCATION> quite well,'' Pravda said.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Farmer Bankruptcy Issue in Minnesota Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously today that financially troubled farmers may not avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to use their labor, experience and expertise in continuing to operate their farm. By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to `` adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law can not be satisified by such a promise. The ruling is a key setback for many farmers who suffered financial difficulty in the early 1980s. One such couple was <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON>, grain and livestock farmers who farm about 840 acres of land in <LOCATION> Nobles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. The Ahlers have outstanding loans with two <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> banks, <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>. Today's decision, overturning a ruling by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, is a victory for the two banks. Between 1965 and 1982 the Ahlers obtained four loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, securing each of the loans with a separate parcel of land they owned. Between 1982 and 1984 they obtained additional loans from <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION>, securing them with a second mortgage on the land used to secure the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans and a first mortgage on their farm's machinery, equipment, crops and livestock. The Ahlers defaulted on the loans _ over $ 500,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and about $ 450,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION>. Just after <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> went to court in an attempt to take control of the <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON>' assets, the couple filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law. That move automatically froze <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION>'s collection efforts in a state court. The two banks, claiming they were undersecured creditors, sought the bankruptcy judge's help in seizing control of the Ahlers' assets The banks said the <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON> could not protect their secured interest in the outstanding loans. The bankruptcy judge and a federal trial judge cleared the way for foreclosure on the <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON>' farm but the 8th Circuit court reversed those rulings in 1986. The appeals court ruled that the banks' right to adequate protection could be satisified by the <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON>' promise to continue to work their farm with the experience and expertise they bring to the job. The banks then successfully sought <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, joined by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in urging a reversal of the appeals court ruling. Writing for the court today, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the appeals court ruling wrongly carved out an exception to the `` absolute priority rule'' of bankruptcy law. That rule bars people who file for bankruptcy from getting anything out of a reorganization plan unless all creditors are paid off in full. `` We find no support in the -LRB- bankruptcy -RRB- code or our previous decisions for the court of appeals' application of the absolute rule in this case,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` We conclude that the rule applies here, and -LRB- the <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON>' -RRB- promise of future labor warrants no exception to its operation.'' Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the decision. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Ahler </PERSON>, 86-958.

 Guilt drove a man to turn himself in and confess after more than two years on the run since he bludgeoned and strangled his sister in a dispute over money, police say. `` I think the police are looking for me,'' officials quoted <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> as saying when he walked into a police station Saturday evening. <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON>, 54, was charged Sunday with second-degree murder in the killing of his sister, <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON>, 62, in the apartment they shared on Sept. 30, 1985. `` He did it in a fit of anger ... and because of a financial situation he was in,'' said Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> also was charged with attempted murder for the beating of a neighbor, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turel </PERSON>, now 50, on the same day. Detectives said that during his confession <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> said he turned himself in because the guilt was driving him toward suicide. <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said that at the time of the slaying <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> was penniless and in debt to a loanshark for $ 8,400. On the morning of the slaying, <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> made his sister breakfast. While she was in the kitchen, he struck her on the head with a piece of pipe, dragged her into a bedroom and strangled her with rope, <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said. While fleeing he encountered <PERSON> Turel </PERSON> and beat her over the head with a pair of pliers before kicking her down a flight of stairs, <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turel </PERSON> needed 67 stitches in the head. He disappeared after the attack but police watched the apartment for three months because a hit list of neighbors was discovered inside, Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> said he took $ 40 from the house and began wandering up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. He got a Social Security number under a phony name and alternated between getting welfare and temporary work. <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> started drinking a quart of vodka a day to try to dull the memory of killing his sister. Three weeks ago, he phoned <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanislaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to find out where his sister was buried.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are monitoring Polish and East German cooperation with efforts to close down an arms trading office affiliated with the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> terrorist group. According to a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> kept an apartment in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and his associates ran a trade operation from an office tower there after he was forced to leave <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1983. Last summer, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats began pressuring the Polish government privately, and in August the Poles promised to close the operation, S.A.S.-International Commerce and Investments, and order its staff to leave the country. A similar operation was closed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The front offices have been shut down in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` They have told us and we believe that they have been shut down.'' `` This does n't necessarily mean that these governments have ended all their contacts with <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s associates for good. We'd like to think so It is something that remains to be seen,'' said the source, who like others interviewed over the past week spoke on condition of anonymity. Polish officials insisted that the government `` had no idea'' what S.A.S. was. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say Polish security agencies must have known that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> had overall control over <ORGANIZATION> S.A.S. </ORGANIZATION>, and that the organization was selling Soviet-bloc arms in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` There are factions in these governments, and top political leaders and places like the foreign ministries might not have known what was going on,'' one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government terrorism expert said. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, nom de guerre of Palestinian-born <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, is now believed to live in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, according to Soviet-bloc and administration sources. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group is blamed for numerous terrorist incidents, including attacks in the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports on Dec. 27, 1985, in which 18 people were killed. The head of <ORGANIZATION> S.A.S. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Najmeddin </PERSON>, was forced to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Jan. 14, several days after the departure of his top deputy, according to Polish officials. The Poles delayed the expulsions for nearly a month past a promised December deadline, upsetting some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterterrorism officials who pushed for release of an unclassified version of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats dealing with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, meanwhile, sought to keep the affair under wraps, administration sources said. Some details of the report were published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, however, angering Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who complained about the leak during a January meeting in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> with Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in the department, sources said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> expressed `` regret'' about the disclosure, the sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report, which was discussed by administration officials but not shown to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Najmeddin </PERSON> settled in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in 1973 at No. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Bagno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION>, Apt. 24, and founded S.A.S. 10 years later to sell arms and other goods abroad, mainly in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. S.A.S. maintained offices on the 25th floor of the Intraco Building in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> earned badly needed foreign currency from the enterprise, and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group kept most of the profit as well as weapons. S.A.S. was the most important link in a chain of legitimate business enterprises affiliated with <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report said. The East Germans allowed an <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> affiliate called <ORGANIZATION> Zibado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> to keep an office on <LOCATION> Friedrichstrasse </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1983-86, but now have closed it, and Bulgarian officials also have curtailed their ties with terrorist organizations, according to a senior administration source. Polish government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> announced the closure of the S.A.S. office in January and said authorities did not know whether <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> had ever been in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` I am saying this cautiously, because the authorities can not exclude'' that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> entered the country under another name, Urban told reporters. According to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> presided over at least four meetings in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, two in December 1983, again in September 1984 and most recently in June 1987. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, S.A.S. dealt with the <ORGANIZATION> Etat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cenzin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and paid its representative, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchewska </PERSON>, $ 600 a month to facilitate visas for Palestinian operatives and obtain customs clearances for shipments of pistols, rifles and hand-held anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report said many of these weapons went to terrorists linked to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. In the summer of 1984, the report said, S.A.S sold <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> 4,000 Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifles made in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for about $ 500,000. The next year, S.A.S. was agent for the sale of rifles and pistols in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In 1986, the report said, the company obtained 115 British <ORGANIZATION> Enfield </ORGANIZATION> anti-riot weapons, keeping 15 and giving 100 to East German authorities. Additionally, the report said, S.A.S. sponsored scholarships for Palestinians to study in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and some of them were recruited into <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s terrorist organization.

Fertility of the egg, laid last Thursday, was confirmed this morning when condor keepers briefly held it up to a high intensity lamp and detected a preliminary stage of development, park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON> said. The egg was returned to an incubator, where it will be kept until the expected hatching between April 28 and May 3. All of the 27 living <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors are in captivity, 14 at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. Of the 27, 13 were hatched in captivity as part of an effort to build a breeding flock to save the rare birds from extinction. Meanwhile, the parents of the condor egg were said to be doing well. Keepers removed the egg from its nest at the park's `` condorminium'' to stimulate more breeding activity by the pair, and that's what's happening `` That's real positive,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That would lead us to hope for the production of a second egg, which could come as early as 30 days after the first egg.'' `` The parents are doing fine, the egg is doing fine, the keepers are doing fine,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> added.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. ADULT BOOKSTORES The court agreed to decide whether states may use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult bookstores. The justices said they will review a pair of free-speech challenges to such an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-470; and <LOCATION> Sappenfield </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-614. DEATH PENALTY The court agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> man convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978. The court is expected to use the case to study death row inmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal courts for help and to decide whether <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> juries may be told their life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trial judge's approval. The case is <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 87-121. VACCINE The court left intact a $ 1.13 million jury award to an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> boy paralyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination for three diseases.

The case is <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Toner </PERSON>, 87-1151. FARM BANKRUPTCY The court ruled unanimously that financially troubled farmers may not avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to use their labor, experience and expertise in continuing to operate their farm. By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to `` adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law can not be satisfied by such a promise. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Ahler </PERSON>, 86-958. CHURCHES The court refused to free churches from having to comply with state financial-disclosure laws when waging public referendum campaigns. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and freedom of speech. The case is <PERSON> Bemis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pentacostal </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, 87-317. SECRET HEARINGS The court let stand a ruling that the public has no right to attend hearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal trial jury while the trial is underway. The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess the validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986 racketeering trial of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Times-Picayune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 87-872. GLOBE LIBEL The court cleared the way for a jury trial in former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King's $ 3.6 million libel lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a jury should hear <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. King, 87-731. MOBILE HOMES The court cleared the way for a trial in what may become an important test case on the power of cities to control rents and otherwise protect mobile home residents. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by owners of a mobile home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of their property's full value. The case is <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> vs. Hall, 87-220. <PERSON> JEHOVAH </PERSON>'S WITNESS The court refused to hear the appeal of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman who says she was denied custody of her young child because she is a <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witness. The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings that bar <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> from exposing her daughter to any of her religious beliefs. The case is <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, 87-1166. CITIES The court said it will try again to decide whether cities may be sued successfully when citizens' rights are violated due to alleged inadequate training of municipal employees.

 Members of this city's influential construction unions threw rocks and eggs and shouted pro-union slogans today outside the annual convention of the Associated Builders and Contractors, officials said. Police in helmets were called in to keep traffic flowing outside <LOCATION> Moscone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, where about 2,000 demonstrators from the building trade councils of three <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area counties stood five-deep blocking buses carrying convention guests and their families, officers reported.

The association is a fast-growing organization of 19,000 employers who hire mostly non-union workers. Although 2,000 association members were expected at the meeting, only 400 had arrived when it opened. Union members claim the contractors' organization is seeking to break union control of construction projects.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s top police officer testified today at Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial that he was `` surprised and shocked'' when the governor told him not to cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat. Department of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told him last Nov. 15 the alleged threat `` was a family spat.'' Impeachment charges against the 63-year-old <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, first-term Republican, included a charge that he tried to thwart an investigation of the alleged threat. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> as saying, `` The attorney general is out to hang me and I'm not going to help him in any way ... Do n't tell the attorney general anything.'' `` He said, ` Never, do n't give them any help,''' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> said. `` This whole situation surprised and shocked me ... I just can not cover up, even if the governor is the one telling me to do that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided earlier this morning not to grant immunity to the man accused of making the threat, former state official <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> told lawmakers that granting immunity to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, former head of state prison construction, could wind up protecting him from prosecution for alleged crimes `` you have no way of knowing about today.'' Senators were considering whether to grant `` use immunity'' to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to force him to say whether he threatened the life of <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> last November, which would have meant his testimony could not be used against him in criminal court. On Friday, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said today that if the state grand jury probe were over he would have no problem with testifying. `` These are the people -LRB- the attorney general's office -RRB- that are out to get the governor,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` Anybody that gets in the middle is going to get hurt.'' Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s voice vote, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> admitted he had n't expected to get immunity. A grant of immunity should be made only if the testimony sought is central to the case, if lawmakers think <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> will tell the truth and if the immunity will not compromise a criminal investigation, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. A state grand jury investigation of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is continuing, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense lawyer, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, accused prosecutors of trying to harm <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' reputation in testimony last week and of `` splattering the mud broadly enough so that it splatters on the respondent -LRB- <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> -RRB-.'' Department of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> also was scheduled to take the stand today. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused of ordering <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s investigation of the alleged threat. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached Nov. 5 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which also accused him of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has been investigated by the state grand jury in connection with the alleged threat but has not been charged. Attorneys said last week the inquiry was continuing. Last Friday, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, head of the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, testified that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told her Nov. 12 that Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a former special gubernatorial assistant who was about to testify before the grand jury on the $ 350,000 loan, was a `` bad girl.'' She told the trial that if Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> kept talking `` she is going to take a long boat ride.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has denied making a threat, and prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> asked him Friday if he had taken six lie-dectector tests in an effort to prove he had n't made the threat. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> refused to answer the question. Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> also testified that when she described the alleged threat to <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' boss, he shrugged it off as `` just a bunch of hot air.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, in testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment committee in January, acknowledged that he may have told <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with the attorney general's probe. However, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also contended he was not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation before his conversation with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, did not attend the first five days of testimony last week. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and remove him from office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a May 17 recall election and a March 22 criminal trial in connection with the $ 350,000 campaign loan.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to study the appeal of a convicted <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> murderer sentenced to 50 to 100 years in prison for his crime. The justices said they will use <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' case to give federal courts some further guidance in how to handle the appeals of defendants convicted in state courts. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was convicted of the July 19, 1977, murder in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Earnest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION>. After his conviction was upheld by the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> courts on direct appeal, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> filed a so-called habeas corpus appeal in state courts. In it, he contended for the first time that he was denied adequate legal help at his trial. State courts ruled that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> could not raise that issue because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, but it then rejected the merits of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' ineffective-assistance argument. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> then sought help from the federal courts, in a habeas corpus petition raising the same issue. A federal trial judge ruled that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' procedural default, which usually would preclude federal court review of his claim, had been waived by the state courts. But the 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last June 12 ruled that the procedural default blocks federal court review of the ineffective-assistance argument. The case is <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> vs. Reed, 87-5677.

 Six <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships assembled in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Monday, prompting rumors of retaliation for an Iranian attack on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> helicopters, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> called the ship movements routine. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Monday its anti-aircraft batteries fired on two helicopters over the weekend, forcing them to withdraw, because the choppers ignored a warning to stay clear of an `` Iranian zone'' in the gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> issued a similar account earlier. Rumors of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> action spread through shipping circles in the gulf, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980, when six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels were spotted off <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. They included a chartered tanker and combat stores ship. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> denied the rumors. `` We would n't be planning an attack with a supply ship,'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. `` These movements were scheduled long before the helicopter incident.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the helicopters were `` forced to flee'' by anti-aircraft fire at about midnight Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had said American helicopters took `` evasive action'' after machine guns were fired from an oil platform and several small boats during a scouting mission ahead of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. They did not say how many choppers were involved. Neither report gave the location of the oil platform or named it, but the American versian said it was not the <PERSON> Rostam </PERSON> platform, which four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyers shelled Oct. 19. <PERSON> Rostam </PERSON> has been reported under repair since the raid, described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as a `` measured response'' to an attack in which an Iranian Silkworm missile damaged a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker anchored at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s main oil terminal. At the time, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said more severe reprisals could be expected if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked other American ships or aircraft. Since last July, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships have protected Kuwaiti tankers sailing under the American flag. Eleven of the sheikdom's tankers have been given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> registration. The <PERSON> Rostam </PERSON> precedent combined with the sighting of the six ships to encourage the rumors of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for retaliation. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers said two of the ships, the guided missile frigates <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, were learning the ropes as new members of the gulf-based fleet, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION>. They were escorting the 18,000-ton stores ship <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and the 39,000-ton oiler L.H. <PERSON> Gianella </PERSON>, both on resupply missions, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. He said it was `` just coincidental'' that the four ships were spotted near the missile cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> and missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, which have been in the gulf for weeks and were on `` routine escort duty'' off <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf operation, which has been cut from 17 to 16 ships, the <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> are expected to replace sister frigates <PERSON> McClusky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, the next vessels slated to depart under <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> policy that limits duty tours to six months, port-to-port. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s account of the helicopter incident said: `` Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters attempting to approach an Iranian zone in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> early Sunday were forced to flee by the anti-aircraft fire of naval forces of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` The navy anti-aircraft detected the two helicopters on its radar and warned them to stay out of the Iranian zone. However, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> navy fired warning shots after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters violated the Iranian zone.'' Nothing was said in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> version about a warning before the shooting started. It was the second time in a month that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed to have driven off <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> helicopters with anti-aircraft fire. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied the first Iranian report, of a similar incident Feb. 12 at <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> island in the south central Gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> uses some oil platforms and small islands in the gulf as bases for armed speedboats that attack commercial shipping. There have been no such attacks since Feb. 11, and no Iraqi air raids on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s own oil shipping since Feb. 12 _ one of the longest lulls in the `` tanker war'' since it began in February 1984. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been attacking each other's capitals and other cities since Feb. 29, in a new round of the `` war of the cities'' that has cost thousands of lives during the 7 -LCB- - year-old war

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said today it has protested poor maintenance of some <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal facilities, but said the problem was not linked to the recent political turmoil there. `` There are some facilities that are maintained by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that we have protested in a sense of not being adequately maintained,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He said the complaint was registered `` sometime previously'' and was not intended to justify an abrogation of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty. Meanwhile, a newspaper reported that political appointees installed by the Panamanian government are mismanaging operations of the canal that have been turned over by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Any user of those facilities will tell you there are difficulties now that simply did not exist 10 years ago,'' an unidentified Panamanian economist told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Among the facilities suffering from mismanagement are ports, marine bunkering installations, a railroad, a bridge and air traffic control, according to the Times, which interviewed canal employees and shipping experts. `` This government has put a political aspect to an equation that has no room for politics,'' said a Panamanian engineer who has worked at the canal for more than a decade. `` As soon as you start to mix Panamanian politics with the running of the canal, that is the end of things.'' The country's political situation has been particularly troubled in recent weeks. Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the military leader who is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is in hiding, as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s rightful president and has brought economic pressure to bear to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is also under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for alleged drug trafficking. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is scheduled to take control of the waterway in the year 2000, according to the 1977 treaties. But some of the 7,000 canal employees, 83 percent of whom are Panamanians, fear that domestic political interference could hinder their ability to run the canal professionally, the Times said. `` As the year 2000 approaches, it is going to be necessary for laws to keep this organization a bit apart from the normal government structure, so there is no interference by other ministries or the implantation of political but unskilled people in the upper echelons,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and chief administrator of the canal. A Panamanian civil engineer told the newspaper that derailments on the railroad have increased because of lack of maintenance and that rail yards `` are in a state of disrepair.'' Shipping lines complain that lights and gangways do n't work and that fenders along docks are not maintained. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> have taken some of the best office buildings for their own use as warehouses or as prisons, the Times reported, forcing some canal operations to move elsewhere.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lashed out today at congressional opponents to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid, accusing them of a lack of courage in the battle against communism in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> talked about the votes last week in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that left the rebels battling the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicragua </LOCATION> without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding. The 216-208 vote defeated a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to provide $ 30.8 million in food, clothing and medical aid to the rebels. The vote was scheduled by the Democratic leadership so the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could not vote on an aid plan favored by the Republicans. `` Courage has n't exactly been the watchword of some opponents of Contra aid,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` ... Last week, aid opponents tried to pass the buck of responsibility for abandoning in the field the young men and women of the Democratic resistance, and that ploy failed as it should have.'' Administration officials have expressed the hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could come up with an alternative plan to keep the rebels alive as a fighting force. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that a `` real problem'' exists for the administration because a new Contra aid package might not be considered for some time. `` It's just a matter of time,'' he said. `` We will produce a package,'' he vowed at another point. In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalled that Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> dismissed Cardinal <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> as the mediator in peace talks with the rebels. `` You know where <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> stands. Is n't it time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to have the courage to show where it stands?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked rhetorically. `` Now it's time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to show that it knows you ca n't have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships and the other has bandages,'' he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the defeat of the Contras would mean a `` grave strategic defeat for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The communists in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> understand this, the Soviets understand this _ it's time that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> understood it, too,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding, `` A Soviet base on the American mainland is a pistol pointed at the heart of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that the `` real issue'' before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not the Contras, `` it is communisim in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The president, who was warmly greeted by the audience of older veterans, told them of his recent trip to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, where he met with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. He asked their support for the ratification of the recently signed U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject further cuts in the nation's defense budget and allow for a strong alliance defense. `` This is not the time to drop our guard,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It's just this simple If we put Americans in harm's way, we owe them the best weapons money can buy.'' `` We'll need to keep up our strength if we're to succeed, and that's why the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must not further reduce the defense budget,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Offering a report on the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> meeting in his Saturday radio address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared that `` arms reduction is not enough'' in dealing with the Soviets and demanded they abandon the `` offensive strategy'' displayed against the Western alliance on the European continent. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said there was a `` lesson learned'' at the meeting, which was the first full-scale summit for the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in six years. `` One must always negotiate with the Soviets from a position of strength,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Following the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advance team traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to scout out possible sites for the fourth meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, planned for late May or early June. In his radio speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pointed out that while the allies praised the new U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove all medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they reaffirmed the need to remain united and keep their guard up. `` That's why continued modernization of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces _ nuclear and conventional _ is essential,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit that would end federal aid to religious schools abroad, primarily Jewish schools in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a prosecutor said Monday. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Southern District, said he filed papers in federal court Friday arguing that the case ought to be dropped because the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> does not have `` standing,'' a legal term which means the right to bring the lawsuit. But <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a staff attorney the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the civil liberties group maintains that it can pursue the lawsuit because the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> represents <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers whose money is used for the schools. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has until March 24 to respond. The lawsuit stemmed from reports last December that Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, had persuaded his colleagues to allocate $ 8 million to build schools in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for North African Jews. The program provoked a firestorm of criticism, prompting <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to rescind the money. Lawmakers agreed to <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>'s wish After President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the bill killing the $ 8 million program last month, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> amended its complaint to cover Jewish and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools that receive money under the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program, which is administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said lawyers learned about the program in the course of their research into the Inouye-supported item. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, claims that providing money to `` pervasively sectarian schools'' or for construction of sectarian schools is a violation of the Constitution's First Amendment calling for separation of church and state. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> asks the court to block further spending on the schools. Under the schools and hospitals program _ a favorite in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ grants are awarded to a non-profit American organization that sponsors an institution overseas. The program is designed to promote American educational methods abroad and train foreigners in medicine and promote American educational values. AID, which has regulations governing the program, awards the grants on a competitive basis. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is notified before the money is spent. The budget figures indicate how fond <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is of the program. In fiscal year 1988, AID asked for $ 10 million; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> increased the budget to $ 40 million. The previous fiscal year the program received $ 35 million. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is not challenging grants given to hospitals or non-sectarian schools abroad, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. But the group wants to end support for schools that have as a stated goal the teaching of principles and doctrines of Roman Catholicism and orthodox Judaism. AID documents for the four years ending in 1986 show that institutions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were given the most money, a total of $ 24.8 million. The lion's share _ $ 24 million _ went to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. Institutions in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> snagged the second largest amount of money, a total of $ 20.2 million. Project HOPE, which operates schools worldwide, received $ 14.3 million. All of the religious schools named in the lawsuit are in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Among the institutions which teach Judaism and have received money since fiscal 1983 are: <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belz </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, $ 500,000; <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chabad </LOCATION>, $ 750,000; <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Avat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, $ 100,000; <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, $ 1.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> Emunah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, $ 650,000; <ORGANIZATION> Gan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yavne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavne </PERSON>, $ 150,000; <ORGANIZATION> Machaniam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gat </LOCATION>, $ 400,000; <ORGANIZATION> Ohr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Somayach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, $ 2 million' Sha'Alvim Teachers' College, D.N. Agalon, $ 400,000. The lawsuit does not name any <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools for which it wants to eliminate money.

 Script writers struck movie and television producers today and the union predicted viewers of talk shows, game shows and daytime soaps would quickly notice a difference in programming. Hundreds of writers grabbed `` The Writers Guild Strikes'' placards depicting a quill and lightning bolt as mid-morning picket lines snaked in front of Twentieth Century Fox studios. The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> rejected a final offer presented Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> and called a walkout for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. The 600 <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> news writers are exempt from this action. The strike began here and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at 9 a.m. PST today. The contract expired at midnight Feb. 29. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said there would be no picketing in the East today. `` The longer the strike goes on, the more reruns the public will see,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> executive director and chief negotiator. `` It's a very tight ratings race and unfortunately for the networks it will impact them.'' Picket captain <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said selection of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> studio `` was fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and location had a lot to do with it. `` We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking around here,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'' writer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hixon </PERSON>, who marched with his 2-year old son, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, said writers were much more unified for this strike than in their last walkout in 1985. `` There was nearly a civil war last time between screen writers and television writers. But this time there's real solidarity,'' <PERSON> Hixon </PERSON> said. `` Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs relying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and the soaps will see a difference right away,'' said guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The strike slows down the production process and if prolonged, `` it finally comes to a halt,'' she said. A three-month strike delayed the fall television season three years ago. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said the network that would be hardest hit would be first-place <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, whose `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>,'' `` Saturday Night Live'' and `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' would be affected immediately. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, said nine soap operas on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and five in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also would be affected immediately, as would prime time miniseries, television movies and features in development or in production. But <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the alliance, which represents 200 producers and studios, said a strike was anticipated and scripts have been stockpiled. `` Shows like <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s show will go into reruns. But we will continue business,'' he said. Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some one-hour shows syndicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said they could n't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets. The median annual income for writers is $ 40,000 a year, but about half of the guild's members are unemployed at any given time, said <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The writers sought the first change in 17 years in how they are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets. They now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is negotiated between the writer and producer. The writers also demanded more artistic control on the final product. `` We had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short of giving them total control,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` The director is the captain of that creative team. We could n't bargain away rights that belonged to other guilds and unions.'' The producers had offered a $ 50 million package over a three-year period, including improvements in pension and health plans, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. In union ballots last week in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 96 percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached. The last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks. Since the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> won its first contract in 1947, script writers conducted strikes five times, more than any other entertainment industry union. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> bargained through the weekend with makers of TV and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerun payments for 100,000 actors. Members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent margin in recent votes, said <ORGANIZATION> SAG </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said today the administration welcomes `` the support and advice'' of 30 senators who argued in a letter to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be willing to give up control of occupied land in return for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. `` We are in the midst of an ongoing processs. The views of these senators are helpful to us and probably instructive to other parties in the region,'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. The 23 Democrats and seven Republicans, including several strong supporters of the Jewish state, also expressed support for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan to bring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and Palestinian Arabs to a peace conference by May 1 in an effort to stop violence in Israeli-occupied territory that has claimed some 80 Arab lives in three months The senators noted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has in the past supported the idea of `` land for peace'' by returning the Sinai peninsula to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. But they cited a statement by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that `` this expression of territory for peace is not accepted by me.'' `` We hope that the prime minister's statement did not indicate that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is abandoning a policy that offers the best hope for long-term peace,'' the letter said. `` The administration welcomes the support and advice from this group. They are senators of considerable stature and interest and involvment in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs,'' the spokesman said. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would respond to the letter. He declined to address the matter further, except to say that the administration prefers `` to maintain a certain discreet distance'' in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace process. But <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, in a comment that seemed to be directed at <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hopes for an `` early response'' from <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> governments to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to set up negotiations on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule by May 1. `` We believe all the parties understand and appreciate the reason that we've asked for these kind of responses,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Sunday blocked a decision by the Israeli Cabinet. He said he would permit a vote on the American initiative after he returns from talks here next week with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had demanded a Cabinet decision before <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to brief <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> later today on his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trips and he noted that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is to visit with the president on March 16. `` At the moment, we proceed on a pace that's fairly well structured and has been laid out by Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his shuttle diplomacy of the last several days,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said the administration was involved in a process `` that involves a blend of some new ideas and new beliefs,'' but he refused to comment further, saying, `` in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, it's more important not to say anything that prohibits the process or acts as a stoppage than to say anything that might stimulate activity.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, upon returning Saturday from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, expressed no criticism of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s position, saying the prime minister and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> agreed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annexation of territory could be a topic for negotiations <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have openly endorsed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposals, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have not. Strong supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> signing the letter included senators <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.

At the same time, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is considered an integral part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Nothing has changed on that,'' he said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would take up the situation with <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> during their talks. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have accused <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of harsh measures in putting down unrest in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Reports that reached <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Sunday said thousands of rioting Tibetans had set bonfires in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s streets and several people were killed during more than 12 hours of clashes with police. The protesters were demanding <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Police fired bullets and tear gas at protesters Saturday and three to nine people were killed, according to the unconfirmed reports from Western sources in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The administration, meanwhile, is dangling high-technology sales as an inducement for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to give firm assurances it will halt delivery of Silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The tradeoff _ and at least Chinese neutrality in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drive to impose an international arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ looms as the potential highlight of the talks <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> opened today. It is his first visit in four years, and the agenda is substantial. For instance, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will solicit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s support for his proposal for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is trying to structure a peace conference in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would serve as sponsors, but without the power to impose terms of a settlement. That calls for some delicate diplomacy. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is walking a tightrope between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the subject. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> refuses to negotiate unless he has Big Power support. But Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refuses to allow <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or the Soviets, who usually support Arab positions, to take an active role. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> arrived Sunday, had dinner with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and sees him and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> separately today. On Tuesday, the Chinese foreign minister calls on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House and meets with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> again. The shipping war in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is uppermost in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minds. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may be <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s largest arms supplier. Sales last year were worth an estimated $ 1 billion. The most dangerous of the weapons are Silkworm missiles _ short-range rockets that even in unskilled hands can wreak havoc on merchant ships. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used them effectively. Despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> persisted in delivering installments of the Silkworms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last year _ and denied what <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said it was doing. Frustrated, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated in October by suspending a decade-old process of liberalizing the types of high technology American companies could sell to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Since then, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said it has stopped selling Silkworms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity, said `` our information is that they've been living up to that.'' Still, before resuming liberalization of the high-technology trade, `` we want to be sure we're in sync with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> on what we're talking about,'' the official said. `` We want to be sure that this responsiveness will continue.'' On an arms embargo, meanwhile, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would like a commitment from Wu that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not veto a resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The sanctions would enforce a cease-fire resolution adopted last July that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> scorned. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts believe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would at least remain neutral if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed not to veto the resolution. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since July for support, but is not sure it has it yet.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is considering economic and trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including withholding monthly payments for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, but has not made any decisions yet, a White House spokesman said today. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said meetings will be held later this week to discuss options on how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can apply pressure to force the ouster of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. On March 15, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is due to pay $ 6.5 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a monthly payment toward the $ 75 million to $ 80 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes each year under the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> treaty. One of the options under consideration, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, is to put the money into an escrow account instead of paying it to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was right to put economic pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government, which <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> predicted would fall within 10 days `` We are grinding him down to a halt, and we should,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` I think we could have moved much faster,'' added <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, who is sponsoring a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a total trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We begin to see the incredible effects that we do have economically,'' the New York Republican said. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 12 local banks have been closed since Tuesday; branches of international institutions closed their doors Friday. The administration last week backed legal efforts to freeze <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, and authorities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were prevented from drawing on those accounts to keep the nation supplied with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, the official currency of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Calling the Panamanian strongman a terrorist and `` petty tyrant,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> asked: `` If we ca n't take <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on with the power that we have in the area economically, militarily, ... how are we going to deal with the drug lords of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and when are we really going to take on that war?'' `` This is an opportunity and time for us to strike a blow for democracy and to go after one of the drug lords in this hemisphere,'' he said. Questioned as to when he thinks <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be forced from power, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> replied, `` I would say within 10 days.'' Appearing with <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, the ambassador of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s deposed president, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, agreed with that prediction

 Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 12 Palestinians on Monday, and the army said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioters hurled a grenade for the first time since violence began in the occupied territories three months ago. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> defended the behavior of soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> it was the first time in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40-year history `` in which face-to-face, close, they see the ... hate of the rioters.'' Strikes and job boycotts extended to the administration of the territories. Palestinian employees of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> tax department were summoned to military headquarters Monday after 38 of the 40 workers said they were resigning. Inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas captured a commuter bus near <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION> and soldiers stormed the vehicle. Three Israelis and three guerrillas were killed. According to the army spokesman's office, soldiers shot and wounded seven Palestinians at <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION> after attackers threw a grenade at troopers who raided the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village to arrest `` rioters and inciters of rioting.'' The Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> put the number of wounded at eight. It was the first use of a grenade since Arab riots began Dec. 8. The first army report of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> gunfire in a demonstration occurred Sunday in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. No soldiers were injured. Israeli surveillance and restrictions make it difficult for Arabs to get firearms, and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has ordered protesters to avoid using guns. International sympathy has been created by images of well-armed soldiers shooting and beating youths armed only with rocks and homemade gasoline bombs in what Arabs call `` the uprising.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 83 Palestinians have been killed. At <LOCATION> Al-Ittihad </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Hamdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazlak </PERSON> said two Palestinians were treated for gunshot wounds suffered in clashes with troops at the nearby <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp. He said 20-25 others from <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Askar </PERSON> camp were treated for injuries caused by clubs, rubber bullets or tear gas, including a 4-year-old girl hit in the head by a rubber bullet. A 33-year-old Arab from <PERSON> Askar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Raouf </PERSON>, was dead on arrival at the hospital and <PERSON> Kazlak </PERSON> said his relatives attributed the death to tear gas. He said the cause of death was unclear, however, and noted the man suffered from heart disease. Army officials said they were investigating reports of the protests. Hospital officials in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said soldiers shot and wounded three Arabs during protests on the anniversary of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the strip soon after invading it in 1956 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Army spokesmen said soldiers opened fire when rubber bullets and tear gas did not disperse `` a violent demonstration in the Shati camp,'' wounding three Palestinians. The hospital officials, speaking anonymously, said more than 100 people were treated for beatings and injuries caused by tear gas and rubber bullets, most suffered at <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION>. Military authorities summoned employees of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> tax department to discuss a Sunday letter signed by 38 of the 40 workers saying they were resigning in response to a call by underground Palestinian leaders. A senior official said the Israelis explained the financial difficulties workers would face if they quit and `` the general situation in terms of public services that will be damaged.'' He said the workers had not yet resigned officially. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials claim <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> government workers in the territories have been threatened by Palestinian nationalists and Islamic militants.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been embarassed in space research since the Challenger disaster, and risks forfeiting its edge in high technology and other fields unless it expands space-based scientific missions, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official and researchers told a congressional hearing Monday. Further delays in projects already backed up three years plus a lack of funding for new space experiments will allow the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and European nations to cement the lead they have taken over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the Challenger explosion, said <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, associate administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lead that we had was allowed to erode and now we have to ask ourselves where we are going,'' said <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, who outlined the science-related portion of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed fiscal 1989 budget to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said 20 major science-related payloads are scheduled to be carried into space in the next four years, half of them aboard space shuttles and half on expendable rockets. The projects include probes to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Jupiter and the launching of an X-ray telescope, space telescope and gamma ray observatory designed to work in tandem to study a number of phenomena, including a supernova that occurred last year. The new X-ray telescope, the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, should also help researchers determine what the universe looked like up to 20 billion years ago and produce dramatic improvements in pharmaceuticals and computer chips, said Dr. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Tananbaum </PERSON> of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Resumption of the shuttle program and approval of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s science-related budget is vital to getting the 20 projects launched by 1993 and to prove to commercial businesses which pay to have satellites and experiments carried into space that the <LOCATION> Unites </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will re-establish itself as a dominant force in space, <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said He also urged researchers to develop new space-based experiments and technology so that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> can begin planning missions past 1993, when it is scheduled to complete current projects. `` We have a hiatus in space science launches today because of the Challenger tragedy,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. `` Let us not create another hiatus in the mid-1990s by failing to start major flight projects now.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., a subcommittee member who presided over the hearing, said a revitalized space program also was vital to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> businesses and universities, which received 846 contracts totaling $ 413 million in 1987 and have to date in 1988 been awarded 710 contracts totaling $ 388 million <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> and the academicians told the subcommittee that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> should not be pressured to curtail manned missions with civilian researchers because of the January 1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akin </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said that while computers and robots can greatly contribute to space research, their advancement should not be used to support calls for an end to manned space flights. `` Exploration is one of the last jobs which should be turned over to robots, as the curiosity for thirst and knowledge underlying the urge to explore is one of the finest attributes of being human,'' Akin said. `` Let us instead spend our efforts getting humans out of mine shafts and off high steel construction sites. Robots should totally replace man in the worst of jobs, not the best.''

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Holds Special Prayer Service for Tibet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, god-king of Tibetans, held a prayer service Monday in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to mourn weekend violence in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, hundreds of Tibetan refugees chanted `` We shall overcome'' in a demonstration solidarity with people in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Police prevented the crowd from marching on the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. A statement from the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> office said the trouble in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> `` is yet another indication of the depth of Tibetan people's resentment and opposition to Chinese rule.'' Hundreds of Tibetans attended the service in <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s exile headquarters in northern <LOCATION> Himachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, the statement said. It declared that the Tibetan issue `` can not be solved by use of force'' and called on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` to seriously negotiate for a solution.'' In a statement from <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> urged the Chinese to `` work toward a settlement which will benefit both the Tibetan and the Chinese peoples.'' He asked that Tibetans `` in the meantime ... refrain from violence in spite of repressive measures that the Chinese may take.'' Official reports in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said one policeman was killed and 28 were injured in the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> clash Saturday. Unconfirmed reports from Western sources put the toll at three to nine dead, including a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk and two Chinese policemen. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with about 100,000 of his followers in 1959, after an abortive Tibetan uprising. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an integral part of it for centuries, moved troops into the remote mountain region in 1950. Saturday's violence was the first in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> since Oct. 1, when 2,000 Tibetans led by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks set fire to a police station facing the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. Police opened fire and at least 14 people were reported killed. Many Tibetans resent the government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because of oppression of Tibetan religion and customs and destruction of temples during the 1966-76 radical Cultural Revolution. Although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has tried to redress past wrongs, friction remains between Tibetans and Chinese who continue to hold many senior posts in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The Tibetan government has refused nearly all requests by foreign journalists to visit <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and has restricted tourism since the disturbances last October.

 A prisoner handcuffed to a hospital bed broke the bed rail Monday and overpowered his police guard, then took the officer's gun and held two people hostage before giving up about six hours later. The prisoner freed the hostages, both hospital engineers, but continued to hold police off while threatening to shoot himself or fire into potentially explosive tanks of acetylene and oxygen in a subbasement of North General Hospital in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. `` He was rational but very upset,'' said Detective <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the chief negotiator. `` He had fits of depression and at one point put the gun to his head and at another point to his mouth.'' The prisoner, identified as <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 27, freed himself around 4:25 a.m. in his seventh-floor room at the hospital, where he had been taken for treatment of exposure after being arrested on kidnap charges early Saturday, officials said. Authorities were investigating how he broke his bed rail without alerting the guard, officer <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, in a hallway outside, said Chief of Patrol <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said. After getting <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>'s gun, the barefoot <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, wearing only a hospital gown and dragging a wedge-shaped section of aluminum-pipe bed rail from his wrist, made his way to the second floor, where he got the drop on a security guard, according to patients who saw the incident. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> allegedly took the guard's wallet, with $ 7, then forced him to break open a window leading onto a setback. Around this time <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> fired <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>'s .38 - caliber service revolver, Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said, but it was not known whether the discharge was accidental or <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had tried to hit No one was shot. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> made his way to the subbasement, where he burned his buttocks while clambering over a boiler, said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. He took his hostages, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadmus </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Nesconset </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kemail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajramoski </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, at the engineers' office, said police. One of the captives freed <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> from the bed rail by chiseling the handcuff chain. <PERSON> Cadmus </PERSON> was freed at 7:20 a.m. after police sent in some coffee and doughnuts, said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bajramoski </PERSON> was let go about an hour later when <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> agreed to stay with <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> in place of the hostage. `` He said he wanted to blow himself up but he did n't want to go alone,'' said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. Later, the officer saw the prisoner turn the gun on himself. `` He said to me, ` You want to see me do it? I'll do it right now,''' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> related. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as saying he had tried to escape because he feared going back into the criminal justice system. The prisoner was calmed by talking on the telephone to his father and sister and to an assistant district attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuzzi </PERSON>, who were brought to the hospital. Finally, he threw the gun out `` and walked out and took my hand,'' said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. Still barefoot, but with a red plaid shirt and a sheet over his gown, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was brought out at 10:45 a.m. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said he would be charged with robbery, reckless endangerment and weapon possession. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, 28, who was treated for cuts and bruises, had arrested <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> originally early Saturday after <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> allegedly used a starter's pistol to force a cabbie to drive him from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> fled the cab and jumped into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when the driver got the attention of police in eastern <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, authorities said. Harbor police fished him out and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> arrested him on charges of kidnap, menacing and gun and marijuana possession, police said. He had been taken to the hospital for treatment and observation.

 A Palestinian convicted in a terrorist attack on an Israeli jetliner lost out Monday in his bid to block the Canadian government's attempt to deport him. Federal court Justice <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> dismissed an application from <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>'s lawyers, who argued that the scheduled March 15 deportation hearing would violate <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The attorneys said that <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, 45, will not get a fair hearing because Immigration Minister <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> has already told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that `` the government will not rest before he -LRB- <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> -RRB- is out of the country.'' The judge said <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON>'s comments could have been more temperate. But he said the process `` also involves a sense of fairness to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'' and is necessary to assess `` who should come in and who should not.'' <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>'s lawyers, said he was filing an immediate appeal of the decision and a request for a stay in deportation proceedings until the appeal is heard. In 1970, a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> court convicted <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> of manslaughter for his part in a 1968 attack on an El Al airliner at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport that left one Israeli passenger dead. He served three months of his 17-year sentence and was released in a hostage exchange. He came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with his wife and three children a year ago and established a comfortable suburban life in <LOCATION> Brantford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. When reporters discovered his presence in the country in January, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> acknowledged having lied about his criminal record to gain entry to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But he said he renounced terrorism and avowed to live here peacefully. Some left-wing groups and newspaper columnists have been sympathetic to his case. However, his claim to have renounced <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorism long ago has been challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which claims <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> was involved in a 1986 plot to attack a Jewish settlement in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. In addition, the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Devoir </PERSON>, has reported the existence of an autobiographical book about <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> which depicts him as an active terrorist in 1975. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> has denied both allegations. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> tried to leave <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> quietly last month through a secret <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> operation. The plan called for him to fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and change planes for <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, possibly continuing on to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. Authorities have not clarified exactly what went wrong. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> but was put on a plane back to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Chain Store Heiress Wins Church Estate She Forced Into Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 An heiress who was awarded $ 6 million from a church she said exploited her won The Bible Speaks' 65-acre headquarters Monday with a $ 3.23 million bid at an auction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court. It was the second time that <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, had outbid others for the church's now-abandoned property, which includes 23 buildings. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had rejected her November bid of $ 1.8 million as too low. `` I'd be happy either way,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' husband, <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, after learning the couple's bid was the highest of the four sealed bids at the court hearing. The money Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> bid for the estate will go toward repaying the $ 6.6 million claim she won in federal <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last April against The Bible Speaks. She had sued the church for donations she made as a parishioner from 1982 to 1986, contending that she was lied to and that her unquestioning trust was exploited by church founder and leader Rev. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON> agreed in his ruling, calling the case `` an astonishing saga of clerical deceit, avarice and subjugation on the part of the church's founder. The ruling was upheld in January in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, but the church's lawyers have announced they intend to file an appeal. The dispute landed in federal <ORGANIZATION> Bankrupcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after the church obtained Chapter 11 protection, arguing that Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' case could forced it into insolvency. The claim by Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>, an heir to the <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> department store fortune, is by far the largest of the 250 creditors who are owed a total of $ 7 million by the church. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said he doubted she will ever receive all the money she won, although another piece of church property in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> recently sold for $ 1.1 million and a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> condominium and a mission ship are also up for sale by a court-appointed trustee. `` I hope we even get $ 4 million,'' the attorney said. `` The question is, where did all that money go? We're going to look into that question.'' The Bible Speaks had claimed 1,200 members worldwide until the ministry disbanded last summer, saying it would never operate under the control of a court-appointed trustee. The trustee, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON>, had been apppointed by the bankrutpcy court to manage the estate until Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' claim could be paid. Most of the church's 20 pastors followed <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, although a few remained behind to set up another church in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>. The church's <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> estate had been valued at $ 6 million, but investors said town zoning restrictions made it difficult to develop the land. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> said Monday he and his wife planned to sell some of the church property to developers and turn some of it into a school and a community center for the wealthy town, the summer home of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal judge on Monday dismissed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 35 million libel suit against a former congressman, who said the court's action unmasked <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> `` as the fraud he is.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, complaining he could not campaign and pursue the suit at the same time, had asked for the dismissal. He called Monday's action `` a real victory. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> formally ended the suit against former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Calif., who had questioned <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s Korean War record, after <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> agreed to pay court costs <PERSON> Green </PERSON> signed a brief order dismissing the case `` with prejudice,'' which means that <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> is legally the victor in the dispute. `` This is a confirmation of my integrity,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I do n't like at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He is admitting that he is the one who is the liar.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> accepted the court-costs condition in a one-sentence letter from his attorney, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON>, that was delivered to the judge's chambers by messenger. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said, `` The court's service was to unmask this man as the fraud he is.'' But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the judge `` gave me what I consider a real victory.'' `` She denied him any court costs _ any damages, I should say. He asked for $ 400,000. And I have the privilege of suing him once the primary is over,'' he said. However, in an opinion issued last week, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> quoted _ and underlined _ a passage from a 1985 federal appeals court opinion that stated: `` Dismissal of an action with prejudice is a complete adjudication of the issues presented by the pleadings and is a bar to further action between the parties.'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> said he understood that this citation means his client can not be sued again over any statements he makes about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s war record. `` It's an absolute dead letter,'' <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> said. `` I assume he can bring suit if <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> says something else, but not about this whole Korean business.'' Under terms of the dismissal, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> must pay court fees, printing costs and court reporters' fees, but not <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s attorney's fees, estimated at $ 400,000 The judge gave <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyers 20 days to file an itemized list of court costs to be assessed against <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Those costs could range between $ 5,000 and $ 20,000, depending on conflicting estimates given by lawyers for both sides. If <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had rejected <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s dismissal, he would have had to go to court on Tuesday to begin the trial, which was expected to last about three weeks. `` The judge gave me an impossible dilemma,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said on Sunday, `` the choice of either defending my honor on Tuesday or being president and running for president.'' The suit stems from <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s allegation that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> used the political influence of his late father, Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, D-Va., to avoid combat in the Korean War The former television evangelist filed the lawsuit in 1986. Several former Marines later came forward to support <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s allegation <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said Monday he is setting up a legal defense fund hoping to raise money to pay for the attorneys' fees.

 The new president of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said Monday she empathizes with students and faculty at the all-deaf university who are protesting her appointment because she hears. `` I do feel very deeply a sense of compassion and empathy,'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview. `` I know it's hurting them because they very much wanted their seventh president to be deaf. `` But I think that what the students are expressing in general is their deep concern and care for the university.

Hundreds of students shut down <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only university for the deaf, out of anger Monday over the selection of a president who is not hearing-impaired. <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> said she would probably begin her new job this summer. Meanwhile, she will begin an intensive program to learn sign language and hopes to volunteer with agencies that work with the deaf, she said. <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, vice chancellor of Academic Affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> since 1983, was named <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> president Sunday by the school's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> said she was concerned about the student protests but not about what impact it might have on her presidency. `` I think it would be inhuman on my part not to be concerned,'' she said. `` But my concern is for the pain that I know some individuals are feeling. I do, however, believe that the board has made its decision.'' `` The university belongs to a large and varied constitutency of which the president is a symbol,'' she said. `` I am not, perhaps to some, the best symbol. `` I know that I can not fully understand the experience of deafness without being deaf. ... But I will become as knowledgable and as understanding and as empathetic as anyone can who's a hearing person.'' <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> holds a doctorate in educational psychology from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>.

 The Soviet ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Monday urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to stop bombarding each other's capitals and said the escalating `` war of the cities'' was a major development in the war. `` We think that the war between cities adds some new dimension to the protracted military conflict between the two neighboring countries,'' Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> made his statements in an unusual news conference outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which later met behind closed doors on the Iran-Iraq conflict. Last July, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> demanded an immediate cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now pushing for an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for rebuffing the resolution, but the Soviets have balked at an embargo. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said he met Monday with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and with the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> this month, Yugoslav Ambassador <PERSON> Dragoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pejic </PERSON>, and urged them `` in the most energetic terms'' to try to persuade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to stop the missile attacks. `` It is difficult to say what political and psychological consequences the war of the cities may result in,'' <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said. `` The position of my country is clear. We are for the soonest possible political resolution of the conflict between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and for the speediest possible implementation of the'' cease-fire resolution. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> was also asked whether his country believes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now accepts the cease-fire resolution, as it seemed to claim in an ambiguous unsigned note to the council last week. `` We do n't think that it would be right just to disregard the new developments in the situation,'' he said, refusing to elaborate. The unsigned note from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed that a Feb. 28 letter from its foreign minister constituted acceptance of the resolution. The letter, however, did not say that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> endorsed the resolution. British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> on Monday called the letter `` an undated, unsigned scrap of paper.'' `` Where does that leave us?'' he said. `` It does not constitute a clear acceptance.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't accept the unsigned note either and will keep pushing for an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

The Soviets are close allies of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> but have also been trying to improve relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are believed to be using Soviet-made missiles in the `` war of the cities.'' <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> denied that what he called `` the defensive weapons now used against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other cities'' are Soviet-made.

 Hundreds of experts from around the globe gather in antebellum <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> this week to seek ways to make the world's cities better places to live. The 4th International Conference on Making Cities Liveable, which opens Wednesday, is being held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time. `` The quality of life in our cities has become increasingly a national concern,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> boasts many `` important national, if not international, examples of the liveability of cities,'' from its preservation efforts to its innovative programs of low-income housing to the acclaimed <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> arts festival. `` But we have so much to learn,'' he said. `` It's a conference for people who are concerned about the quality of life in the city'' but is n't a professional conference, said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON>, one of the organizers and a founder of the Center for Urban Well-Being. `` It brings together many different kinds of people. It brings together city planners and architects, city council presidents and mayors and citizens who are simply concerned about making their cities more liveable,'' she said. More than 300 people are expected to attend and more than 100 people are scheduled to speak. Among the topics of discussion will be the design of public spaces, festivals, the role of markets in the city and a number of case studies. The Center for Urban Well-Being, based in <LOCATION> Southhampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is a partnership that conducts research, publishes and works with cities on urban issues. The first three international conferences were held in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. `` We wanted to bring it to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to make it more accessible for Americans,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> said. One of the topics of discussion will be public art _ sculptures and other art in public places such as parks. Sculptor <PERSON> Bonifatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirnberg </PERSON>, who has crafted numerous, whimsical, human-sized sculptures for parks and fountains throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, will talk about his craft. Usually crafted of bronze, his works are often designed for a particular town and tell something about its history or folklore. They include a sculpture of carnival characters on a barge that's part of a fountain and a long bronze sea serpent whose tail serves as a park bench <PERSON> Stirnberg </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said through an interpreter, `` The goal of my work is to make sculpture that is loved by the people _ that people can move and touch.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said, `` in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we see so much public art that is not of a human scale.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said `` the power of a meeting like this is in the learning, teaching and sharing. It has the potential of improving the quality of life in cities all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and beyond.''

 No order is too tall for Richlee Shoes, which specializes in elevator shoes. It even sells elevator bedroom slippers. `` If you're going to be taller at the office and the company picnic, why would n't you want to be taller at home? Wo n't the neighbors notice if you run out to get the paper that you're shorter? said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who operates the company with his sister and three brothers. Ninety styles, priced $ 40 to $ 120, are displayed in 100,000 square feet of warehouse space just south of <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>. It sells direct and through mail order. `` We do n't feel we've even scratched the surface'' of the number of men who want to appear taller, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` Depending on the style, our shoes can make a man two inches taller. I've had people call me up ... they say ` the difference in my height has made a difference in my social life.''' Elevator shoes have come a long way from the days when the company's celebrity spokesman, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, sported oxfords with chunky heels that did n't hide their purpose. Today's elevator shoes look like normal shoes but have a built-up insole. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he even has one regular customer who stands 6-foot-5. `` I asked him why,'' he said. `` He said he was a basketball player in college and all his friends were 6-feet-7 or 8.''

At <ORGANIZATION> Dommerich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> suburb, fifth-graders are brainstorming their way to new ideas to resolve problems, such as locating a dog at night or taking out the garbage.

Besides opening up the innovative process, <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> says, the program enhances students' self-esteem. One Ocoee second-grader who was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented a device that earned him his classmates' admiration. `` Suddenly he became a famous inventor.

 The sex experts Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Monday they could not provide scientific evidence to support their widely publicized claim that AIDS is `` running rampant'' among heterosexuals. When Masters was asked at a contentious news conference how he could justify such a claim, he said, `` I simply believe this.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, asked the same question, said `` I'm not sure we chose the word ` rampant' ourselves.'' On page seven of their new book, they write: `` The AIDS virus is now running rampant in the heterosexual community.'' The book, `` Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior in the Age of AIDS,'' was made available to reporters Monday morning. The first reports of its contents appeared in connection with an excerpt from the book published in this week's Newsweek magazine. `` We do n't see an explosion into the heterosexual community,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischinger </PERSON>, AIDS coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This does not mean we can be complacent about it.'' He noted that nationwide screening of blood donors has found that only about one in 40,000 has the potential of being infected with the AIDS virus. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been working very hard to try to get the best sense of prevalence of HIV infection in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Fischinger said. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s health commissioner, said of the Masters and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> study, `` All in all, I think it's greatly overblown.'' He criticized them for not submitting their data to a scientific journal where it could be reviewed in detail by other researchers, and he said their data did not support the sweeping claims they made. `` I think everyone would agree there is a serious danger in heterosexual transmission,'' he said. But `` contrary to what they say, I think the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> people have been saying that for a long time.'' Masters and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON>, their co-author and a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Masters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, studied 800 men and women in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The study, the centerpiece of their book, included only people who said they did not use illicit intravenous drugs and said they had had no homosexual or bisexual contact and no blood transfusions since 1977. Masters, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> chose four hundred men and women who said they had had at least six sexual partners each year for the preceding five years, and another 400 who said they had been monogamous. The researchers found that 5 percent of the sexually active men and 7 percent of the sexually active women had antibodies to the AIDS virus, meaning they had been exposed to it. The researchers said, however, that these findings could not be used to project how many people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might be infected with the AIDS virus. `` This is not meant to be _ it was not constructed as _ a broad representative sample of the population,'' said <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kolodny </PERSON> said the claim that AIDS is rampant among heterosexuals comes from studies by other researchers. But other studies have diverged widely on the question of how rapidly AIDS is entering the non-drug-using heterosexual community. In October, for example, Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> studied men and women visiting a sexually transmitted-diseases clinic in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and found that one-third of the men infected with the AIDS virus and almost half of the women got the infection through heterosexual contact. That was one of the highest reported rates of spread among heterosexuals. At the same scientific meeting, however, researchers from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that only one in 205 men coming to a sexually transmitted-diseases clinic in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was infected with AIDS in the absence of drug use, homosexuality or other high-risk behavior.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, anticipating a Super Tuesday windfall of Republican convention delegates, is targeting <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the biggest state in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> base, as the battleground that could end the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's hope of a comeback in the GOP race. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> does if he does n't win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` I ca n't wait to hear their new theory if they lose <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Everyone comes up with a theory on how they can still win it.'' A <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign source agreed the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator must win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and said they would spend about $ 500,000 on television advertising, their largest budget for any state. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager, refused to cite a specific figure for the campaign's advertising budget but said they would spent `` whatever it takes.'' Traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he expected the vice president to win 12 or 13 of the 17 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> events on Tuesday. Asked he was hoping for a clean sweep, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` You always wish for that, but I certainly would never predict that. It's too much for anyone to expect.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides speculate about a possible Super Tuesday sweep that could net the vice president up to 600 GOP convention delegates, the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> camp talks about surviving the South and getting back to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator has whipped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is undefeated in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign aide <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` The key is how well we do in the Midwestern tier of states, starting with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s pollster. But <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> disputed the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> homeground advantage in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` The votes are n't in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s backyard,'' he said. `` The votes are in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the collar counties -LRB- the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs -RRB- and it's hardly a typical farm state.'' With 82 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates at stake, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary is March 15, one week after Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has already started his television campaign in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> with a biographical ad that emphasizes his humble upbringing, war service, and leadership role in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> turned <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vision into an action plan for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said the ad, which concluded with the narrator saying, `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is a strong man _ with a record of solving tough problems.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a strong organization in the state, headed by <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and augmented by former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>. Backing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, as well as 93 of the state's 102 Republican county chairmen. While the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign cited <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as the staging ground for a comeback, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides called the state important but not essential. `` If for some reason <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, I still suspect he's going to be the nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aide cited the key role the state has played in past presidential nomination races. `` In my mind, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was going to be the nominee when we won <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in 1980,'' he said. `` In my mind when <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in 1984, he was going to be the nominee.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> contended that the election calendar also is a problem for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. They cited the fact that among the key states that follow <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a big advantage, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the vice president is the only candidate to have delegate slates filed in every congressional district. `` We get 45 delegates just for showing up,'' said <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. `` Even winning a state or two,'' added <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, `` I do n't see how he -LRB- Dole -RRB- gets the upper hand. ... Can he win a state or two? Sure. Can he stop <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>? I do n't think so.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> renewed his call Monday for weapons for the rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> gave the request an icy reception. In a speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his congressional opponents on the issue of aid to the Contra rebels lack courage to fight communism, and said efforts to renew `` humanitarian'' aid for the rebels are insufficient. `` Now it's time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to show that it knows you ca n't have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships and the other has bandages,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the group <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said later that the administration still hopes <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will come up with a new Contra aid proposal and that the White House will be encouraging efforts in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to write an aid bill. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that `` time is a problem. ... We do n't know how long -LRB- the Contras -RRB- can last. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels ended a week ago. But on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week narrowly defeated an effort to send food and clothing to the Contras, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said it is time to turn to other issues. `` There is a weariness with the Contra issue'' among House members, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. He added that he plans to begin mapping out a program of other legislation to bring to the floor, including issues like welfare reform and a health-care bill. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also signaled that a group of senators trying to revive some kind of Contra aid bill could run into procedural roadblocks, reminding reporters obliquely that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> traditionally reserves the right to originate any legislation to appropriate money. `` I'm not looking for problems'' with a Senate-originated bill, he said, but added: `` Those who draft the legislation ought to be mindful of that.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said last week's defeat of the Democratic $ 30.8 million Contra aid package means that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is left with little more than moral suasion as a tool to influence Central American peace efforts. `` It just throws it into the hands of the Central Americans entirely, and sort of withdraws the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the moment from having any direct influence,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he has sent telegrams to both sides in the conflict, urging them to pursue a cease-fire agreement when they meet this week for the first time without a mediator and inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said he urged the Sandinista side to permit a role for Nicaraguan Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, whom Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has rejected as a mediator after several fruitless sessions. And he asked the rebels to go forward with the talks, noting that they had been granted the high-level direct talks they have been seeking. In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the defeat of the Contras would mean a `` grave strategic defeat for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The communists in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> understand this, the Soviets understand this _ it's time that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> understood it too,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` A Soviet base on the American mainland is a pistol pointed at the heart of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that the `` real issue'' before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not the Contras, `` it is communism in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Referring to last week's 216-to-208 vote, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Courage has n't exactly been the watchword of some opponents of Contra aid. ... Last week, aid opponents tried to pass the buck of responsibility for abandoning in the field the young men and women of the Democratic resistance, and that ploy failed as it should have.''

<HEAD>Court To Decide Case On Disqualifying Black Potential Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will decide whether a criminal defendant's right to a jury selected from a cross-section of the community is violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors because they are black. The court will review the case of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> supermarket and for the attempted murder of police officers shot at after the robbery. The justices in 1986 ruled in a case called <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> that prosecutors never may disqualify potential jurors based on their race. The court said such tactics violate equal-protection rights. But a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive effect of the <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> ruling. The court said the <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> decision does not apply to convicted criminals who, like <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, had exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to April 30, 1986, when <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> was announced. If the justices were to rule that the prosecutorial tactics used at <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>'s trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to cross-sectional jury selection, he would be entitled to a new trial even though the <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> ruling came too late to help him. Presumably, such a ruling would affect other prison inmates' convictions as well The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last May that past <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions make clear that `` the fair cross-section requirement of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the jury itself'' but only to the pool of potential jurors from which juries are chosen. Lawyers for <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, who is black, contend that his fair-trial rights were violated when prosecutors used all 10 of their so-called peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury. The court's decision is not expected until sometime in 1989.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would welcome participation by North Korean athletes in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said Monday. `` The Olympics would be better off if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> chooses to participate,'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. `` But time is running out.'' He added that `` we have nothing but a positive attitude'' toward participation by <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have `` some additional naval units'' in the region at the time of the September Olympic Games. Speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, he said the additional naval presence was `` a very timely, practical coincidence.'' Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the additional presence will probably consist of one or two aircraft carriers. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> warned that any attempt by the North Koreans to disrupt the games `` would make them a total pariah.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of only a handful of countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which is boycotting the games. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> indicated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ask visiting Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> to use his country's leverage with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to prevent any disruption of the Olympics. `` This is the logical, diplomatic way to proceed'' with the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government, he said. `` We have no leverage with them, and any suggestion on our part would be counterproductive.''

<HEAD>January Marks Biggest Debt Increase In Four Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 5.42 billion more in installment debt than they paid off in January, the biggest monthly increase in four months and the second strong month in a row, the government said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said consumer credit grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.6 percent in January, following an increase of $ 3.98 billion in December, which translated to an annual rate of 7.9 percent. Growth in both months was greater than the 5.9 percent rate for all of 1987, which represents a considerable slowdown compared with recent years. The rate was 10.5 percent in 1986. The relatively strong January report is both a reflection of job growth _ unemployment hit a nine-year low of 5.7 percent in February _ and a sign that the rebound in consumer confidence after the October stock market crash is continuing, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` What we're seeing right now ... is a sort of soft landing for consumer spending,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, whose firm is predicting growth between 6.5 percent and 7 percent this year. `` We're not really looking for a recession to occur, if anything just a bit of slowness in the first half of the year.'' The January increase was the biggest advance since debt rose by $ 6.43 billion in September. The gains in both months were strongly influenced by an upturn in car sales. Auto loans rose by $ 1.54 billion in January, an annual rate of 7.1 percent, and followed a stronger gain of 10.7 percent in December. Credit card and revolving loans grew by $ 2.0 billion in January, a 16.5 percent annual rate, following an increase of 19.3 percent a month earlier. The debt category which includes bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate grew by $ 1.73 billion, an 11.6 percent growth rate, following a decline of 3.5 percent in December. Loans for mobile homes increased $ 142 million after falling $ 122 million in December. The various changes left total consumer debt at $ 617.5 billion in January.

 Rescuers using trained dogs found the body of a cross-country skier buried in an avalanche in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a park spokesman said Monday. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, was buried Sunday afternoon in the Plummer Peak area, 5,000 to 6,000 feet in elevation, spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Uberuaga </PERSON> said. Her companion, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, told rangers he probed unsuccessfully in the snow for about an hour before skiing out and notifying park rangers, <PERSON> Uberuaga </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mehan </PERSON>, with two rangers and two climbers, tried to get to the site late Sunday, but had to turn back because of darkness and avalanche hazard, <PERSON> Uberuaga </PERSON> said. On Monday, a team of 11 park staff, 10 members of the area mountain-rescue council and three dog units began probing the avalanche, <PERSON> Uberuaga </PERSON> said. An initial shoulder-to-shoulder sweep of the avalanche failed to fine Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, he said. A dog that sensed a `` hot spot'' found the body buried near the base of the avalanche, <PERSON> Uberuaga </PERSON> said. Rescuers used probes to pinpoint the body and dig it out. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had been missing about 20 hours. The avalanche, about 60 feet wide and 120 feet long, ranged in depth from 2 feet to 10 feet, <PERSON> Uberuaga </PERSON> said. A high avalanche hazard was posted all day Sunday, after <PERSON> Paradise </PERSON> received 10 inches of snow Saturday, bringing the total there to 130 inches. Avalanche hazard was still considered high on Monday.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of corn would be about 11.8 million bushels. Corn prices recently have been averaging about $ 1.85 per bushel at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around $ 22 million. The corn is part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 3.17 million tons of corn, plus almost 6.9 million tons of wheat; 813,300 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>Security Council Draft Calls For Economic Sanctions Against South

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> draft resolution circulated Monday calls for mandatory economic sanctions, including an oil embargo, against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to force the government to abolish apartheid within a year. The draft resolution, to be discussed when the council meets Tuesday, expresses outrage at the banning of anti-apartheid activities and concern for the `` worsening of the human suffering resulting from the apartheid system'' of racial segregation. The resolution says <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s intransigence `` compels the international community to impose, as a first step, selective mandatory sanctions.'' Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and districts. The resolution, circulated after three days of debate, calls for a halt to export and sale of oil to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; an end to further investment and loans; a ban on imports of iron and steel; a halt of all trade promotion and support for trade; prohibition of sale of <LOCATION> Kruggerands </LOCATION> and all coins minted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; and cessation of all forms of military, policy or intelligence cooperation, especially the sale of computer equipment. South African U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, `` We will not bow to your threats or demands and we reject your accusations with contempt and invite you to do your damnedest.'' The resolution calls for all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members to back the sanctions and report progress to the secretary-general. It establishes a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> committee to monitor implementation. Security Council resolutions can be vetoed by any one of its permanent members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Council and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> have condemned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the past, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have opposed sanctions. The resolution says the sanctions would remain in force for one year, after which the council again will meet to determine if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has abolished apartheid. The proposed measures also require <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to lift the ban on anti-apartheid political activities, release all political prisoners, allow the free and safe return of exiles and commence dialogue with leaders of the majority black population. The draft resolution was submitted by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>High Court To Rule Whether Stereotyping Denied Woman Partnership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday set the stage for an important ruling on sex discrimination, agreeing to study a case in which `` unconscious stereotyping'' allegedly played a key role in denying a woman an accounting firm partnership. The justices said they will review a ruling that places a heavy burden on employers to disprove sex bias. Arguments in the case will be heard in the fall during the court's next term and a decision is not likely to be announced until 1989. Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, is accused of discriminating unlawfully against <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. She quit the firm's office here after she was denied promotion to partnership, a move that would have made her a part owner. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> joined the firm in 1978 and was nominated for partnership in 1982, the only woman among 88 candidates for partnership that year. She had been very successful in getting business for the company, winning government contracts worth an estimated $ 34 million to $ 44 million. Of the 88 candidates, 47 were invited to become partners; 21 were rejected outright; and 20 including Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> were placed on hold. The following year she was told she would not become a partner, and she resigned in 1984 to set up her own consulting firm. Both her critics and supporters at Price Waterhouse said she sometimes was overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her staff and very demanding. One critic suggested she needed to take a `` course at charm school.'' A partner in the firm who urged her promotion told her she would stand a better chance of becoming a partner if she would `` walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.'' Others said her use of profanity was a black mark against her. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> then sued Price Waterhouse, accusing the company of violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting on-the-job sex disscrimination. She said that sex stereotyping, unconscious or otherwise, barred her from being named partner. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1984, in the case of a woman denied partnership in a law firm, that professional partnerships are covered by the 1964 law. A federal judge ruled Price Waterhouse must prove `` by clear and convincing evidence'' it would not have made her a partner regardless of whether sexual stereotyping played a part in its decision. Price Waterhouse said it was unable to provide such proof. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here last August said there is `` competent evidence that ... the partnership selection process at Price Waterhouse was impermissibly infected by stereotypical attitudes toward female candidates.'' The appeals court said even if there is evidence that Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' personality played a part in her denial of partnership, Price Waterhouse is unable to prove `` impermissible bias was not the determinative factor.'' The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what back pay and other remedies the company must provide. The case is Price Waterhouse vs. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, 87-1167.

 President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was quoted Monday as saying he's certain of signing an Afghan peace accord soon, even though his representative continued to press for an interim government to oversee withdrawal of Soviet troops. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief representative in the peace talks, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> was still hoping for Soviet cooperation, even though his country wants an interim government to replace the present Moscow-backed regime. `` It is in their interest, too, to see that there is peace and calm after they leave,'' said <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> after talks resumed Monday morning following a weekend recess. However, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was quoted as telling the Gulf News, a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> newspaper, that `` there is no question of the accord not going through.'' `` Allowing it to be dropped is no option,'' he said. The talks adjourned so Pakistani government and opposition leaders could discuss whether they're ready to sign an accord with the Soviet-backed Afghan government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> represents Afghan rebels in the talks and does not recognize the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> declined to say what <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had decided over the weekend. No afternoon session was scheduled following the morning meetings conducted separately by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> with the Afghan and Pakistani delegations. Asked whether there was any progress, Afghan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said only, `` Ask Mr. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has named March 15 as the deadline for signing a settlement if the pullout of 115,000 Soviet troops is to begin in mid-May, before a U.S.-Soviet summit. Agreement was reached Thursday on a withdrawal over nine months in which half of the troops would leave within 90 days. A spokesman for the largest group in the seven-party Afghan rebel alliance said Monday that progress was being made in setting up an Islamic government with headquarters possibly in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Professor <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kariab </PERSON>, in charge of political affairs of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-I-Islami </ORGANIZATION> party, said a U.S-educated engineer, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, had already been unanimously elected head of state. <PERSON> Kariab </PERSON> also told reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that the alliance was already in contact with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other countries regarding possible recognition of the future government. The alliance claims to represent 200,000 rebels and to control 80 percent of the Afghan territory. <PERSON> Kariab </PERSON> also repeated charges raised by the chairman of his party, <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had struck a `` secret deal'' to prevent formation of such a government. He said a `` Jewish lobby'' was part of such `` conspiracy'' because it feared Islamic fundamentalism. He said that if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were pressed to sign `` a settlement in the present shape, -LRB- it -RRB- will be historic treason to the Afghan people.''

<HEAD>Better Air Campaign Exceeded Goals; Oxy Fuels Program Right On
Target</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Metropolitan area residents exceeded the goals set by the Better Air Campaign in reducing traffic volume and wood smoke on high pollution days and met the oxygenated fuel program's goals, officials announced Monday Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> reported the results of the 90-day Better Air Campaign and the two-month oxygenated fuels program at a news conference. `` The people of this area are to be congratulated,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` By reducing their driving between November and January and by restricting wood burning on high-pollution days, they have reduced carbon monoxide pollution in the metro area by up to 17 percent.'' The campaign's purpose was to reduce traffic volume and wood-smoke pollution on days when temperature inversions caused <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s carbon-monoxide levels to soar. The project achieved a 9 percent reduction in traffic on high-pollution days, equivalent to three million miles daily, and a 10 percent reduction in carbon monoxide vehicle emissions, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION>'s Air Pollution Control Division. She said the program's goal was an 8 percent traffic reduction and a 9 percent reduction in carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emissions from wood-burning fell 7 percent on high-pollution days during the most recent Better Air Campaign, said <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, and the goal was a 6 percent reduction. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said the 7 percent carbon monoxide reduction attributable to observance of wood-burning bans was more than double last year's results The Better Air Campaign ran from early November until the end of January. In its previous three years, it ran for just 60 days. The oxygenated fuels program, which was launched for the first time in January and lasted two months, required all service stations along the 130-mile corridor along the <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> between <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> to sell only oxygenated fuels, or fuels containing at least 1.5 percent oxygen. The program's purpose was to provide a gasoline that would burn cleaner in car engines and thus contribute less carbon monoxide pollution, officials said. Motorists were offered the choice of an ether-gasoline blend, or gasohol, which contains ethyl alcohol. <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said the oxy fuels program was right on target in its goal of reducing ambient carbon-monoxide levels by 8 percent to 10 percent. The reduction was in the 8 percent to 9.5 percent range, she said.

Both students were Cuban-Americans from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, both were studying medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> Universidad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Este </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, but they did not know each other. The body of <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereda </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, dumped near a sugar cane field two days after he was kidnapped, had been beaten so badly that only a birthmark on the back of one hand permitted his identification, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday, quoting the victim's family. His abduction came just three weeks before he was scheduled to graduate from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> medical school on Feb. 12. Police, stumped for a motive, began looking into an earlier incident involving another Cuban-American student at the University. Shortly before the killing, student <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotolongo </PERSON> had a run-in with a jealous husband, who fired his gun but hit no one, The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. The two young men resembled each other and <PERSON> Pereda </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, was known by a nickname similar to <LOCATION> Sotolongo </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Bobolongo </LOCATION>. `` We believe the murder could have been a mistake,'' said First Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macoris </LOCATION>, a town about 40 miles east of the capital of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, where the body was found. <PERSON> Sotolongo </PERSON> has returned to his home in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think he is in any danger, he is here with me,'' <PERSON> Sotolongo </PERSON>'s father told The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is sorry for the other boy. He does n't know if they killed him by mistake or if they wanted to kill him.'' <PERSON> Pereda </PERSON>'s murder devastated his parents, who have no other children, and friends. `` He did n't smoke, or drink or fool around. He was very educated, an old-fashioned person,'' said his classmate and girlfriend, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` No drugs, no alcohol, no women. There are very few men like him nowadays.'' One aunt, <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, said she wants to go to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. `` We want answers,'' she said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would welcome participation by North Korean athletes in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said Monday. `` The Olympics would be better off if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> chooses to participate,'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. `` But time is running out.'' He added that `` we have nothing but a positive attitude'' toward participation by <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have `` some additional naval units'' in the region at the time of the September Olympic Games. Speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, he said the additional naval presence was `` a very timely, practical coincidence.'' Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the additional presence will probably consist of one or two aircraft carriers. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> warned that any attempt by the North Koreans to disrupt the games `` would make them a total pariah.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of only a handful of countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which is boycotting the games. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> indicated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ask visiting Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> to use his country's leverage with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to prevent any disruption of the Olympics. `` This is the logical, diplomatic way to proceed'' with the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government, he said. `` We have no leverage with them, and any suggestion on our part would be counterproductive.''

 The first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor egg produced by captive breeding is fertile and contains the makings of a chick, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park officials said Monday. `` You ca n't actually see an embryo yet, but what you can see is the beginnings of circulatory development, which appears as a dark dime-sized dot toward the top of the yolk,'' park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON> said. The egg was laid Thursday, the product of a male condor known as AC-4 and a female condor called UN-1. It was removed immediately from its nest in the park's `` condorminium'' and placed in an incubator. Keepers peeked inside the egg by holding it up to a high-intensity lamp in a process known as `` candling.'' The egg then was returned to its incubator, where it will be kept until the hatching expected between April 28 and May 3, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Now, we incubate the egg according to the parameters that have worked so well in the past and hope ... we can hatch a healthy condor chick,'' he said. All 27 living <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors are in captivity. Fourteen are kept at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. Thirteen of the 27 birds were hatched in captivity in an effort to build a breeding flock to save the rare birds from extinction. Each of those eggs were taken from nests in the wild. The breeding program has been conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliate, the Wild Animal Park, since 1983 in cooperation with state and federal wildlife officials. The last known wild condor was captured in April 1987 by government biologists after it was determined the carrion-eating birds' existence was threatened by lead poisoning in their food supply and human encroachment upon their central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> habitat. `` Our success or failure has pivoted on the captive production of a fertile egg and that's what we've got,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said of the 4-day-old egg. Meanwhile, the parents of the egg were said to be doing well. Keepers removed the shell from its nest soon after it was laid to stimulate more breeding activity by the pair, which <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said has begun. `` That's real positive,'' he said. `` That would lead us to hope for the production of a second egg, which could come as early as 30 days after the first egg. `` The parents are doing fine, the egg is doing fine and the keepers are doing fine.''

<HEAD>Number Of Serious Crimes Rise By 6.3 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 1 million serious crimes were reported in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last year, a record number blamed in part on the spread of `` crack'' cocaine and other drugs, authorities announced Monday. The number of reported homicides, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle thefts rose 6.3 percent to go over the 1 million mark for the first time, to 1,021,283, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. `` As you know, the crime rate is driven to a large extent by the drug problem. There is no question about that,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said. He urged Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to consider increasing spending for criminal justice. Presently, he said, 6 percent of an $ 18.5 billion budget is devoted to the criminal justice system, which includes law enforcement and the courts, he said. `` It's intolerable. We need to do something about addressing credibility in the criminal justice area,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said. `` We need to address the career criminals, the jail situation and some of the weaknesses in the so-called criminal justice system, which as many of you know is no system at all.'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> also said citizens need to start a grassroots campaign to help prevent violence and property thefts. Increases in property crime, particularly in some of the more rural counties, can be directly attributed to the increase of the powerful crack form of cocaine, the commissioner said. `` Anybody who tells you the drug problem is leveling off is in fairyland. They do n't know what's happening,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> figures released Monday were preliminary. A complete report was expected to be issued later this year. The commissioner said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> continues to lead other states in crime rates, or the number of crimes reported per 100,000 population. He compared <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 1987 figures with figures reported by other states in 1986. `` We have the highest crime rate in the nation,'' said <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>. Department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s per-capita crime rate, which increased by 2.9 percent in 1987, has been significantly higher in past years than the figures reported by other states. Since <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is one of the first to release its figures, new data was unavailable in other states. In 1986, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had 8,238 serious crimes reported per 100,000 population, compared with 7,408 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 7,322 in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 7,081 in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 7,032 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 6,880 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 6,763 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 6,626 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 6,491.5 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and 6,290 in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> actually had the highest of all with 8,339 per 100,000 population. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the total arrests for cocaine last year were up 32.8 percent over 1986, while property crimes increased 6.7 percent over 1986. The number of motor vehicle thefts rose by 16.4 percent, and aggravated assaults showed a 3.1 percent increase. The number of reported murders and rapes was slightly down. Homicides declined from 1,371 to 1,368 and rapes declined from 6,153 to 6,017. More police officers were assaulted and killed in 1987 than the previous year, 10 compared with six. Assaults on police officers rose from 7,289 in 1986 to 7,833 in 1987. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> acknowledged that the overall crime increase was not as high as had been reported in recent years. From 1985 to 1986, his department reported a 7.9 percent increase. The increase was 11.4 percent from 1984 to 1985. `` It's true the rate of increase is dropping but it is still an increase,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said.

 A 31-month pretrial detention ended Monday for a defendant in the <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> robbery case after a judge approved arrangements for his $ 1 million bond. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was released after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> signed the papers. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> defendant, <PERSON> Filiberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, had been held without bond longer than any other defendants in federal judicial history. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>, testified before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate earlier Monday that his son would be disgraced `` personally and politically'' if he failed to appear for trial on charges in the 1983 robbery of $ 7 million from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. `` He is a person of great character,'' <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> said. `` If he said he will be here, he will be here.'' `` I'm happy, but I have to say the real issue is not my freedom,'' Harvard-educated <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 38, said as he walked out of court. `` The real issue is the freedom of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and preventive detention.'' <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who was arrested in August 1985 in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was held without bond until last month, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> set bond at $ 1 million. <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> has, however, refused to do the same for <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, saying the defendant could flee to avoid prosecution. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s bond is secured partly by $ 500,000 in property owned by 11 people in the town of <LOCATION> Naranjito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the hometown of his wife, <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> defendant who has been free on bond for some time. The other $ 500,000 is unsecured, but his parents and three siblings signed agreements to pay the money should <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> not appear for trial. Under terms of his bond, <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> can not leave <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, must be home by 10 p.m. each night and agreed that the government has the right to try him in absentia should he flee. The government also plans to require him to wear an electronic bracelet to monitor his movements, but none of the devices are available in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, said his attorney, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON>. Sixteen people are awaiting trial in the <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> robbery, which the government contends was masterminded by <PERSON> Los </PERSON> <PERSON> Matcheros </PERSON>, a radical, sometimes violent group advocating Puerto Rican independence. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> guard authorities allege carried out the robbery, has n't been captured. Prosecutors say they think he is in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Pretrial hearings in the case began 14 months ago and are expected to last several more months.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> passenger was free on bond Monday after allegedly battling police and ticket agents when he and 200 irate passengers were bumped off New York-bound flights.

<HEAD>Bush Looks For Super Super Tuesday; Democrats Try to Break From
the Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican presidential rivals searched Monday for a way to stop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from a clean sweep on Super Tuesday, while Democrats scoured the South for the votes that could propel one of them out of the tightly bunched pack on the biggest primary day in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said a sweep of the 17 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries was `` too much for anyone to expect.'' But he was leading polls in virtually every Super Tuesday state except <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, where Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> had a narrow edge. Even <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` it's fair to say <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a good margin,'' but said the race is tight in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Earlier, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, `` My philosophy in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> ought to sell like hotcakes, but so far it is n't happening. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is getting a lot of ruboff from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> claimed polls show `` that I beat all the Democrats. -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- does n't beat any of them ... We ought to nominate a winner instead of a loser.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, hoping to emerge from the Super Tuesday contests in his home state and 20 others with a delegate lead, campaigned at a retirees' condominium development in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and picked up the backing of <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, 74, a onetime <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ward organizer now known for her prowess in turning retirees out to vote. She called him `` a person of integrity who gets things done'' and `` a mensch,'' using the Yiddish word for good man. Asked if Super Tuesday was a flop in bringing moderate and conservative Democrats back to the party's fold, the governor replied, `` It's not been a flop for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Four of his rivals _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> _ were in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Monday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, hoping the allegiance of black voters throughout the South will give him his finest hour in two runs for the presidency, visited an AIDS clinic in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and journeyed to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he pledged to fight efforts to make English the official language of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are a great nation. We can speak more than one language,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman who has staked his campaign on a tough stance against countries with unfair trade practices, made a pitch in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for an oil import fee and campaigned in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> in front of a landmark. `` We're standing today in front of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, a place where there was a fight for independence,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` This election in 1988 is a fight again for the independence of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the fight for us to regain control of our economic destiny.'' In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, outside a plant that has cut its production of oil field equipment nearly in half, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said, `` Anyone like <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who tells you that they're for making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> energy-independent without being for an oil import fee is simply trying to deceive you in a shameful way.'' `` Something's happening out there,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, insisting the undecided vote was breaking his way. He said the Democrats would have a two-man race after Tuesday, and he would be one of the two. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> got a boost from Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, who left word after he departed on a trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that he had cast an absentee ballot for the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> raised again his claim that there are Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, telling a satellite radio audience in 18 states, `` I do n't think the missiles ever got taken out in'62. And I am somewhat convinced that more missiles have been introduced.'' A federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dismissed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 35 million libel suit against former Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, who questioned his Korean war record. The judge said <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> was the prevailing party in the acrimonious lawsuit. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> agreed to pay court costs but not <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s legal fees. Super Tuesday, the biggest primary day in history, saw <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters go the primary polls in 17 states and Democrats choose candidates in 20 states. There are 712 Republican and 1,307 Democratic delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was hoping for a strong harvest of delegates from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, talking with reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II en route to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was asked about the possibility of a sweep. `` You always wish for that, but I certainly would never predict that. It's took much for anyone to expect,'' he replied. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who clobbered <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s primary on Saturday, admitted he was tired. `` It's been a difficult effort leading up to Super Tuesday,'' he said, adding that on Tuesday itself `` we've got a pretty relaxing day _ except for the tension factor.''

In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the biggest Super Tuesday prize with 111 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> talked about military needs and about his contentions concerning missiles. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, they thought it was a gaffe when I said there were missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but those Cubans -LRB- in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- do n't believe it's a gaffe. They believe there's <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' he said. Later, in a call-in show on <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> KFLO </ORGANIZATION> radio, he said, `` Everybody in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area _ almost without exception _ certainly 95 percent of those Cuban-Americans know in their hearts that there are missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. I do n't think the missiles ever got taken out in'62. And I am somewhat convinced that more missiles have been introduced.'' To support his contention, he said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> has denied the missiles are there and has criticized <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> for saying they are. On other subjects raised on the call-in show, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said: _ `` There has been filed, by a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a suit in the federal court alleging that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is unconstitutional. I think it's true.'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> needs people like -LRB- Justices -RRB- <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> -LRB- and defeated nominee -RRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, people like that, who honor the Constitution as it was written. _ `` Not one of the trading partners of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> truly is dealing fairly with us. They're either restricting imports into their country on the one hand, or they are subsidizing unfairly exports from their country to us.'' _ `` I believe, in my heart, and from some indication from some people who I've talked to, that there are American servicemen still in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. They are n't in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, they're in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. ... I believe we could put a throttle-hold around some of those Southeast Asian nations, to make them insist those missing-in-action people come out of there.'' _ Raising the possibility of an alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think if we had an alternate organization of free nations, democratic nations, who did not commit terrorism and did not torture and abuse their own citizens, we could have the power of the world And we could exclude from that agency the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> countries and these other dictators that are practicing slavery and what have you against their people.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge dismissed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 35 million suit against former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had accused <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of ducking combat duty during the Korean War `` The judge gave me what I consider a real victory,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said during a news conference at <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>' Municipal Airport. However, <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said, `` This is a confirmation of my integrity.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in asking that the suit be dropped, `` is admitting that he is the one who is the liar,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said. `` The court's service was to unmask this man as the fraud he is.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said he had to ask that the suit be dismissed since he could n't pursue the presidency and go through the trial that was to start on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Makes Sales Pitch on Economic Reform to Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has told factory workers not to be discouraged by slow improvements in their standard of living and to have faith in his overhaul of the economy. He visited the enormous <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, his first meeting with rank-and-file workers since a sweeping law took effect Jan. 1 giving factories more financial independence from central ministries. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was particularly sensitive to complaints about poor housing and food and said they were top priorities for improvement. The 57-year-old Soviet leader visited the factory Friday but media did not report on the trip until Monday. Why the reports were delayed was not clear. `` Of course we have a sufficient number of problems,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the workers. `` Part of them are left from the past, others were born today, in the course of restructuring, in the process of realizing economic reforms. That's natural. But I have the impression that you have n't panicked, and I would say are optimistically looking to the future and confidently going forward.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has visited factories several times since becoming <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary three years ago, highlighting the importance he attaches to workers' roles in reviving the sluggish Soviet economy. The ball bearing plant employs 20,000 factory and office workers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he wanted to get a first-hand look at how the government's new economic reforms are being implemented. `` For politics, the most important thing is to know the mood of the people, to feel the pulse of life,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in remarks carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. He explained to the workers why some of his economic policies may be hard to swallow, because they mean harder work and in some cases less pay. Salaries, he said, must be adjusted according to the productivity and quality of labor. `` How can you pay someone a full ruble if he has n't earned it? What will he buy with this money?'' he said. He said the reason desired goods have not been available in stores is that workers were guaranteed salaries whether or not they did their jobs properly. Under the new law, managers at factories responsible for 60 percent of the country's industrial output can bargain with suppliers and wholesale customers for some products. Enterprises are free to keep some of their profits, but those that are unsuccessful are liable to be declared bankrupt. The factories set workers' salaries according to the quality of their work. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> critcized plant managers who try to find an easy way out of improving output by buying foreign equipment. `` Obviously you must buy some things, but only that which is absolutely necessary, and you should rely on your own domestic machine-building, on the achievements of our engineering.'' He assured the workers socialism will not be threatened by the country's growing private enterprises, known as cooperatives. `` It's understood that we need industrious and honest initiative, but not of the kind of some cooperatives which exploit a deficit and engage in outright money-grabbing,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Limited private enterprise has been allowed to supplement state-run enterprises since May 1987. Prices of the goods and services produced by cooperatives are generally much higher, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the workers the government plans to get its fair share of profits, through a progressive tax.

<HEAD>Judge Bars INS from Routine Strip-Searching of Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Routine strip searches of children awaiting deportation are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled Monday, saying immigration agents must first have a reasonable suspicion that drugs or weapons have been hidden. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> rejected an Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> argument that the body-cavity searches are needed because adults will use children as couriers if agents can not search them. `` Children confined by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> are not charged with any criminal offense, let alone an offense that might indicate a propensity to conceal weapons or contraband on their persons,'' <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> ruled. In 1987, of 84,000 aliens searched, there were 20 discoveries of contraband or weapons, only four of which were related to juveniles, <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> noted. His ruling came in a class-action suit filed in 1985 by a coalition of immigrants' rights groups that challenged what they described as routine strip-searches of children upon admission to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention facilities and following all visits with anyone other than attorneys. Children are particularly susceptible to trauma from strip searches, <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> said. He rejected an argument by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fan </PERSON> that children from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have no expectation of privacy when arrested here. `` Many carry the expectation of liberty, opportunity and a better life, the embodiment of which is our Constitution,'' <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> wrote. Only children are affected by the ruling. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer involved in the suit, said the ruling covers all nine states in the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' Western Region.

 S <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Nazi-hunting unit has identified 9,800 people as former concentration camp guards and said Monday it will have them placed on the immigration watch list of individuals to be barred from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Office of Special Investigations compiled the names with the assistance of a sophisticated new computer database. Names of suspected criminals and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> persecutors are systematically checked against immigration records to determine if they are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The names of individuals not found to be in this country are included in the watch list to prevent them from entering. <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION> has listed thousands of such people in the past few years. But the 9,800 now to be placed on the watch list of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` for serving as concentration and death camp guards is probably the greatest number'' to be added at one time, said the office's chief, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>. The watch list includes people who are prohibited from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under a federal law barring individuals who assisted or otherwise participated in Nazi-sponsored persecution. The provision, known as the Holtzman Amendment, was invoked when Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was placed on the watch list last year following a decision by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cited evidence that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had participated in activities amounting to persecution of Jews and others in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in World War II when he was a German army intelligence officer. The immigration watch list contains some 40,000 names. In addition to those participating in Nazi-directed persecution, the list contains the names of criminals, known terrorists, communists or people who have been deported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said names submitted by the office of special investigations are routinely added to the watch list.

<HEAD>U.S. Again Says It Wants Early Response to Mideast Peace Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration renewed its request on Monday for an `` early response'' from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. It also said it welcomed the `` the support and advice'' of 30 senators who contend <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be willing to give up control of occupied land in return for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the administration is looking for a reply to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan to set up negotiations on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule by May 1. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>'s comment appeared to be directed to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who is due in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week for meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` We believe all the parties understand and appreciate the reason that we've asked for these kind of responses,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> just returned from a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trip during which he promoted a plan to bring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and Palestinian Arabs to a peace conference by May 1. One goal is to stop violence in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> regions that has claimed some 80 Arab lives in three months. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> on Monday on his travels. On Sunday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> blocked a decision by the Israeli Cabinet on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative. He said he would permit a vote after he returns from his talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had demanded a Cabinet decision before <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> departed. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> avoided a direct reaction to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s move, but he went on to call for an `` early response'' from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments _ <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> _ to whom <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> submitted his plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said during his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> travels last week that he hoped for a reply within about 10 days. He said he believed in deadlines as a way of accelerating action. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked about the letter from the 23 Democrats and seven Republicans, a group that included several strong supporters of the Jewish state. The senators noted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has in the past supported the idea of `` land for peace'' by returning the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. But they cited a statement by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that `` this expression of territory for peace is not accepted by me.'' `` We hope that the prime minister's statement did not indicate that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is abandoning a policy that offers the best hope for long-term peace,'' said the letter, dated March 3. `` The administration welcomes the support and advice from this group. They are senators of considerable stature and interest and involvment in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` We are in the midst of an ongoing processs. The views of these senators are helpful to us and probably instructive to other parties in the region,'' he added. The spokesman said the administration was involved in a process `` that involves a blend of some new ideas and new beliefs,'' but he refused to comment further. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would respond to the letter. He declined to address the matter further, except to say the administration prefers `` to maintain a certain discreet distance'' in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace process. When he returned Saturday from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> expressed no criticism of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s position. He said the prime minister and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> agreed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annexation of territory could be a topic for negotiations. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have openly endorsed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposals, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have not Strong supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> signing the letter included senators <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich.; and <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Monday that two leaders would emerge from the Democratic presidential field after Super Tuesday balloting and he would be one of them. `` Something's happening out there,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, wrapping up his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign with an airport appearance in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, his fifth visit to the city in the past three weeks. `` The undecided vote is still large but it is breaking our way. We are getting reports from all over the Super Tuesday area and all indicate exactly the same thing. Our campaign has the momentum.'' The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said his polls throughout the South show him surpassing <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and trailing only <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We have gained more in the last 24 hours than any other candidate,'' he said. `` If our people get to the polls, we are going to pull off a major surprise to those people who were beginning to think it was a two-person race. It's going to be a two-person race all right, but they're going to have a different two candidates in mind.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> refused to identify the candidate he saw as also emerging as a front-runner after Tuesday's elections. `` I'm not going to pick the field,'' he said. `` You'll be able to see the pattern develop.'' Asked what would happen if he finished fourth, he replied: `` I refuse to accept that. That's not going to happen. Write it down and check it twice. We're going to come out with a very surprising victory.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he picked up the endorsements Monday of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s top officer says he never dreamed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's military build-up would be derailed so quickly, but he intends to maintain readiness even as his service shrinks. Gen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> also said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> could n't afford to develop the new Midgetman nuclear missile favored by many congressional leaders; said he would press for salary bonuses for pilots and make it easier for young pilots to stay in the cockpit; and would shut down at least three <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> let him The four-star general added the public should n't be too concerned by press reports of delays in flight testing the new `` Stealth'' bomber, and said he intends to repair strained relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with a new openness about the onset of contracting problems. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> was interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of congressional hearings on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1989 budget. That budget blueprint, designed to comply with a deficit-reduction plan, cuts <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spending authority by $ 10 billion compared with what the service wanted and eliminates more than 23,000 active-duty job slots. The 53-year-old <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said it already was clear when he took over the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986 that military spending was going to be slashed. `` But we thought at the worst, we would level -LRB- off -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> added. `` We never expected a real decline. We were certainly not expecting that from 1985 through 1989, there would be a 13 percent overall decline in real buying power.'' The only way to cope with such cuts, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> continued, is to reduce the size of the force. Otherwise, too little money is spread too thinly to maintain combat readiness, he said. `` To keep a ready force, we'll have to have a somewhat smaller force,'' the general said. `` And we will be deferring some things, delaying some things.'' Among the programs taking a large cut is the Midgetman missile, a one-warhead nuclear missile that would be deployed on a truck-like launcher to make it more survivable. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would like to kill the program outright, but requested enough money to keep research going until a new administration makes a final decision. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said he knew that congressional Democrats favored the project. But the Midgetman is so expensive it makes more sense to develop a mobile rail launcher for the existing 10-warhead MX missile, he said. Deploying the Midgetman would cost $ 36 billion `` and the only place we can find to take another $ 36 billion is out of conventional forces,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. That's too high of a pricetag `` for an incremental contribution to deterrence,'' he added. Asked what would happen if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused money for both the Midgetman or a rail-mobile MX, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> replied: `` I think that would be absolutely irresponsible.'' Turning to other topics, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are strained because of a perception the service tried to cover up problems with the B-1B bomber That is `` an absolutely false charge,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said, because in truth the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> itself `` was badly surprised by the lag in the development'' of B-1B radar-jamming gear. Nonetheless, `` we are -LRB- now -RRB- going to great pains to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> thoroughly informed on anything that looks like a problem.'' _ There's no reason for concern at this point about a delay in flight testing the radar-evading Stealth, or B-2, bomber Sources have said the first flight test was pushed back four months to August because of technical problems. `` I think we've been very realistic about -LRB- the B-2 -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. `` Unlike some other programs, we did n't say five years in advance that we're going to fly that airplane on the 23rd of May. We knew better. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is asking for money to pay its pilots a salary bonus because re-enlistment rates have fallen to unacceptable levels Retention rates are running about 48 percent compared with the target 60 percent, and for the first time in years, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> expects to end fiscal 1989 with an overall shortage of pilots _ 22,312 on duty compared with 22,556 needed. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also will try to keep its pilots happy by changing promotion policies to make it clear to young lieutenants and captains they should concentrate on flying, and not worry about finding staff jobs to make them more promotable _ And if he had his druthers, he would try to save money by closing unneeded bases <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> declined to identify his candidates, but said three bases could probably be closed quickly.

 Federal testing of the nation's pork supply is being stepped up immediately as part of a crackdown on illegally high traces of a suspected cancer-causing drug used widely by hog producers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Officials said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will initiate random sampling of hog carcasses in 100 of the nation's largest swine slaughter plants for laboratory tests to determine levels of sulfamethazine. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials on Feb. 4 had announced their goal was `` to eliminate violative levels of the drug sulfamethazine'' in hogs marketed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Two hog carcasses will be tested at each plant during the initial phase of the program. If one or both hogs are found to contain drug traces at or above the permitted level of 0.1 part per million, the plant will be subjected to more intensive testing. Hog carcasses found to be within the drug's permitted level will be released for consumption. Those with higher residues will be condemned. A new `` sulfa-on-site'' -LRB- SOS -RRB- procedure for making quick screening tests in the plants without sending samples to laboratories for more detailed, time-consuming tests also is being incorporated into the program, said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> administrator. Sulfamethazine is used in swine to treat or prevent a number of diseases and also is used in subtherapeutic dosages in feed to promote faster growth and to improve weight gains. Illegally high traces of the drug have been a problem in an average of about 5 percent of the hogs going to slaughter. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxicological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> tentatively determined that sulfamethazine causes tumors in the thyroid glands of mice, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said last month when the new regulatory effort was announced.

 A sharp cold front brought a renewal of winter weather whistling across the central <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and the western Plains on Monday. A winter storm warning was posted through the night into Tuesday for the mountains of southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Snowfall totals of 8 to 16 inches were possible, along with gusty wind causing considerable blowing and drifting, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted into the night the southeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> plains and adjacent foothills and for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>No Prospect Yet for Bailout of S&amp;L Insurance Fund, Regulator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's too soon to consider bailing out the federal insurance fund for savings institutions or merging it with the healthier funds for commercial banks and credit unions, the nation's top regulator of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls said Monday. `` I think that's vastly premature,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Wall, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which backs S & amp; L deposits up to $ 100,000, has about $ 20 billion to work with over the next three years. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in August signed legislation recapitalizing <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which was technically insolvent and unable to deal with failed S & amp; Ls. The legislation provides $ 10.8 billion over three years from the sale of bonds, to be paid off by a special assessment on profitable institutions. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said it's too soon to determine whether that will be enough to handle the industry's problems, particularly in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> where S & amp; Ls have been hard hit by the faltering energy industry and the consequent moribund real estate market. `` There's no way of knowing what the -LRB- regional -RRB- economies will be or will have been in three years. ... -LRB- A rebound -RRB- could occur in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It could occur in other areas of the country. It could blow all of our problems completely out of the water in a positive way,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. His comments came less than a week after two thrift industry lobby groups began discussing the future of the insurance fund. A committee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the largest S & amp; L trade association, discussed a plan that would require billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out the ailing thrift industry. According to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a vice president of the league, the committee talked about a number of possible scenarios, including one that envisioned the issue of government notes to S & amp; Ls. The notes would be traded for bad loans owned by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and would be guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the committee meeting was simply a `` brain-storming session'' and the plan `` is by no stretch of the imagination a proposal.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> discussion, as well as a proposal to merge insurance funds, are particularly controversial because the thrift industry, seeking a smaller burden on healthy S & amp; Ls, argued for a smaller recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, another trade association, is proposing, as a contingency plan, a merger of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which had $ 18.3 billion at the end of 1987. The plan is unpopular with banks, which pay a premium for deposit insurance that is less than half the premium paid by savings institutions. A merger with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Share </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which has about $ 1.3 billion, is equally unpopular with that industry. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, chairman of the council, said last week that <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> likely wo n't have enough money to take care of all insolvent S & amp; Ls. Wall talked of resolving the cases of 50 insolvent S & amp; Ls this year in addition to about 100 cases in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Losses for the industry as a whole are expected to surpass $ 4 billion for 1987. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> argues that there's a limit to how much more healthy S & amp; Ls can contribute and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will not want to earmark tax money without first tapping into the other insurance funds. Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckza </PERSON>, D-Wis., has introduced legislation that would merge the three insurance funds, as well as the federal agencies that regulate the three segments of the financial system The council, however, would keep the regulatory agencies separate. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he saw little prospect, at least in the near term, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would approve a merger of the funds or of the regulatory apparatus and he argued that they were better left apart.

<HEAD>Court To Rule On Case Involving Trademarked Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday postponed until later in the year a ruling in a multibillion-dollar battle over so-called `` gray market'' goods, the growing business that allows consumers to purchase costly imports at steep discounts. The justices announced they again will hear arguments in the case in April with a decision expected by July. The case will be re-argued with Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last month, taking part in the deliberations. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s participation in the case will give the court six members, a quorum, to consider the underlying dispute. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not take part as the court ruled, 5-3, on Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> does not have exclusive authority over the dispute. The majority said that a federal judge properly considered the case. The three justices who dissented did so on a procedural issue. They said the federal courts lacked jurisdiction, a decision that would in effect disqualify them from considering the merits of the case. The dispute is over interpretation of the Federal Tariff Act of 1930. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the law allows gray market goods into the country without approval from trademark owners. Two leading discount distributors, <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> 47th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, also are defending the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations. Typically, the discount companies buy trademarked products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more cheaply than do the owners of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademarks. Some 60 major companies that own trademarks banded together to form the Coalition to Preserve the <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademarks </ORGANIZATION> and challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations. A federal judge upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations. But the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled last year that the rules are invalid under the 1930 tariff act. The statute prohibits unauthorized imports of `` any merchandise of foreign manufacture if such merchandise ... bears a trademark owned by a citizen of, or by a corporation or association created or organized within, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the law protects only American companies that purchase trademarks from independent foreign manufacturers and does not protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> subsidiaries, affiliates or parent companies of foreign manufacturers. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> wrote Monday's opinion upholding the authority of the federal courts to rule in the dispute. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Dissenting on the jurisdictional issue were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Mayor Shakes Up Public Works Department In Wake Of TV Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A television expose showing city workers goofing off has added fuel to a campaign to recall Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, the mayor's opponents said Monday. A top public works official and two street workers lost their jobs and <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> suspended four others following the <ORGANIZATION> KUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> report last week about city street crews. The mayor, who announced the action over the weekend, said he will continue his investigation of the allegations and within the next week expects to discipline several mid-level supervisors in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the city's largest agency with 1,770 employees. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is pushing the <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> recall, said the revelations have `` added impetus to our movement, absolutely.'' The campaign has half the petition signatures needed to force an election to replace <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, who was re-elected to a second three-year term last year. Ms. <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> said she has not counted how many signatures have been gathered on the 1,200 petitions being circulated. A <ORGANIZATION> KUSA </ORGANIZATION> reporter and cameraman, using an unmarked car, followed six city street crews around for several days to see what they accomplished. Only two crews were shown working without excessive breaks. In one case, a pothole repair crew did no work at all during an eight-hour period, spending the time visiting several food stores and loafing near parks. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, deputy manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, resigned following the reports, and <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> then fired two workers and suspended four others. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was `` a hard-working and dedicated employee'' who had `` the fortitude ... to tender his resignation in the best interest of the city. And I agree with that conclusion.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees, said two of the disciplined public works employees are innocent and their punishments would be appealed. He also blamed the department's problems, which include a $ 1 million budget deficit, on poor management, nepotism, cronyism and missing equipment. `` I will be meeting with the mayor this week, probably on Thursday, and I will have a long list of documented problems and incidents we've brought to their attention,'' he said. `` Hopefully, this time he'll deal with it.'' The movement to recall <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> began after citizens complained of unplowed, impassable streets following a Christmas weekend snowstorm. The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has until mid-April to collect 40,000 petition signatures. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and three other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Saturday announced their opposition to the recall drive. `` Properly filling potholes'' is an issue worth debating, but not serious enough to merit a recall election, the governor said. Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., said <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> `` is the person who has finally broken loose the airport and has made the convention center come closer to being a reality Those are the issues it seems to me that we ought to be talking about.'' <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is close to reaching agreement to build a new, $ 4 billion airport in neighboring <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to replace <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and it will begin construction soon on a $ 115 million convention center.

 Communist guerrillas ambushed a vehicle near <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, killing three civilians and six Filipino sailors assigned to the U.S.-run naval base, the military said Monday. The sailors, and three civilians who had hitched a ride, were traveling from <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Sunday when rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fired on their Land-Rover near <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> 40 miles west of the capital, the Philippine Constabulary reported. There were no reports of rebel casualties in the 15-minute battle. <PERSON> Subic </PERSON>, about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, is one of six military facilities operated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under an executive agreement that expires in 1991. Communist rebels operate near both <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Last October, guerrillas killed three Americans and a Filipino in coordinated attacks outside <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. In a related development Monday, two Philippine Constabulary troopers held hostage by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels for more than a month said they killed nine guerrillas in an escape the day before. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabua </PERSON> said they were captured Feb. 3 at a rebel checkpoint outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a town near <LOCATION> Catanauan </LOCATION>, 110 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province. They spoke to Filipino reporters in <LOCATION> Catanauan </LOCATION>. They said they were tied up for 32 days and were moved from place to place. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nabua </PERSON> also said a foreigner they did not identify took videotape pictures of them.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired missiles into each other's largest cities Monday and sent aircraft to bomb towns in the second week of a long-range duel that has killed hundreds of civilians. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired three missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Revolutionary Guards fired five missiles at `` military centers'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in retaliation for `` these inhuman acts,'' and hit the northern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> with a missile for the first time. Both sides reported their border towns pounded by sustained artillery fire and air raids that killed scores of people. It was the eighth day of missile exchanges between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors, which have been at war since September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> confirmed that two missiles fell on residential sections of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, whose population is 5 million, killing or wounding `` many civilians, including women and children.'' It said a missile hit a residential district of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>, killing or wounding civilians and damaging several houses, shops and cars. <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> also was reported bombed. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, the Iranian agency, said 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, most of them women and children. It said one missile demolished a clinic, a school and several homes. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it has fired 41 missiles into the Iranian capital since the exchanges began Feb. 29. The Iranians have reported firing 23 missiles on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in that period, but the have acknowledged only 18 hits. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, Labor Minister <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasoul </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began the latest round in the `` war of the cities to pave the way for its new -LRB- ground -RRB- offensive.'' Vice President <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhieddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON>, also addressing the gathering of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> labor ministers, said `` Our armed forces are fully ready to rout any Iranian offensive.'' They apparently referred to threats Saturday by <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, to answer the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missile barrage with action along the 730-mile border war front. Asian diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, an emissary of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, delivered a letter from President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> for President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as part of a diplomatic effort to stop the aerial war. Its contents were not disclosed. The missile exchange is the fiercest of the war. It is the first time surface-to-surface missiles have hit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which is 290 miles from the Iraqi border. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> periodically has launched missiles at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, which is only 80 miles from the frontier. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reported at least 122 civilians killed and more than 300 wounded by missiles, and more than 100 killed and 500 wounded in air raids during the past week. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has reported heavy civilian casualties, but not exact figures. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news agency said 61 civilians were killed and 427 wounded by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids on Shiraz in the south and Dezful, <LOCATION> Khorramabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> and a dozen other cities in the west. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its planes attacked the cities of <LOCATION> Hamadan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kermanshah </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio confirmed a raid on <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION>, but there was no immediate word on casualties or damage. It said Iranian warplanes raided <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, the southern <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port near the border, and <LOCATION> As-Sadiq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> in the southwest. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, `` many civilians'' were killed or wounded in the raids. The Iranians said their artillery hammered military and economic targets in <LOCATION> Amarah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qurna </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, north of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, through the night and morning. They said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> gunners shelled <LOCATION> Marivan </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, killing one person and wounding several.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Monday he would press on with his Republican presidential campaign regardless of the outcome of the Super Tuesday contests. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told a news conference at the state Capitol that his disappointing showing in the race so far had not caused him to consider dropping out. `` I'm running for ideas, for a cause, to keep the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution alive,'' he said. He said he did not know how he would do on Super Tuesday, but thought the race would remain open. And he said he planned to press his campaign in next week's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he saw himself as `` a bridge candidate,'' whom followers of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> all could turn to if the race is not wrapped up by the time of the Republican National Convention. `` I think ultimately that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is going to want a conservative to follow <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he said. He repeated his assertion that he is not interested in the vice presidential nomination. `` I do n't expect it. I do n't think it will be offered. I do n't want it And besides, I'm a quarterback and not a lineman,'' said the former professional football player. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> conceded that the oil and agriculture industries had not shared fully in the economic successes of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But he said he did not favor an oil import fee, calling that `` a quick fix.'' He said lower interest rates would help the energy industry more in the long run. He also advocated repealing the windfall profits tax and called for further deregulation of natural gas. In a speech to the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Legislature </LOCATION> prior to the news conference, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> drew applause when he denounced Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and called for continued support of the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said it would be `` a big mistake'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to accept a communist base in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said that would pose a threat to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s neighbors and `` ultimately to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met Monday with Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to increase high technology exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. During toasts following their <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, the two leaders hailed the progress in bilateral relations and made almost no reference to issues which divide them. Chief among them is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reported sales of military weaponry to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in defiance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The administration has been seeking assurances from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that it will not veto an embargo resolution. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has generally refrained from public condemnations of the Chinese sales, and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Monday alluded only to press reports in both countries of U.S.-Chinese `` differences'' on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. Administration officials have indicated a willingness to increase high technology exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in exchange for a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> commitment to halt delivery of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made no direct link between the two issues, he indicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in increasing sales of sophisticated technology to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Over the last five years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has significantly liberalized its controls over technology exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and we are prepared to do more to ensure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters remain competitive in the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> market,'' he said. Last October, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by suspending the process under which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been given increasing access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products with advanced technology. Since then, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said it has stopped selling Silkworms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity, said `` our information is that they've been living up to that.'' Still, before resuming liberalization of the high technology trade, `` we want to be sure we're in sync with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> on what we're talking about.'' the official said. `` We believe the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> position has been responsive to our concerns, but we want to be sure that this responsiveness will continue.'' Although no details of their private talks were disclosed, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also was expected to discuss with <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for direct Arab-Israeli peace talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> were cordial and covered a range of international issues They said discussions later in the week will focus on human rights and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> situation. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is trying to structure a peace conference in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would serve as sponsors _ but without the power to impose the terms of a settlement. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made no reference in his remarks to recent anti-Chinese rioting in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said between three and nine people are believed to have been killed, and he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. He also reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is an integral part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, discussing shared interests of the two countries, said both have opposed the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the Vietnamese military intervention in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is convinced that a secure <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in the interest not only of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the states of the East Asian region,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Wu, in turn, said there is great potential for continued development of U.S.-Chinese relations, `` yet there are also obstacles and difficulties. `` Therefore, our two sides have no reason to rest content with the present status,'' he said. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> also met with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on Monday. He will meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Monday sought an urgent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting to demand an end to the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> `` war of the cities,'' and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insisted anew on an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> told reporters he expected a meeting of the 15-member council by Wednesday. He said the Soviets will introduce a resolution demanding an end to the devastating missile bombardment of both capitals. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, however, has been reluctant to push for a punitive arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for delay in complying with a cease-fire as demanded by the council last July 20. The Soviets have been improving relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said his government favors more time for diplomacy before imposing a weapons ban against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> on Monday urged the council to act quickly on an arms embargo resolution. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> meanwhile demanded that the council condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for starting the deadly war of the cities now in its second week. Both sides claim the strikes on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> are defensive and retaliatory. Both are believed to be using Soviet-made missiles in the missile attacks, the most intense in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war As the council met behind closed doors to discuss the missile strikes, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s attempt to stave off an embargo with an ambiguous note to the council appeared to have failed. The `` undated, unsigned scrap of paper'' does not `` constitute a clear acceptance'' of Security Council Resolution 598, British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said Monday. `` If they accept, they should say so _ loudly, clearly and unequivocally.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sees nothing new in the `` non-paper'' and `` very much doubts that anyone else does either.'' He told reporters that in pursuing the arms embargo, `` We are continuing active consultations with other council members to achieve consensus on this resolution, which we are convinced would help bring the gulf war to an end.'' The unsigned note handed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president last week claims a Feb. 28 letter from Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Albar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> constituted acceptance of the council's cease-fire resolution. The letter, however, did not say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> endorsed the resolution. `` We also note that several Iranian spokesmen have issued statements over the past few days disavowing the non-paper released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> noted. The agreement of all five permanent council members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ is needed to pass an arms embargo resolution. Each has a veto. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said the stumbling block is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would probably raise the issue in talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this week. The Soviets are close allies of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> but have also been trying to improve relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Crowds in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, angered at being the target of Soviet-made missiles, tried to storm the Soviet Embassy over the weekend. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> denied that `` the defensive weapons now used against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other cities'' are Soviet-made. He also urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to stop the attacks and described the escalation in the war of the cities as a major development in the gulf conflict. `` We consider this as just not another espisode in the war ... We think that the war between cities adds some new dimension to the protracted military conflict between the two neighboring countries,'' he said. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said he met Monday with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and with the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> this month, Yugoslav Ambassador <PERSON> Dragoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pejic </PERSON>, and urged them `` in the most energetic terms'' to try to persuade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to stop the missile attacks. `` The position of my country is clear. We are for the soonest possible political resolution of the war conflict between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and for the speediest possible implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598.''

 A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives sent a scathing letter to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to express `` outrage and dismay'' over the slaying of a black activist. Seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators signed a similar letter to <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that also protested the Jan. 24 slaying of <PERSON> Godfry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sicelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON>, 18. <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid activist, was killed four days after police questioned him about his appearance in foreign television documentaries, including a CBS documentary, `` Children of Apartheid.'' `` We the undersigned members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are writing to express our outrage and dismay at the assassination of <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sicelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON>,'' said the letter, signed by 31 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` He is one of more than two dozen anti-apartheid activists killed in mysterious circumstances since 1980,'' it said. `` None of these killings have been solved by the police, lending allegations of official involvement greater credibility. `` Physical evidence attests to the fact that Mr. <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON> was beaten and tortured, and it is common knowledge that intimidation and threats are everyday tools of the South African Security Police. `` A <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in flames will be the inevitable result of your government's failure to reform security police tactics and work toward a democratic society. We strongly urge a prompt and thorough investigation into Mr. <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON>'s death and other apartheid-related crimes.'' Some of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who signed the Feb. 11 letter will participate in hearings on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> beginning March 15. The letter to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was initiated by <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill. Police arrested <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON> during a raid on the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> offices of a civil rights organization on Jan. 20 and questioned him about his statements in several foreign news films After his body was found near his parents' home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, several anti-apartheid groups said they suspected police involvement. The police have denied involvement and have offered a $ 2,500 reward for the arrest of the killer or killers. The letter signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members, written by Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., said: `` We have a very strong interest in <PERSON> Sicelo </PERSON> and require your government to allow an independent body to investigate the circumstances under which he was murdered. The House letter addressed <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as prime minister, a post he has not held since 1984 when he became president under a new constitution.

<HEAD>Briton Begins Begins Military Maneuvers In Falklands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> began a 25-day military exercise Monday to test its ability to protect the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> from invasion, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> said its forces would be on `` defensive alert.'' `` At this stage, it's very much a paper exercise,'' a ministry spokesman said. `` The exercise will start with intelligence reports that an enemy is raising the threat level. They will play out a scenario.'' An infantry batallion of 600-1 ,000 soldiers based in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will fly to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> archipelago March 17-18, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims the islands off its coast, which it calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>, and invaded them in April 1982. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sent a naval task force and won a 74-day war that killed 712 Argentines and 258 Britons. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says the exercise, called Fire Focus, is purely defensive. One of its functions will be to test a new $ 690 million airport built since the war. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the armed forces minister, said criticism of the exercise from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and other Latin American nations resulted from misunderstanding of its size. `` I do not see how something which is purely a defensive exercise can be seen as provocative,'' he said. `` We have to defend the Falklands. We had a very unfortunate experience six years ago. We not only have a right to have a defensive garrison in the Falklands, we have a responsibility to do so.'' The exercise, scheduled to end March 31, is the largest since the war and the first with reinforcements flown from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Military units could not be airlifted in 1982 because the airport was inadequate, and the naval force took weeks to reach the islands. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> says the islands are part of its inheritance from <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> colonial rule and claims <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> stole them in 1833. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has refused to discuss sovereignty, declaring that the 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> Falkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> prefer to remain British, but <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said: `` In other respects we would like to have more normal relations with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Toribio </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> said Monday the nation's military commanders will select in June or July the candidate for a yes-or-no presidential vote later this year. It was the first time a time frame has been set for the nomination of the presidential candidate. No date has been set for the election. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the general who has ruled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since the 1973 coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, has given every indication he will seek the nomination. As the powerful army commander, the 72-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will be among the four military chieftains selecting the candidate for an eight-year term. Merino spoke with reporters after a meeting of the law-making, four-member junta that he heads. He said the presidential election `` has to take place during the second half'' of this year. According to the 1980 constitution drafted by the armed forces, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s president for the 1989-97 term will be chosen in a yes-or-no plebiscite on a single candidate. The candidate will be named by the commanders of the army, navy, air force and national police. If the military-picked candidate is rejected by the voters, an open presidential election must be called in 1990 with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then, according to the constitution.

 Democrats <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are in a battle of their own in Tuesday's Southern primaries, competing for the same voters and harboring hopes of knocking each other out of the presidential race. With <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> poised to collect the South's considerable black vote, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scoring with Southern liberals, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> are both vying for what's left: the moderate and conservative, blue-collar and middle-income white voters. Acknowledging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may do very well Tuesday, each would like to emerge as the white alternative to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. And each would like to move on to the next round of contests without the other, trying to draw a bead on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> have scaled back Southern expectations as their initial strategies have not been fulfilled. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> concentrated on the early <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> contest, hoping it would propel him. But his victory there has n't provided momentum in the South. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> played on regional appeal, but that has n't been enough in a field fractured by so many candidates. The result: Each needs to beat the other to continue. `` There are two Gs in this race and only one G is going North,'' said one source close to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign, insisting on anonymity. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s tough foreign trade-retaliation message and the powerful television commercials that helped him in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> have been overwhelmed by the enormity of campaigning in the 20 states of Super Tuesday. He has spent about $ 1.2 million on television _ and has been outspent three-to-one by both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has been pummeling <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in tough negative television commercials that the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign acknowledges has been effective against their candidate. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has branded <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a `` phony flip-flopper.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also has slammed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> with television ads that depict him as a flip-flopper on issues. `` We have been pinned down in a very tough negative crossfire between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> polltaker <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` They have gone to any areas we have strengths, especially <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, and just beat the ... out of us. That's effective ... but I think the net effect is going to be to drive -LRB- voter -RRB- turnout down, very very low.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has run ads attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, but the main focus of the television attack has been on <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` Ideally for the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign, we would like to _ and we expect to _ narrow the field by eliminating <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, thereby creating a situation where Senator <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> can focus clearly on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll of the South released Monday night said that `` the biggest loser on Super Tuesday will probably be <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who is leading only in his home state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and could drop below the 15 percent threshold for delegates'' in 12 of 16 states polled. Both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> are focusing on the delegate count coming out of Super Tuesday rather than the number of states won. Neither predicts an outright win in the biggest states of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but they hope to collect a big share of delegates there. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> forces believe if they can push <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> into a fourth-place finish in delegates, and hold him to winning little more than his home state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, he will be staggered and unable to continue. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> forces scoff at that notion. `` They're not going to knock us out,'' said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` No way ... it's absurd.'' But both <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> face the prospect of leaving the South impoverished and facing, in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he wins <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a candidate who has demonstrated national appeal. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> took out a $ 1 million line of credit to saturate Southern television. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> faced a financial squeeze going into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> that limited his ability to run the ads that proved effective elsewhere, including his vow that unless <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> opened its markets he'd put so many taxes on their products a <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> automobile would cost $ 48,000. Noting that ad, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> may very well run out of gas on Tuesday night.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students vowed Monday to keep their campus closed indefinitely after the school's board of trustees reaffirmed its selection of a hearing presdent to head the nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf. `` We're going to keep the school closed,'' said student leader <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Covell </PERSON>. `` We will stop when we get a deaf president.'' <PERSON> Covell </PERSON> and around 1,800 of the school's 2,200 students protested at the Capitol after board of trustees chairman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Basset </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> told the students the board would not reconsider its decision to hire <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s next president. The selection of <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, an administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, was the product of a `` careful, reasoned'' search process, <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> said. `` A lawful, proper and final decision was made,'' she said. As <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> made her announcement in the school's field house, students listening there spilled out into the street and began a one-mile walk to the Capitol. <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> and several other board members listened for about 30 minutes to complaints from the 100 or so students, then left without speaking to reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf, was created by an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1864, and relies on federal funding for most of its operating budget. In fiscal year 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> received $ 62 million from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're trying to put some pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to get them to put some pressure on our board,'' said <PERSON> Covell </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, resident. `` After this, we'll march to the White House.'' Monday's protest capped a week of demonstrations in which students tried to convince the board of trustees to hire a deaf person as the school's seventh president. After <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> announced Sunday that <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> had won out over two deaf finalists, students walked to the hotel where the board was meeting, then continued their protest at the Capitol. Monday, students gathered before dawn and blocked all entrances to the campus, forcing officials to cancel classes for the day. A committee of 10 students, two faculty members and two staff members told the trustees that they wanted <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> replaced with a deaf president, the resignation of <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON>, and assurances that deaf people would constitute a majority of the school's 20-member board within three years. The student group and the trustees met for around three hours on the northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> campus before <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> announced that the decision made the day before would stand. `` I do not think I will ever experience a more frustrating feeling in my life,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON>, the school's dean of student life, who is deaf. `` I have been on the Gallaudet payroll for 35 years, and I have never felt so defeated.'' <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> was selected because she is a `` top caliber academician'' who also has the administrative and fund-raising skills the school was looking for. Deaf students claim that only a deaf person can truly understand their educational needs. <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> said she understood the students' frustration. `` I feel considerable empathy and compassion for the students,'' <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> said by telephone from her <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> office. `` I hope to speak with them soon, but given the intensity of this situation, it's only right for me to maintain some distance.'' Students had expressed outrage that <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> does not speak sign language, but the incoming president vowed to accelerate immediately her study of the language. `` I have a facility for learning it, and now that I have been hired, I plan to have an intensive training program.'' <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> was selected bu a 10-4 margin, with the three deaf members and one hearing member of the trustees' selection committee voting for one of the two deaf candidates <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, a deaf trustee who headed the search committee, said he and the committee's other deaf members lobbied to no avail for a deaf president. `` Your expressions outline exactly what we put on the table,'' <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive, told the students who remained on campus after <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON>'s announcement. `` We did the best we could do.'' <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON> asserted that the two other finalists for the post _ I. King <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s dean of the college of arts and sciences, and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corson </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf, in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. _ both were qualified to be <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s next president. `` No candidate has the perfect criteria, and they both were qualified. I think the committee's decision speaks for itself.''

 Jury selection began Monday in a trial of a Taiwanese gangster accused of killing a Chinese-American journalist openly critical of the Taiwanese government. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuei-sen </PERSON> has pleaded innocent in the 1984 shooting of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> at the writer's <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home. The plea puzzled his attorney, since the 35-year-old <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> testified two years ago in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> drug trial that he and a fellow member of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s largest criminal syndicate, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION> gang, gunned down <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> on government orders relayed by gang chief <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi-Li </PERSON>. `` I suspect he just wants to tell the jury and everyone else his story,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` He thought he was doing his government's bidding ... and he was left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said he expects the trial before <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to last two weeks and he will call up to 18 witnesses. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he was unsure how he would present his case. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> faces one count of murder and one special allegation that he used a gun in the Oct. 15, 1984, slaying. If convicted, he could face 27 years to life in prison. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> was convicted of heroin smuggling after a federal trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1986 and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, a long-term critic of the Taiwanese government, was a columnist for a Chinese-language newspaper in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and had just published a book that attacked the island nation's ruling party when he was killed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> condemned <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>'s murder and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearings were held to look into the murky circumstances surrounding it <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> has blamed the killing on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s former chief of military intelligence, Vice Admiral <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi-ling </PERSON>, who said he only directed that <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> be taught `` a lesson.'' Both <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> are serving life sentences in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after being convicted in the killing in a Taiwanese military court. Two intelligence officials who served under <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> are serving lesser terms. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON>, 35, the second gunman, is serving a life term for the killing in a <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> prison.

 A 300-pound bear that mauled a 2-year-old boy in a shopping mall was under quarantine Monday, as federal investigators began a probe into the animal's keepers, authorities said. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> of <PERSON> Galion </PERSON> was listed in fair condition at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with deep cuts to his scalp and face that required more than 100 stitches, officials said. He was attacked Saturday while posing with the Himalayan bear, named <PERSON> Fluffy </PERSON>, after a children's performance at a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. The bear was held at an undisclosed location, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, director of environmental health services for the <ORGANIZATION> Richland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The bear's owners had not sought return of the animal, and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> indicated the county would resist any efforts to return the bear. `` We will fight that, if necessary,'' he said. `` We have had some contact with the owners and indicated our intent ... to take over custody of the animal until we can find a more permanent disposition.'' The county might seek to destroy the animal, but that has not been determined, he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> investigators arrived in <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION> on Monday to look into the attack, police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcudi </PERSON> said. Owners of exotic animals must register with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this time, I do n't know what criminal charges could be filed,'' <PERSON> Arcudi </PERSON> said. `` It's more civil than criminal.'' Fluffy is one of four bears featured in the `` Goldilocks and Her Bears'' shopping-center attraction. A bear named <PERSON> Fluffy </PERSON> in the same troupe clawed a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, 4-year-old during a show last month, police said. That child required at least six stiches, police said, and the bear was quarantined five days before being released to its owner, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Naghtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. It was unclear whether the same bear was involved in both attacks, authorities said. In the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Naghtin </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Naghtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were charged for allowing wild animals to perform without a permit, police said. They pleaded guilty and were fined and sentenced to six months' probation. Permits were obtained for the <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION> performance, police said. Efforts to reach the Naghtins Monday were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Naghtin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who identified herself as the mother of the elder <PERSON> Naghtin </PERSON>, said she did not know where they were.

 The man whose attempted murder conviction led to the book and television movie `` Deadly Intentions'' was sentenced to 15 years in prison Monday on federal marijuana and weapons charges. The sentence was handed down after a prosecutor alleged that the defendant, former doctor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, planned to use blood serum containing the AIDS virus in a revenge scheme and planned to kill a former federal prosecutor. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> imposed the sentence and ordered <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> sent to a prison where he could receive psychiatric treatment. In an appeal for mercy, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, 40, said he `` got discouraged'' in prison after his 1979 conviction and `` picked up some bad attitudes.'' While in prison, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> wrote `` The Outlaw's Bible,'' under the pen name E.X. <PERSON> Boozhie </PERSON>. Prosecutors said the book instructs readers on how to avoid arrest. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> served 6 -LCB- years of a 15-year sentence in an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> prison for the attempted murder of his first wife, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>. He moved to Mobile in an attempt to regain his medical license. `` Judge, I do n't know if you believe a man can change,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to do my best.'' His current wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, turned to authorities when she discovered an ammunition box concealed in their home that contained an assortment of materials, including manuals on explosives and false identities. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> was convicted Jan. 21 of possessing a pistol after being convicted of a felony, and scheming to distribute marijuana to prisoners in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> where he had served time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told the judge Monday that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> planned to use the pistol and a bomb to `` blow up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office'' in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. Neither the pistol nor the bomb were introduced as evidence in the trial. Sessions said the ammunition box also contained two vials of blood serum containing the AIDS virus. He said the virus was confirmed by testing at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Eason </PERSON> said authorities could only surmise how <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> planned to use the AIDS virus. He said the serum apparently was collected while <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> worked at a Mobile doctor's office while attempting to recover his professional license as a dermatologist. `` My view is simply this, the evidence indicates very strongly this defendant would like to pose a danger to the witnesses in this trial and the trial 10 years ago,'' Sessions said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told the judge the government had pursued <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> because of a `` spiteful, neurotic suicidal wife'' who lied during his trial. `` Pat's life has been dissected by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and agents of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> had a constitutional right to possess books on bombs, marijuana growing, scorpions, and identity manuals. `` There was never any threat of blowing up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office or any other target,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said `` Pat is an electronics hobbyist. None of these materials pertained to a detonating device.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Sessions' version of the case was `` fantasies of a suspicious mind.'' Sessions argued that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> planned to return to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and kill former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who co-wrote the book `` Deadly Intentions.'' The movie starred <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Biehn </PERSON> as a promising young physician who terrorized his wife after his violent, schizophrenic personality emerged. He was arrested for plotting to kill his wife after she divorced him. A photograph of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also was in <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s ammo box, Sessions said.

 An Army private who was piloting an airplane that came close to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s helicopter last year over <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was ordered to spend 30 weekends in jail Monday for making false statements about the incident. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was convicted of lying to authorities about the reason he strayed into prohibited airspace in his rented plane Aug. 13, 1987, at the same time the president was heading to his hilltop ranch north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. Despite a Probation Department recommendation of probation, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> to three years in jail for each of two counts of making false statements. Real then suspended all but 60 days of the jail time. In addition to the suspended sentence and five years' probation, the judge ordered <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> to donate 1,000 hours to charitable service. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>' jail time will begin April 9 and is not to interfere with his military service, the judge said. The maximum sentence <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> could have received was 10 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told the judge he `` can not justify or condone statements I made last August. I apologize to the government agencies involved.'' Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said he was a scapegoat for federal government mishandling of his aircraft. `` I have n't gotten a fair trial since day one because of the hysteria surrounding the near miss of Marine One,'' he said. `` There was not a near miss.'' According to the president's <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilot, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>' plane came passed about 200 feet in front of the helicopter and 150 feet below it. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> maintains his plane was no closer than 800 to 1,000 feet from Marine One. His attorney, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>, said they will appeal the sentence. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> was demoted a private's pay grade for being AWOL. He still has 18 months left to serve in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, and a passenger, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, were arrested at <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Marine helicopters, which had been escorting the president's Marine One, chased the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> to the airport, but authorities said <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> seemed unaware that he was being followed. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents he was looking for a lost contact lens in the airplane's cabin when he strayed into the prohibited airspace He also claimed he was unaware the airspace was restricted. A day later, he admitted he had lied about the lens. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, who had been absent without leave from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> since Aug. 3, 1987, said he lied because he was confused about the entire situation. `` I was trying to stay out of more trouble,'' he explained in court documents.

All seemed in order Monday when Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hosted a luncheon for Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> except for one apparent gaffe in protocol _ the silverware was from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. There was no indication that <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> or any member of his delegation noted the word `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'' etched on the bottom of the utensils. The claim of the Taiwanese government to be the official representative of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people has been a sore point with the mainland for almost four decades.

 <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Esperance </PERSON> took three of their quintuplet babies home from the hospital Monday, saying they were eager to begin family life with the in-vitro infants. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Esperance </PERSON> and their parents rode away from <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in a white limousine decorated with silver balloons as a crowd of doctors, nurses, hospital administrators and reporters watched. The babies, born Jan. 11, were the first quintuplets born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after being conceived through in-vitro fertilization, which involves fertilizing ovum in the laboratory and implanting the embryos in the womb. The other two babies, <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, who were placed on respirators at birth, remain in the hospital. They are off the respirators now and are expected to be released in a few weeks, said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Batton </PERSON>, director of newborn medicine at <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>. `` They still require special attention and monitoring,'' <PERSON> Batton </PERSON> said. `` But we expect those problems will resolve in the next couple of weeks, and we do n't anticipate any problems.'' Looking ahead to the task of raising five babies at one time, the couple said they are ready to take the infants to their new house in <LOCATION> Clarkston </LOCATION> and let them join their three other children as a family. `` We are pleased and overjoyed to have three of our babies going home,'' said <ORGANIZATION> L'Esperance </ORGANIZATION>, a corrections officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Macomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't wait to have the other two home. We'll just start getting down to being a family.'' The babies that left the hospital have gained about 3 pounds each in the eight weeks since their birth. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> weighing 4 pounds, 9 ounces; <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> weighed 6 pounds, 6 ounces; and <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> weighed 5 pounds, 14 ounces, said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, nursing director in the in-vitro fertilization program at <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies to offer certain new computerized information services, including voice storage and electronic mail. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, in a 66-page decision, refused to retreat from an earlier decision in which he said phone companies could transmit information but could not generate or manipulate the content of the information. `` It is the court's expectation that this easing of the information services restriction will avoid anticompetitive effects, and that it will at the same time bring this nation closer to the enjoyment of the full benefits of the information age,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said in his decision. Though <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s decision lifts the legal barrier to the Bell companies' offering of the new services, the companies still would need state and federal regulatory approval before they could integrate them into their networks. Industry experts and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company officials say the computer software for these services has been developed and could be offered to consumers in some parts of the country within one to two years. Voice storage and retrieval services would allow consumers to rely on the phone network for storing and retrieving messages, functions now performed by telephone answering machines. Electronic mail, a service now available in many private phone systems, allows the computer-to-computer transfer of messages. In addition, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the Bell companies can perform certain computerized `` gateway'' services such as data transmission, billing management and services that enable different computers to `` speak'' to each other. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said the decision was an important step toward making a wide range of information services available to American consumers. But both said the judge did not go far enough, and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said it will appeal the decision. `` We view this as a start, but only a start. We still are not allowed to provide content for information services,'' a <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolger </PERSON> said the company is `` particularly concerned'' that <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> is continuing to forbid the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies from electronic publishing of yellow page phone directories. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s September ruling allowed electronic white pages, but <PERSON> Bolger </PERSON> said the court's restrictions do not allow `` a sufficiently flexible and comprehensive'' electronic service for white pages directory. He also said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s decision to continue to forbid the Bell companies from getting into the content side of information services will delay the delivery of more sophisticated services _ like home banking and shopping _ to most American consumers. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a telephone analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision was a `` major breakthrough'' for the regional phone companies. He said that in the long term, `` it will be a tremendous boon to the industry,'' though in the short-term will have little effect on the companies' earninings. `` Services like this, since they are software-based, should be high-profit services and voice storage and retrieval will create new -LRB- traffic -RRB- volumes for the phone networks,'' he said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision means regulation of the industry will become more important `` to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies from overpricing local phone service to finance these new services.'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who oversees the antitrust decree that broke up the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> four years ago, has been reluctant to allow <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's offspring, the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, to compete in areas where their control of the local phone networks would put them at an advantage over competitors. Last September, he refused to lift prohibitions on the Baby Bells that prevent them from making phone equipment or offering long-distance services. In considering the restrictions on information services, however, he opened the door slightly. Monday's ruling details the information-services options now open to the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday he's going into the Super Tuesday elections as an underdog, but thinks he'll do very well nonetheless. `` I do n't have a crystal ball,'' he said when asked how many delegates he might pick up in the day's balloting. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pointed to the `` high-tech, well-financed operation'' of Democratic presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He has money; I have the message and the grass-roots approach. It will be interesting to see how these concepts play out,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made the comments in an interviw aboard his campaign plane flying from an airport rally in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> to a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. As he campaigned on the eve of Super Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has shaped up to a fight between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He also contended his message has become part of the political mainstream. `` When one takes a serious look at my positions, they are very central to the broad-based American point of view,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> visited an AIDS clinic in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and told a rally in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>: `` I'll be your friend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pledged to fight against proposals to make English the official language of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are a great nation. We can speak more than one language. ... Two-thirds of the hemisphere speaks Spanish. We should grow and speak more languages, have broader culture,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> donned a sombrero and the popular Latin-style shirt called a guayaberra as he addressed the mixed-race outdoor gathering where several people waved red <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> flags. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recalled his visit to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> of several weeks ago when he went into the broccoli fields where there are no portable lavatories for the field workers. <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION> organizer <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should get a lot of farm worker support because `` he came to help us.'' After <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s visit, she said, the state health director called a meeting to find out why the sanitary laws were not being enforced in the field. `` You need a friend in the White House,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I'm your friend in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> I'll be your friend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was accompanied by former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, who addressed the gathering in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, prominent feminist leader <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Farenthold </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> politician <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>. One man in the crowd, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said he was supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> cares about the Mexican-American problems and the poor people. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the once-bustling port of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> `` is dead'' and that he had been laid off a few years back from both Marathon and Pyramid oil companies. `` We're just about forgotten about down here and the economy is really bad. We're looking for a change,'' he said. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said the Southern region is the second-most depressed part of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed later in the day. Earlier he visited with dying men in an AIDS clinic in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Several onlookers said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will likely split the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote in this area. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who speaks fluent Spanish, has been pushing hard for the Hispanic vote and visited neighboring <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> a week ago. But county commissioner candidate <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, said, `` Speaking Spanish or marrying a Hispanic does not give you the heart of a Hispanic.'' He said that while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has done `` tremendous work in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has the heart of a Hispanic. `` He came up from the grass roots. He has not forgotten what it is to be poor,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s top police official testified at Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial Monday that he realized almost immediately <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had committed a crime in ordering the official to not cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat. `` I was in shock over what he was saying, taken aback, speechless,'' said Col. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> as angrily telling him: `` I do n't want you to help the attorney general hang me. Do n't tell him anything.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> said he had phoned the governor Nov. 15 to discuss a report that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, then a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration official, had threatened to send a former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide on `` a long boat ride'' if she did n't stop testifying before a grand jury investigating <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> campaign finances. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has denied threatening the aide, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has said he cooperated with the attorney general's office. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, whose testimony is crucial to the obstruction of justice charge against the governor, blurted out his statement regarding a crime during cross-examination by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>. Craft asked why <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, in his report on the incident, quoted the governor's words but not <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s own part of the conversation. `` Because I'm not committing a crime,'' said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. `` ... I'm not obstructing justice. `` When did you conclude that the governor's words constituted a crime?'' asked Craft. `` As I'm hearing them and reflecting on them,'' said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, adding it took him `` about two seconds'' after hanging up the phone. Craft asked <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> why he did not write down his conclusion that a crime had been committed. `` I did n't think it was necessary,'' said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. `` Anyone with a legal background could read it and see this was an obstruction of an investigation.'' Craft kept <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> on cross-examination for most of the day and said he would continue quizzing him Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> told reporters the senators were growing restless and had requested that Craft be asked to conclude. `` It's difficult for us to listen to what many of us consider repetitious quetions,'' he said. `` If that's what they do in a court of law, I'm glad I'm not a lawyer.'' At one point, Craft asked if <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> was surprised that his staff did n't tell him the governor had assigned a member of his Cabinet, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, to investigate the death threat allegation. `` No, it did n't surprise me,'' said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> is not a law enforcement officer. He's not competent to investigate it. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> works for him, and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> would n't be taken seriously anywhere on earth that I know of.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, was fired last week by acting Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who said he had publicly attacked government officials. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, the trial's seventh witness, took the stand at the start of the second week of testimony. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, has not attended the proceedings yet. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, a first-term Republican, is accused in the impeachment proceedings of obstructing the attorney general's investigation of the alleged death threat through his orders to <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, in testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment committee in January, acknowledged that he may have told <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with the investigation. However, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> contended he was not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation before his conversation with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. The governor also is accused in 23 articles of impeachment of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 in a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a recall election May 17 and a criminal trial March 22 on felony charges accusing him of concealing the $ 350,000 loan. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> described a tense, angry, fearful <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> trying to minimize the alleged threat. `` He said this was a family spat and there's nothing to it,'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> said he had called the governor as a courtesy to tell him he was taking the matter to the attorney general and was surprised by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s anger. `` His reaction was, ` Well, if you want my permission to talk to the attorney general, you ca n't have it. The answer is no.''' At one point, <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> said he was `` kind of pleading'' and told <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>: `` We always cooperate with the attorney general.'' `` He said, ` Never. Do n't give them any help.''' Earlier in the day, Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> advised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> not to grant immunity to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, who invoked Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination Friday and refused to testify. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is the target of a grand jury investigation and said it would be inappropriate to immunize him from possible future prosecution. Impeachment trial prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> said: `` We would be against giving the likes of Mr. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> a bath for all the sins he has committed.' The senators were unanimous in their rejection of immunity. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member senate is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The senators then could take another vote and bar him from holding state office again.

 Jury selection began Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> racketeering case involving Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, with 48 candidates being excused and 58 others asked to return. Last week, 94 potential jurors were excused for hardship reasons, leaving 106 who had filled out a 63-item questionnaire about their feelings and who they might know involved in the case. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motley </ORGANIZATION> excused 48 candidates based upon their answers while 58 were asked to return Tuesday, either to be requestioned or to appear for the first time. The jurors will have to decide the fate of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, his eldest son, former <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and four co-defendants, who are accused of turning the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into a `` vehicle for making illegal payments to public officials.'' The seven are charged with participating in a racketeering enterprise that allegedly looted millions of dollars in stock and cash from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor now in bankruptcy proceedings. All are charged with racketeering and conspiracy, each carrying a maximum 20-year penalty upon conviction. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> also is accused of extortion, bribe-receiving, wire fraud, perjury and filing false tax returns, and the other defendants also face various other charges. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was a small, <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop that grew into a multimillion - dollar-a-year defense contractor It rose through a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> program that allowed minority-owned firms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding. A number of federal, state and local inquiries are looking into allegations of bribery, influence peddling and other wrongdoing. Asked about one of his responses to the questionnaire, a potential juror, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siragusi </PERSON>, told Mrs. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> he had problems with the concept of programs set up especially to help minorities and women. When Mrs. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> further explained the concept to him, <PERSON> Siragusi </PERSON> said: `` Under that circumstance, I would n't consider it unfair.'' When there were no objections from defense and government attorneys, Mrs. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> ruled there was no reason to excuse <PERSON> Siragusi </PERSON>. He will be reinterviewed Tuesday. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, another jury candidate from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, was asked if he had stated on the questionnaire that he opposed programs helping minorities. `` Sure did,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` I have four children. I would n't want to see them denied a job. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was asked to return when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.

 Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> agreed to be witnesses at talks between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels, a presidential communique said Monday. The agreement by <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> official, and <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, appeared to ease the way for truce negotiations starting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, on the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> about 90 miles from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> last week said the cardinal was no longer needed as a mediator in talks with the U.S.-backed rebels. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> had served as a go-between since last November at government request. The Contras insisted the cardinal be a witness, and the talks had appeared to be in jeopardy. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sent letters this week to <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> asking them to serve as witnesses, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. No one answered the telephone at the headquarters of the Washington-based OAS. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> earlier Monday accused the government of `` preparing a unilateral show'' rather than planning for the talks. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> complained that the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had not responded to a Contra demand that <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo be present `` as witness, moderator and guarantor of the talks.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said last week that the three days of talks would be headed by his brother, <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister and one of nine members on the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>. Acceding to a Contra demand, he said the talks would be held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and suggested the Sapoa site. The Contras accepted and named <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> to head their delegation, but said the cardinal must attend. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the Contras received no word from the government about security arrangements or the agenda. The government says the talks should center on laying down arms as outlined in the regional peace plan signed last August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The rebels want a proposal outlined by the cardinal last month to be included. His agenda called for the government to grant total amnesty to political prisoners, review a mandatory military draft law, allow full press freedom and renew a dialogue with its internal opposition. In return, Contras were to accept a 30-day cease-fire. `` We have n't received any response to our position of last Thursday ... which included these items,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` We said clearly then that we accept the high-level meeting to discuss the cardinal's agenda and that we had agreed with the preliminary details of the meeting, but we have n't had a response from the Sandinista government,'' he said.

 An attorney experienced at representing the families of deceased astronauts said the settlement negotiated by the government for four Challenger families was `` woefully inadequate.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krist </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney who represented astronauts' survivors from the Apollo fire in 1967 as well as three families from the 1986 space shuttle disaster, said the four Challenger families should have received more money and would have if they had had formal legal representation The families, according to documents released Monday, are dividing the proceeds from annuities and lump sums that cost a total of $ 7.735 million. Payments from the annuities will be extended over years and may amount to much more than the actual cost. The settlement was negotiated for the families by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of the rocket blamed for the Challenger accident, paid 60 percent of the settlement and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government paid the rest. `` If they're happy, I'm happy for them,'' <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> said of the four families that settled without filing lawsuits. `` But I would never have put my stamp of approval for a settlement at the level that they received. `` They would have netted more money if they had been adequately represented,'' <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> added. Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after it was launched from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Seven astronauts, including <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> school teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, died in the accident. <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s husband, along with the wives of Challenger commander <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, mission specialist <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> all settled through the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> negotiations. However, the widow of mission specialist <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, the father of <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, and the mother of mission specialist <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> all hired <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> to file separate suits only against <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. The suits were settled out of court, but <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> said he was under court order to not discuss how much was paid. But he was blunt about the government-negotiated settlement. `` That settlement is woefully inadequate,'' he said. `` I'm suggesting that if I was representing them, I would not have allowed any of them to settle for the amount they received of less than $ 2 million a piece -LRB- per family -RRB-. However, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON>, whose husband <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> died in an Apollo spacecraft fire in 1967, said, `` It sounds like they did OK.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> said she received only $ 350,000, and she had to sue on her own for that The government, she said, `` did n't care'' and never attempted to help her or the widows of two other astronauts who died in the Apollo fire. `` I never heard from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` I thought we got an injustice done to us. I feel like we got taken. They act like they care now, but they did n't back then. `` It kinda hurts,'' she added. `` It stings that ... we never got treated like that. It hurts when I think that they're getting that much money.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and ex-husband of astronaut <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, said the documents confirm for him that <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> family was treated unfairly by the government in settlement negotiations. <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, and her estate were initially involved in settlement negotiations with the government, said <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON>, who represented the Resniks. He said the government made two offers, but neither were accepted. <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> said that because <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> was single and childless, and because the government's compensation formula was weighted heavily toward surviving spouses and children, the offer to <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s survivors was `` a quarter to a half of what they were offering the other families.'' The government has declined to contribute anything to any of the families outside the four it negotiated settlements with. Justice spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the government had made settlement offers to attorneys for the Resniks, Smiths and <ORGANIZATION> McNairs </ORGANIZATION> based on the same formula used for the other families. These were rejected, she said. After the rejections, the families either negotiated directly with <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, or filed suits or claims against the company or the government. Miss <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the government would not negotiate further with the three non-settling families because it would not enter a settlement separate from one with <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> or which exceeded the guidelines used in the other settlements. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s father and her estate recently settled privately with <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> for a sum that <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> said it was between $ 2 million and $ 3.5 million. <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> declined to confirm the amount, but he said, `` In hindsight, it was a good decision not to be part of the -LRB- government-negotiated -RRB- settlement.'' One lawsuit, filed by <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, widow of Challenger pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, remains to be settled. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did not participate in the government-negotiated settlement and a court ruled she could not sue the government. But she is suing <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> declined to come to the telephone when her <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> home was called on Monday.

 The judicial misconduct hearing of a former <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice began with a delay Monday as attorneys for a key figure in the case argued she should not have to testify. Attorneys for former <LOCATION> Chittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Judge <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that her criminal case would be damaged if she testified in the separate case of her friend and former co-worker, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was one of three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices accused of allowing their personal relationships with Wheel to interfere with their judicial duties. The charges filed in January 1987 by the state <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> has retired since the charges were filed. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> has died and the charges against <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> were dropped and he remains on the court. The scandal threw the state's highest court into turmoil. The justices refused Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>'s request that they step aside, but they did disqualify themselves from all cases involving people connected with the case. The complaint alleged that the three used their clout to help Wheel, whether it was in minor matters, like writing memos endorsing suggestions she made, or major matters, like advising her while she was under criminal investigation by the state attorney general's office for allegedly padding her paycheck. Wheel was convicted on three counts of false swearing during a jury trial last month. She was accused of lying during an inquest into allegations that she submitted false pay vouchers. Wheel appeared in court briefly Monday. But she left after she and her attorneys were given one day to submit memoranda on why she should n't have to testify. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, had said he and his client welcomed the misconduct hearing, calling it <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s opportunity to defend himself publicly. But most of the first day's testimony centered on Wheel and her activities as an assistant judge. In <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s written responses to the board's original charges, he said his relationship with Wheel was strictly professional and did not go beyond `` the amicable relationship expected of judges who work together.'' But the state on Monday attempted to depict a much closer relationship between the two. Court reporter <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Giard </PERSON> described a gathering she attended at the Holiday Inn in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>. Wheel arrived with <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> on one arm and <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> on the other. `` She danced with Justice <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> that evening,'' <PERSON> Giard </PERSON> said. `` I remember looking over.'' Marks objected to much of the testimony about Wheel and her criminal case, but was overruled by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Otterman </PERSON>, the chairman of the three-member hearing panel. The retirement of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 60, from the high court leaves few options for punishment if he is found guilty of judicial misconduct. He could be reprimanded or perhaps restricted from serving on the court under a law that allows retired justices to sit on certain cases.

 `` Do n't let them tell you this is a television campaign,'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday as he raced through a final day of pre-Super Tuesday campaigning. Still, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> packed 21 television interviews into his final day of stumping before Tuesday's primaries and caucuses in 20 states _ including 14 Southern and border states. He campaigned in person Monday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> area, then traveled to an evening rally in the <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> before a scheduled flight back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` If we can emerge from Super Tuesday with the lead in terms of delegates, we'll be on our way to the nomination,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> kicked off the day of campaigning in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, perhaps his most solid base of support in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. At a senior citizens rally, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the valued endorsement of 74-year-old <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, who has a reputation in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for being able to get out the vote. `` You have come out to listen to the man who will be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. She spoke of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' immigrant roots, something he had in common with many of those at the rally. `` My mother would have said he's a mensch,'' she said, referring to the Yiddish word for good man. `` He's a person of integrity who gets things done.'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, a former ward organizer for the late <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, met with several of the presidential candidates but decided on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after a straw poll of the residents of her condominium complex. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveled from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to attend a strawberry festival and also marched in a parade with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> at his side on Monday. He planned to vote in his hometown of <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, Tuesday morning, spend the day at his <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> office and then fly to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to begin campaigning for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. Throughout his Southern campaign swing, nearly all of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stops have come in areas where he is expected to win The strategy seems to be to reinforce areas of strength rather than seek new support. `` There are only so many hours in a day _ you ca n't go everywhere,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has repeatedly said. Asked whether the Super Tuesday primaries were a flop in attracting moderate and conservative Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` It's not been a flop for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I do n't understand what the labels mean.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not talked much about his opponents. He has continued to criticize Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, seen by many as his principal rival, but such comments have only come with prompting from reporters. He said he is worried that the negative campaigning between him and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is hurting the chances for the Democratic party in November. In response to a barb from <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> criticizing the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacks, he said, `` No, I do n't think I've impugned his integrity.'' Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 20 protesters were arrested outside <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Statehouse office on trespassing charges as they staged a sit-in to demand an immediate increase in welfare benefits. Most of the protesters went limp when told to leave the building, so police had to lift them into nearby elevators. `` While he's out stumping, our kids are starving,'' one protester shouted.

 A woman told authorities Monday that she threw her housemate's missing 7-month-old daughter into the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but police said they did n't know whether to believe the retarded woman. Divers aided by tracking dogs searched the chilly river for the blue-eyed infant, who disappeared Sunday from a row house near <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> State Prison. At dusk Monday, the search was suspended indefinitely. The 30-year-old woman was in police custody Monday but had not been charged, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON>. When police first questioned her Sunday, the woman said a man had knocked her down, kidnapped the toddler and driven off, <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> said. Then she said the man tossed the baby into the river. After further questioning, she said the baby fell off her lap into the river, <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> said. `` She admitted this morning that she threw the baby in the river yesterday,'' <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> said. `` They do n't know really whether to believe her or not because of her diminished mental capacity.

According to police, the woman asked the baby's mother, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinn </PERSON>, for permission to play with the baby Sunday morning. Ms. <PERSON> McGuinn </PERSON> gave her approval, but said the woman had to remain in the living room. However, the woman apparently took the child from the house while the mother was asleep, <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> said.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday `` the person that clearly wins Super Tuesday is going to be the nominee of the party'' as he coasted on polls that gave him a big lead in most of the 17 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contests. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped short of forecasting a sweep on Tuesday. `` You always wish for that but I certainly would never predict that. It's too much for anyone to expect,'' he said earlier in the day. At his last public appearance of the day, in <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, the vice president said he was `` optimistic but not overconfident.'' Asked what he'd do if he did n't win Super Tuesday, he replied: `` I'll have to do what I did when I got kicked in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ get up off the canvas, go out and fight hard.'' After his third-place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went on to a solid win in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary eight days later. In a two-hour stop at <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, he told a rally that Super Tuesday constitutes `` the most historic political event in modern political history.'' `` It's critical,'' he said. `` The person that clearly wins Super Tuesday is going to be the nominee of the party and I think the next president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, introduced by Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> at the rally, later toured the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> and Engineering facility at the airport and took a moment to turn a wrench on an engine. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared tired at a 15-minute news conference following a brisk walking tour of the sprawling facility. The vice president dismissed the possibility of a brokered convention. `` We're talking about victory and he's talking about brokering something,'' he said. `` I do n't see it happening. I think there are so many events that I think the Republican nominee will be determined before the convention.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about negative ads that he called `` comparative'' spots criticizing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` When attacked, you'll see some retaliation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But when you look at the totality and how it all came about, I think people understand that a person has a right to, in a laser-like fashion, go after them. I think actually the factual back-up of those ads is pretty irrefutable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former oilman, said he feels `` compatible with the base of this state.'' But he said he can not support a tax on imported oil as a means of shoring up the ailing domestic energy business. `` I was in the oil business, and I remember what it was like to have government controls, allocations of markets and regulation. And who hated it the worst? The oil industry,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That also has an artificial, inflationary built-in premise to it. Everybody's costs go up. It's like any other tax. And I'm opposed to raising taxes The industry is split on the oil import fee. I do n't happen to be in favor of it. I think what I propose, including a tax credit for exploration ... is the way to go.''

 The federal government insisted Monday that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had had no serious disagreements with its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies about disarmament at an alliance summit last week. `` Attempts ... to fabricate disagreements on basic questions between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> and its allies ... find a basis neither in the proceedings nor in the results of the summit,'' said a communique. It said Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> determined at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, that the alliance will `` concentrate on working out a comprehensive -LRB- disarmament -RRB- concept.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> assumed from the talks that `` work within the alliance will proceed smoothly, and be finished at the latest within a year,'' said the statement read to reporters by government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>. It also said there should not be attempts to `` artifically create pressures'' on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to make a quick decision on the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons. That remark appeared to be aimed at Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who told the summit that the alliance would soon have to think seriously about modernizing its aging short-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had resisted demands at the summit for a stronger <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> position on the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons, which have a range of up to 300 miles. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to postpone the scheduled modernization of those weapons and to begin negotiations with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> alliance on reducing short-range nuclear arsenals. Monday's statement repeated <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s position that he does not favor total removal of nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but wants a reduction and parity in conventional and nuclear arms by both <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials have said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be the main battleground in a European war because it borders <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

 Prosecutors Monday sought a one-month delay in Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial for allegedly concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, while defense lawyers said the charges should be dismissed. <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he would rule on the delay motion, which was opposed by the defense, Wednesday or Thursday. He did not say when he would rule on a series of defense motions brought Monday. Delays in pretrial procedures sought by the defense have left too little time for prosecutors to prepare, said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON>. He sought to change the trial starting date from March 22 to April 21. `` The governor's political agenda has no place in this courtroom,'' <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. `` He wants a speedy trial. We want a trial after the rules have been complied with.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> argued against a delay in the trial, adding, `` We want to resolve this matter and put it behind us.'' In an indictment handed up Jan. 8, the governor was charged with six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents in his failure to disclose a $ 350,000 campaign loan. His brother and 1986 campaign manager, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, faces three similar counts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial went into its second week Monday, and he also faces a May 17 recall election. Defense attorneys filed a series of motions Monday seeking: _ Dismissal or a new determination of the charges' validity, on several grounds including a claim that people who had a definite stance on the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> recall movement were unfairly excluded from the grand jury. The motion said the indictments should be dismissed `` because both those who favored the recall and those who opposed the recall were blanketly excluded from the grand jury without any regard'' to their ability to make a fair decision. _ Dismissal of the charges on grounds the Mechams were victims of selective prosecution. The motion claimed that other public figures, including state lawmakers such as former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and current <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, were not prosecuted when it was found that they had omitted items from their financial disclosure statements. `` Not only was Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> not given a written opportunity to file an amended return, his protestations of oversight and avowals of no criminal intent fell upon deaf ears,'' the motion said. `` Why? Because the political turmoil surrounding his nine months in office threatened to destroy the power and influence the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had spent more than 20 years nurturing and cultivating.'' _ A change of venue because of massive pretrial publicity, and separate questioning of prospective jurors in an effort to see that they are not biased. _ Separate trials for <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who now are scheduled to be tried together. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> also took under advisement a defense motion to dismiss two of the counts against <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and four of the counts against the governor. The defense claimed the grand jury did not have jurisdiction to bring those charges.

 A judge Monday refused to dismiss an indictment or delay the murder trial of a former state trooper accused of killing a fellow officer in her patrol car. Circuit Judge <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> rejected the defense motions as jury selection opened in the trial of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, 33, who is charged with shooting <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, 31, three times in the head at close range. Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>'s body was found Oct. 12 in her patrol car near a rural <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> church. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has said Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> was the first female state trooper in the nation to be slain on duty. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> attended her funeral and was charged in the case later.

Jury selection was expedited Monday when the judge declined to grant a defense motion to question potential jurors individually rather than have members of the jury pool answer general questions put to all.

<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government withheld nearly $ 20,000 belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and its employees when they turned in their money in a currency exchange, an embassy source said Monday. The source, who spoke on condition he not be further identified, said the embassy turned 208 million old cordobas in to the government in exchange for new ones in accordance with last month's economic measures The total, which included private money and embassy funds, was worth about $ 20,800. The government last month created a new cordoba worth 1,000 times more than the old one and pegged it at 10 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The government set an exchange limit of 10 million in cordobas per person or institution, or the equivalent of $ 1,000. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was given $ 1,000, and the rest was withheld. According to the new law, the remainder should be put in a bank account, where it is converted to the new currency but frozen. An embassy spokesman said Monday the embassy had no information whether that occurred. A <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said she had no information on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> account, but confirmed that the money should have been put in an account. The embassy source said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> asked for proof that the cordobas turned over by the Americans were obtained legally in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Exchange houses issue receipts for dollars turned into cordobas. The government did not require such receipts from individuals changing their currency. `` I do n't know if we have receipts for everybody,'' the embassy source said. `` I know I always throw mine out.''

The papers transferring ownership were signed Monday afternoon, according to <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. Last month, after marathon bargaining, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s 10 unions agreed to concessions required by the new owner, and the last of the unions officially ratified the concessions Sunday. `` The rescue of the Post is nothing less than an historic moment,'' <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said in a statement, thanking the unions and employees `` for their heroic efforts.'' Union leaders will sign formal papers Tuesday and meet with <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> on Thursday to `` get to know each other,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents eight of the 10 unions. `` We're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> bought the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper for $ 37.6 million from <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, who sold the paper to comply with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations barring ownership of two media outlets in the same city. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> owns <ORGANIZATION> WNYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, known to moviegoers as Divine, the campy, 300-pound transvestite star of such films as `` Pink Flamingos'' and `` Hairspray,'' died in his sleep in a hotel room, the coroner's office said Monday. He was 42. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coroner </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said investigators went to the Regency Plaza Hotel on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> was a guest when he died during the night. `` The cause of death is under investigation,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> apparently died of asphyxiation, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PMK </ORGANIZATION> Public Relations. `` He was finally getting respect within the industry,'' said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s manager, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>. `` He was getting the legitimate screen and television offers that showed the industry had finally accepted him as the very good character actor he always knew he was.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> got a medical checkup last Friday and was declared in excellent health, other than his weight, `` which has been a constant problem throughout his life,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, star of the latest <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters-directed </PERSON> movie `` Hairspray,'' was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to appear in an episode of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> television series `` Married ... With Children.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> was to have appeared in that role dressed as a man, but he was best known to movie fans as the bizarre female impersonating star of such cult classic films as `` Pink Flamingos,'' `` Lust In The Dust,'' `` Polyester'' and `` Female Trouble.'' The Divine character was garishly made up and outrageously chesty, as well as loud, raucous and foul-mouthed. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s appearance made the first Waters films a favorite for after-midnight showings at arty cinema houses But with each film, both <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> and Waters found a wider audience, and `` Hairspray'' has enjoyed a good following as well as flattering reviews, coming in No. 16 this weekend in the box office with $ 577,258 at 79 theaters for a $ 7,307 per screen average. In the film, set in the early 1960s, he plays the mother of a chubby teen-age girl who becomes a teen television dance star and pioneer integrationist. Dressed as a man, he also plays a segregationist television station manager. In another non-transvestite role, <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> played a <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Greenstreet-type character in the 1985 film `` Trouble In Mind.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> said in a 1985 interview that he grew up fat and taunted by classmates in <LOCATION> Lutherville </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The only son of a businessman and his wife, <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> told an interviewer he had a fantasy life revolving around female movie stars and dreams of becoming a celebrity. One of his few friends from high school was Waters, whose obsession with trashy movies nearly matched <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s fantasies of celebrity. Waters began casting his friend in bizarre roles. In the 1972 `` Pink Flamingos,'' Divine was introduced as `` the filthiest person alive.'' `` The character is a real person,'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> once said of Divine. `` Sometimes she's just too bold, but she has socially redeeming qualities, no matter what she does. She's her own person and a lot of people like that. `` The camp element is something out of the ordinary, this big man playing a sexy woman.'' Besides film roles, <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> also used the Divine persona in a nightclub act. He is survived by his mother and father, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, who now live in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said.

 Kansas Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, on a last-ditch campaign swing through <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Monday, all but conceded Super Tuesday to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ but said he was n't giving up the fight for the Republican presidential nomination. `` We know that we wo n't be the front-runner after Super Tuesday, but it's not over after Super Tuesday,'' he told a crowd of about 80 supporters during a brief rally at the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Regional </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We're going to win in November.'' Earlier, in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears strong in the South but `` there may be some surprises'' and Republicans should nominate someone who will win the general election. `` We do n't want to lose the White House by nominating the wrong person,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said his race against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for Republican votes in the big round of balloting Tuesday was tight in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` We're moving very quick in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state looks pretty good,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a news conference at Will <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are some opportunities in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` The other states?

We do n't want to lose the White House by nominating the wrong person.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> displayed a copy of Monday's <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> -RRB- Post-Herald, which published a survey saying that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the strongest candidate among <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary voters, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is stronger among voters of all parties. `` I attract a lot of Democrats and independents,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in commenting on the newspaper's poll, which surveyed 1,131 voters in 14 Southern states. `` I do n't think I scare anybody off. I think I attract a lot of people.''

I'm not sure that's going to work,'' he said. `` But what could happen is that they might select the weakest Republican, so they might get a consolation prize that way.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side, he said that `` this is a race between <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` I would invite friends and supporters of -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. -RRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to take a look at our candidacy and maybe join us Tuesday night at polling places around the state,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was joined at the news conference by <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> and several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> who are backing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is the best-qualified candidate to deal with the energy and agriculture industries vital to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and predicted a victory on Tuesday. `` You've been to this state many times and have been warmly received. I hope and expect you'll be warmly received on Tuesday night as well,'' <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, saying <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> football teams do n't have much success in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said: `` It's about time you give <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> a break, and give <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a break by voting for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tomorrow.''

 A federal appeals court Monday halted work on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to relocate the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a project that has been opposed by environmental groups. In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to stop preliminary work on the $ 272 million project until an appeals board reviews a state permit, chiefly on the issue of how to dispose of contaminated sediment from harbor dredging. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shorelines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> began a final week of hearings Monday on water quality and development permits for the project. A decision is scheduled in May or June. Four votes are needed on the six-member board to reject the state permit. `` We fully expect that when the project receives full review ... there will be significant modifications,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, a lawyer for six environmental groups that oppose the dredging. The ruling means `` the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> must comply with state environmental laws, just like everybody else,'' he said. Also opposing the project is the Tulalip Indian tribe, whose fishing grounds include <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> March </PERSON>, a spokesman for the home-port project, said he would study the ruling to see what options the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to relocate the Nimitz and 12 support ships in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Puget Sound, hoping to have the first ships arrive in 1992. The principal dispute is over the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to dredge about 3.4 million cubic yards of sediment from the harbor and dispose of it in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> near crab beds at depths of 310 to 430 feet. About a third of the sediment is contaminated with heavy metals and organic compounds, the court said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to `` cap'' the contaminated dredging with a lawyer of clean sediment. But the court said the technique is experimental and has been criticized by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which said the method had failed both times it had been tested at comparable depths.

Police said they were searching <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> and adjacent <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> territory for a car believed connected with a bomb attack the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> allegedly planned at the governor's residence during the ceremonial changing of the guard, which hundreds of spectators attend. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, just transferred from duty in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, were scheduled to participate in the ceremony Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, gangs of youths charged into the streets Monday afternoon, throwing firebombs at buses, vans and trucks in violence that continued into the evening, police reported. Bus service in Roman Catholic areas was halted after several buses were set afire. A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice, said he did not know if the attacks were a reaction to the reports from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The two men and a woman were shot by men described by witnesses as wearing jeans and speaking with British accents. The British soldiers were believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>, an elite undercover unit that has been involved in previous actions against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> of the 220-man <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> police force said officers were looking for a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> automobile but did not believe it contained explosives. The independent Spanish news agency <ORGANIZATION> Europa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> quoted police in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, however, as saying the car might contain explosives intended for an attack Tuesday. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> acknowledged in his remarks to Parliament that the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members were on foot and unarmed when they were killed Sunday afternoon while heading for the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> frontier. He said they were challenged and `` made movements which led security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.'' `` There is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterday's events a dreadful terrorist act has been averted,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said `` The three people killed were actively involved in the planning and attempted execution of that act.'' The foreign secretary also said a fourth <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerilla `` recently crossed into <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> and is thought to have carried out a reconnaissance for an act of terrorism.'' Gasoline pumps at the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> service station where two were shot down bore several bullet holes police had marked with blue arrows. About 100 hundred yards up the avenue, where the third fell, white marks on a large tree indicated more bullet holes. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the soldiers found keys to a second car on the body of one of the men. That car, a red <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiesta </ORGANIZATION> registered in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, was found parked in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linea </LOCATION> de la Concepcion on the Spanish side of the gate separating this 2.25-square-mile limestone rock from the Spanish mainland. In the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, police found three false passports, an alarm clock, insulating tape, gloves, wire and a set of keys to the third car, which police are searching for, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. He said reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> contained several hundred pounds of explosives were unfounded. <ORGANIZATION> Europa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members left the <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> near the Convent to make sure there would be space for the third car, which they planned to park on Tuesday rigged as a as a car bomb. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> identified the dead as <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, who served 10 years in prison for bombing a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> hotel; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, all of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The men had been arrested on charges of possessing explosives. Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, the governor and commander-in-chief of British forces in the colony, issued a statement praising the 30,000 residents and said the people of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> showed `` their determination to stand alongside all British people in their fight against international terrorism.'' <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladolid </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> state security, said in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police spotted the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members on the southern Costa del Sol more than a month ago and told British authorities, who requested surveillance but no intervention. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading daily, said they left <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> a week ago, probably for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, `` but planned to return to <LOCATION> Malaga </LOCATION> and did.'' It quoted Spanish police as saying they followed the trio `` right up to the gate'' of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. In Parliament, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> expressed gratitude to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> authorities, `` without whose invaluable assistance the outcome might have been very different.'' <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> is a sore point in relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which claims sovereignty over the rock it ceded in 1713 after losing the War of Spanish Succession.

 Bank accounts containing what's left of the fortune donated to save liver-transplant patient <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> were frozen Monday after a judge was told the dead boy's mother had spent some of the charity money on jewelry, clothes and furniture, a state attorney said. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> appointed a curator to manage the estate in accordance with a petition filed by state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> and State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, has spent more than half of the money donated to her 7-year-old son, who died last year while awaiting a fourth transplant, the petition said. Among the donors was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who like many others was touched by news reports of the theft of funds raised by <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s classmates He gave $ 1,000. When <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> last April 29, an account in his name had accumulated $ 509,913, the petition said. The account balance on Feb. 17 was $ 239,288, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstein </PERSON>, assistant state attorney and chief of the economic criminal division. As recently as Jan. 19, 1988, $ 25,000 had been withdrawn from the fund, `` thereby further depleting the assets of the estate,'' the petition said. `` Based upon an examination of bank records, at least $ 47,000 appears to have been expended by <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> on jewelry, clothing, furniture, housing expenses, an automobile and automobile expenses, these funds having been assets of this estate,'' it said. There was no further breakdown of the expenditures in the petition. Asked about the allegations in the petition, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said: `` Why do they not say that money went to charity? Why do they not say that some of that money was assigned to me personally? ... How come they do n't say how much of that money went to kids?'' She said she had already planned to use the money that was frozen to help two ailing children who are awaiting transplants, one from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the other from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and would go to probate court to straighten out the dispute. `` There are two children that have less than six months to live, and that's what I want to do with the money,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is being sued by <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for failing to pay $ 261,189 of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s $ 424,302 bill. In refusing to pay the balance, Ms. DeSillers charged the hospital with giving poor care to her son and threatened to file a malpractice suit. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> and her lawyer, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, said last month they would refuse to pay a $ 1,000 state fine for allegedly violating <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> charity laws. She said through <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> that she had never asked the public to donate money and she was not legally a charity. She also said she was entitled to the money as <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s sole heir. After <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s death, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> created the foundation to assist other children in need of organ transplants. She returned to the limelight when it was learned that the formerly unemployed public relations agent was living in a luxury apartment building and driving a BMW equipped with a telephone. She denied squandering any of the donations, explaining that the car was second-hand, the car telephone was a gift and the apartment doubled as her office. The petition filed by <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> asked that <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s estate be frozen `` to prevent additional assets of the estate ... from being wasted and to protect persons interested in the estate, including creditors.'' `` Immediate and irreparable injury will result to assets of the estate ... if <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is permitted to withdraw the funds,'' the petition said. Attorney <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Geivers </PERSON> was appointed estate curator, <PERSON> Kerstein </PERSON> said.

 The first inmates arrive Tuesday at Camp Sauble for 90-day terms of hard labor and military-style discipline that officials hope will keep the young offenders out of the prison system. It is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s first experiment with a probationary program that has caught on in other states. The so-called `` boot camp,'' one of about 15 such programs in seven states, is a last stop for young, first-time felons who otherwise would have been sent to prison for at least a year. `` A lot of the people put into the corrections system have never been held accountable for anything in their lives, and as a result, have never had any pride,'' Deputy Warden <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` Here, we hope they'll leave with a sense of accomplishment because they'll be held accountable for everything they do.'' `` Everything'' includes how their hair is trimmed to how their beds are made and how their uniforms are buttoned. The first dozen of an eventual 156 probationers are expected by the end of the week at Camp Sauble, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> minimum-security work camp tucked away in <ORGANIZATION> Manistee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Inmates must be between the ages of 17 and 25 and never have been in the prison system before. The inmates will rise at 5 a.m. each day and prepare for an inspection of bunks and uniforms. After breakfast, they will fall in for an exercise period before heading out for about seven hours of unpaid work in and around <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Before dinner, there will be more physical training and calisthenics, and after dinner inmates will attend academic or substance-abuse treatment programs. One hour will be allowed nightly to write letters or watch television news before lights go out at 10 p.m. Military protocol will be enforced strictly. Inmates will be required to stand at attention when in the presence of an instructor and will receive demerits for violations. If an inmate commits a serious crime, such as the assault of a staff member or fellow inmate, or if he receives three misconduct charges, he will be returned to the judge who sentenced him, likely resulting in a prison sentence. If a candidate passes the program successfully, he will be freed on probation. Some say the program is an effective way to jolt first-time offenders into straightening out. Others claim it is a ploy by politicians who want their constituents to believe they're tough on crime. One such critic is <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of National Alternatives to Incarceration. `` The people in these programs are usually from families where yelling and screaming and putting down are day-to-day occurrences, so a program like this is n't going to scare them,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose non-profit organization, based in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, studies programs that keep offenders out of prison.

 Three Palestinian guerrillas seized a commuter bus Monday and held nuclear plant workers hostage, killing three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians and wounding nine before police shot the hijackers to death, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility, saying in a statement released in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, that the hijacking was part of `` escalating military action'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The statement said the guerrillas launched the attack from within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and did not infiltrate from a neighboring country. Israeli army officials said the guerrillas infiltrated from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and held 10 women and one man hostage for about three hours. The bus was seized as it shuttled workers of the top-secret <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION> nuclear plant. In the occupied territories, at least 12 Arabs were shot Monday during clashes with Israeli troops, and the army said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters hurled a grenade at troops, wounding one soldier slightly in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION>. Also, more than 20 Arab tax collectors in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> submitted mass resignations after underground leaflets called for Palestinians to quit working for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military administration. An army official says the resignations are not final. Israeli analysts said escalating violence could harden the position of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which has not accepted the peace initiatives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, that Monday's bus victims `` were killed for mothing else but for their being Jewish, residents of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' In an anonymous telephone call to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a man said the hijacking was the work of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s Force 17, a Palestinian commando group linked to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. If the commandos did come from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, it would mark the eighth infiltration into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since late November. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the infiltrations and the three months of violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were part of a PLO strategy. `` These are the same people who incite violence in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories. We shall not tire from fighting them,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> condemned the hijacking and noted `` with sadness that at a time when the majority ... are looking for a peaceful solution of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, terrorists emerge to attack the innocents.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, a leader of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s doves, said the hijacking was an indication of why <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to deal with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` This shows exactly why the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a disaster for both Arabs and Jews,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, the armed forces chief of staff, said the guerrillas crossed the lightly guarded border from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and he criticized <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> authorities for not doing more to stop such infiltrations. Army officials said the terrorists were armed with fragmentation grenades, two Soviet Kalashnikov assault rifles and a Swedish-made <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> submachine gun. The Arab gunmen first seized a small military vehicle at about 7 a.m. near the <LOCATION> Nafha </LOCATION> prison, a few miles from the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The guerrillas, riding in the captured vehicle, went on a rampage along the highway, shooting at passing cars and trucks and wounding one Israeli man in the leg, police officials said. Police chased the car and shot out a tire, forcing the guerrillas to abandon the vehicle, police said. The guerrillas then seized the red-and-white bus carrying workers to the <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION> nuclear plant, during which the bus' driver and all but 11 passengers escaped. Police later stopped the vehicle by barricading the road near the Aroer junction. The Arab trio was headed toward <LOCATION> Beersheva </LOCATION>, away from the nuclear facility, when they seized the bus, indicating the facility was not the target of the guerrillas. The guerrillas gave Israeli authorities one hour to produce an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official and free jailed Palestinians. `` They presented an ultimatum. If their demand were not met within half an hour, including the release of detainees and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorists, they will -LRB- kill -RRB- the hostages,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, the army's southern commander. Moments later, <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said, the guerrilla leader fatally shot in the chest <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ran </PERSON>, 39, the father of three children. `` When they fired and executed one of the hostages and fired at the women who were in the bus, despite our promises that we will not harm them ... we stormed the bus and killed the three terrorists,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. He said the assault by anti-terror police lasted about one minute. <PERSON> Rina </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiratzky </PERSON>, 31, the mother of two, and <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yair </PERSON>, 46, the mother of four, were fatally wounded when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers stormed the bus. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said an investigation showed the shots were fired by the Arab guerrillas.

In January, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he would visit the Soviet Union only if he could meet with Roman Catholics around the country. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> has let it be known he would like to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, especially former Polish territories in the Soviet Lithuanian republic that has a large Polish minority and where the Catholic faith is quite strong.

The Soviet invitation reflects a turnaround since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power three years ago.

 An unemployed handyman waived his right to a jury Monday and his trial began on charges of killing seven women and leaving their bodies to rot in and near his apartment. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> `` Marty'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s decision came as Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> prepared to begin jury selection. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> then entered pleas of innocent to seven counts each of murder, voluntary manslaughter and abuse of a corpse. The judge, after determining <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 28, understood the charges, ordered the lawyers to begin presenting their cases. Both sides waived opening statements. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> moved for admission of all testimony and documents from a monthlong pretrial suppression hearing, including a confession <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> made to police, admitting strangling the seven women during sex. Latrone granted the request. During the pretrial hearing, defense attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON>, contending his client is mentally incompetent, sought unsuccessfully to suppress the confession. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> argued the confession was made in violation of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s constitutional rights and after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> allegedly was beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> surrendered to police at his mother's urging Aug. 16 after a weeklong manhunt that started when he was evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench. A police search uncovered the rotting bodies in <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s bedroom and leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment house. In the confession, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told police the bodies began piling up in his bedroom and he began having problems with maggots. He also told of his difficulty sleeping during the day because of birds on the roof outside his apartment, picking at human remains. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> has indicated that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s defense will be insanity. The first witness called by the prosecution, acting Medical Examiner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherman </PERSON>, said all seven deaths were homicides but said it was impossible in most cases to determine the cause of death because of decomposition.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers in tanks and jeeps patrolled the main streets and poorer areas of the capital Monday to block further protests against the rising cost of living. President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> summoned his advisers to discuss ways of controlling inflation, a major factor in recent unrest in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation of more than 6.5 million people. Protesters burned tires early Monday during a 24-hour strike in five low-income sectors of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>. Three days of clashes last week between protesters and soldiers left one person dead and many businesses damaged. More than 300 people were arrested. The previous week, three people were killed and eight injured in protests in eight of the country's 26 provinces. Support seemed to be dwindling for a general strike called for Wednesday to demand lower prices for basic commodities, wage increases for public and private workers and better public services. `` We are willing to talk and hold sincere discussions with the authorities to solve the conflict as long as they manifest their sincere willingness to satisfy our demands,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Virtudes </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. The group called for the general strike and organized earlier strikes in the last few weeks that shut down many parts of the capital. Labor groups opposed the strike, but promised to support it if it takes place. They want either a later strike or talks among the government, unions and business community to try to solve the economic problems. The main opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is also against the strike, although left-wing political parties support it. <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> said Sunday he would meet with his agricultural advisers, merchants and business people to develop a plan to implement price controls. Shortages of many goods, including milk, have become prevalent. A private economist estimated the February inflation rate at about 5 percent and predicted a 50 to 60 percent rate for 1988 if that continued. Private sources have estimated inflation in 1987 at around 30 percent, although the government's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> maintains it was closer to 16 percent.

 The author of a petition on religious freedom in communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that was signed by about 300,000 people has been arrested and charged with slander, an emigre source said Monday. The London-based emigre publishing firm <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navratil </PERSON> was accused of committing `` slander of a state organ and of a public organization.'' Conviction is punishiable by up to one year in prison. The exact targets of the purported slander were not spelled out. <PERSON> Navratil </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist from a village in <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>, was one of 16 people detained over the weekend in advance of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> pilgrimage in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Sunday. Dissident sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Navratil </PERSON> was detained Friday morning.

 The presidential candidates are suggesting that their rivals are disloyal, hypocritical, ineffective, inexperienced and underhanded in a slew of negative television ads that reflect the demands of a compressed, high-stakes campaign season. Instead of inspirational biographies and upbeat messages, viewers in many of the 20 states holding Super Tuesday contests are seeing `` attack ads'' that quickly escalate from issue-oriented criticism to personal digs cutting to the bone of campaign themes and identities. Analysts give numerous reasons for the unusually early predominance of sharply negative television ads. Chief among them are the central role of TV, the candidates' needs to differentiate themselves from their rivals and the do-or-die nature of Super Tuesday for several campaigns.

 When publisher <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Herralde </PERSON> saw novels bearing his Anagrama Logo in all three bookstores on <LOCATION> Lanzarote </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, he knew things were looking up for serious books in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` Eight or nine years ago, it would have been impossible to find good novels and essays in bookstores in provincial towns, let alone on a small island in the Canaries,'' he said. `` It makes me optimistic about the future of Spanish publishing.'' <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lluis </PERSON>, director of the year-old publishing company <ORGANIZATION> Circe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ediciones </ORGANIZATION>, agrees that now is the time for quality books in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` There's a new, discriminating reading public that wants more than the pulp best sellers,'' she said. `` They've read <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Yourcenar </PERSON>, and they do n't want to settle for less.'' The increased interest in quality books in a country where newspaper readership is the lowest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> comes more than a decade after the demise of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s dictatorship and his 36 years of cultural and intellectual repression. The change has been fairly sudden. It is due in part to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 1986 entry into the European Common Market which has broadened many horizons <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Herralde </PERSON> also credited the newfound market to a decline in ideological topics and obscure experimental writing by some authors, and a return to the narrative _ both in Spanish and foreign literature. Those in the publishing industry, centered mainly in this northeastern port city, say Spaniards are now looking beyond their borders, learning foreign languages and reading good books. A 1985 study initiated by the Ministry of Culture on Spanish cultural behavior said that although 80 percent of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> households possessed books, mainly encyclopedias or technical manuals, only 41 percent read any of them. The study also showed that the Spanish reading public is heavily concentrated in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> is the capital _ the the most developed and educated regions of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The illiteracy rate is 7.4 percent in a population of 36.8 million, third highest in the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. Results also revealed that fewer than 11 percent of Spaniards ever set foot inside a library. `` Many people are still afraid to go inside bookstores or libraries because they think they're only for intellectuals,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripoll </PERSON>, producer of `` Entrelineas'' -LRB- `` Between the Lines'' -RRB-, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> state TV's new literary program. `` That's why so many of the books sold in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> are purchased at corner newsstands.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Herralde </PERSON> pointed out that the biggest single bookseller in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ with items ranging from how-to manuals to poetry collections _ is <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Corte </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingles </PERSON>, the country's only department store chain. Translations of foreign works _ primarily <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and English books _ make up about 70 percent of the lists of <LOCATION> Anagrama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Circe </PERSON> and other quality houses. The other 30 percent is devoted to the works of established or new Spanish authors. Five years ago <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Herralde </PERSON>, a 52-year-old former industrial engineer, took a chance on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Toole </PERSON>'s `` A Confederacy of Dunces,'' a cult novel published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when the unknown author's mother brought the manuscript to a publisher after his suicide. The book earned the author a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1981. The Spanish edition has gone into 22 printings and has sold 100,000 copies. The translation into Catalan, a language spoken by more than 5 million people in the northeastern part of the country, is due out in April. <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Raola </PERSON>, director of the Catalan publishing house Editorial Portic, said many Spanish-reading Catalans preferred to wait to read a translation of a foreign novel in their own language, resulting in a similar upsurge in Catalan-language publishing. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, 38,814 titles were published in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1986 of which 7,483 were novels and essays. The average press run for a Spanish novel is between 3,500 and 4,000 copies. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Azua </PERSON>'s `` Diary of a Humiliated Man'' has gone into its third printing at <LOCATION> Anagrama </LOCATION> in three months following its publication in December after winning the firm's coveted Herralde literary award. Chilean author <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>'' and `` Belle du Seigneur'' by French author <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> have been jockeying for first place on the best-seller list of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION> for the past six months. Five of the 10 top-selling books on the list are by Spanish authors. The most successful Spanish novel this century is <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gironella </PERSON>'s `` Cypresses Believe in God,'' set in the years leading up to the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. Since its publication in the late 1950s, the book has sold over 4 million copies. The burst of interest in quality fiction has led <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> publishing giants to set up smaller collections devoted to serious fiction and essays, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Herralde </PERSON> said. And the nationwide Readers' Circle book club began including quality foreign and domestic fiction several years ago at the request of its 1.3 million members, according to spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentz </PERSON>.

 Pssst! Looking for unspoiled scenery, cheap extras and good local technicians for filming on location? It's still a word-of-mouth proposition, but some of the world's leading filmmakers are discovering <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s steamy jungles, vast savannahs and palm-studded beaches for shooting their exotic location shots The South American country is being promoted as a cheaper and more accessible alternative to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and a non-politicized substitute for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. British producer <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> brought Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilby </PERSON>, star of `` A Room With a View,'' to the jungles near <LOCATION> Canaima </LOCATION>, 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, in late January to film a portion of `` A Handful of Dust,'' based on the novel by <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Siritzky </PERSON> came last November to check out scenery in <LOCATION> Canaima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> for the sixth movie in the `` Emmanuelle'' series, now being shot for him by a local film group. Last October, two episodes of the TV series `` Dynasty'' were filmed here. They involve a jungle rescue. And <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> recently beat out <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to provide various beach sites for a series of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> commercials. `` For directors who are interested in the kinds of scenes shot in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, we are unbeatable: We're the cheapest, the freshest and we have good technicians,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>, a Hungarian-born Venezuelan whose company, <ORGANIZATION> Korda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION>, is undertaking the `` Emmanuelle'' project. Filmmakers attribute the growing interest in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in part to the never-ending quest by directors for something unique and untouched _ something that, ideally, no other director has used before. `` Everybody knows about <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and they're a bit tired of that so they're discovering <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s attitude toward foreign filmmakers has also changed, they say, along with the value of its currency. Successive devaluations of the bolivar since 1983 have made it possible for directors to put up actors and crewmen in three or four star hotels for $ 20 a night. Extras can be hired for $ 13 a day _ a marvelous wage in a nation where the urban minimum wage is $ 65 a month. Foreign directors say they have found local production companies fully competent for back-up work. Many Venezuelans in film were trained abroad under government scholarships. And <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s jungles are also more accessible, because they are smaller than <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin and closer to population centers. `` Our location manager said it would be easier -LRB- to film here -RRB- than work in the heart of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We had only 10 days to film. We needed good immediate facilities, good hotels and easy means of transport.'' And the government, which has been interested in promoting tourism ever since oil prices fell, is content to see the movie people come, local promoters say. However, some have found the government difficult to work with. The arts crew of `` A Handful of Dust'' could not get the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guayana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the national park in which <ORGANIZATION> Canaima </ORGANIZATION> is located, to provide the animals. So they instead had to rent parrots, monkeys and deer from a local landowner. But there's another message that Venezuelan promoters are beginning to whisper: `` Stable government, no racial problems.'' Except for the animals, some Venezuelan landscapes are dead ringers for the South African savannah. This new selling point could take on more weight as more studios, including the 120 Americans banded together in the industry pressure group <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartheid </ORGANIZATION>, seek to avoid possible commercial backlashes from filming in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` There are places here that look just like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, only we're much closer and we do n't have racial problems or a civil war,'' said <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Haiek </PERSON>, whose company, 5247 <ORGANIZATION> Producciones </ORGANIZATION>, was hired by <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> to provide everything needed locally for `` A Handful of Dust.'' 5247 Productions now hopes to get a Canadian production company to film `` Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>,'' a story set in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> instead.

 <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize and the admiration of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> with a leadership that dared break new political and social ground, including making peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The same self-assured decisiveness made the warrior president a hero to his countrymen in the early 1970s, especially after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war in which he could claim his bold moves led to an Egyptian victory over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. But in the years leading up to his assassination Oct. 6, 1981, as <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s temperament changed, many Egyptians turned against him, even though he remained widely admired abroad. Those latter years are the ones being recalled now as members of <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s family return to a courtroom March 12 for a hearing to determine whether the government can confiscate property it claims was acquired through corruption. Although the case against <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> and 10 members of his immediate family is connected only remotely to <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON>, the late president's detractors contend that <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s presidency is on trial. They contend that <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s open-door economic policy led to the kind of corrupt practices his brother was tried for and convicted of. `` Corruption increased in President <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s time,'' said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohieddin </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella of Marxists and Nasserites. `` People just grabbed money and ran away.'' Like <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohieddin </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that ended the monarchy of King <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> in 1952. The council acted under <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, republican <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s first president and <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s predecessor. During the <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> presidency, <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> allegedly amassed an illegal fortune despite later-disclosed efforts by the president to stop his brother's profiting on their relationship. His activities were so blatant that on the first anniversary of <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination by Moslem extremists, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> reportedly told him: `` Your stench has spread throughout the country. I'm not going to protect anyone.'' A little later, he was arrested and tried. <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, three sons and seven other family members were convicted on 24 counts of influence peddling, black marketeering and bribery. Their property was sequestered, and <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> and three of his sons served nine months of a one-year prison term. The new court case is for confiscation of their wealth, estimated at $ 8.2 million. `` <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> and his children were a dangerous burden on <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in his life and after his death,'' said <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> confidant who writes a regular column at the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you see they traded, and stole, and have millions, of course they used his name. ... People used to be intimidated into doing what they wanted. ... Some people say he was not responsible for his brothers but of course it affects.'' <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON>'s trial spotlighted `` infitah,'' the open-door economic policy that <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> came up with in the mid-1970s. With its loopholes, it created many Esmats, a class of the newly rich. Additionally, it created public frustration over the massive influx of flashy imports of luxury goods, from cars to designer sunglasses, that were unaffordable for most Egyptians. The policy served mainly private interests and foreign companies in joint ventures. Many wealthy businessmen, feeling <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s present economic pinch, look back with regret at <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was not being transformed from a planned to a market economy but to a supermarket economy,'' wrote <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heikal </PERSON>, a close adviser to <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> until they fell out over foreign policy. `` The disrupting effect which this transformation had on Egyptian society can hardly be exaggerated,'' <PERSON> Heikal </PERSON> wrote in `` Autumn of Fury,'' a bitter book about <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination that was banned in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for two years after its publication in 1983. In the book's introduction, <PERSON> Heikal </PERSON> said he collected much of his information from fellow prisoners after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> jailed him and 1,535 others in a crackdown on domestic dissenters a month before his death. Some watched closely to see whether the decision permitting the sale of the book would start a downgrading of <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s memory. But <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> remains an honored figure in government eyes, because the bullets that killed him did little to change the governing system he had built. His portrait remains posted on a major suburban road behind a guest house the government gave his family. His tomb in another suburb shares a place of honor with that of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s unknown soldier. The largest station of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s new subway system, the first named, is `` Sadat Station.'' Nevertheless, much of the popular local support <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> had won by making peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and his vow of `` no more war'' was eroded by the wave of arrests in September 1981. Moreover, he shut down a half-dozen Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Coptic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> publications, withdrew state recognition of Coptic Pope <PERSON> Shenouda </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and banished him to a desert monastery, thereby alienating <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 6 million Copts. A year after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON>'s trial came as a welcome change to many people in a country where authorities often turned a blind eye to dubious acts by the powerful. Eager crowds outside the courthouse cheered `` long live justice'' on hearing days, and when the verdict and sentence were read, about 300 spectators in the courtroom burst into applause. Commenting on <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s legacy after seven years, <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> said, `` The Egyptians, and not only the Egyptians but the Arab people, have started to realize that this man's view was ahead of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s thinking. He actually managed to create peace between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and to get back our land.'' In her recently published memoirs, <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s widow <PERSON> Jihan </PERSON> wistfully conceded that <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s star has not shone as brightly with his compatriots as she feels it should have. `` Someday, Egyptians will recognize what <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> did for his country and give him his rightful place in history,'' she wrote. `` With patience, I wait.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON> is n't given much chance in his candidacy for the office of president, but he's getting some attention with his idea to restore an orchard owner's benefit dating back to the French Revolution. In 1791, owners of orchards were granted the right to distill tax-free each year 2.6 gallons of eau de vie, the alcoholic beverage that is sipped after meals and called `` pousse cafe'' or `` digestif.'' The distillers would pay no tax so long as they did n't offer it for sale. The license to distill was passed on from one generation to another until 1961 when a new law canceled the right to inherit the license. Eau de vie comes in various forms, depending on the region. In <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, for example, it is made from apples and is called calvados. In <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, pears and plums are used; in the <LOCATION> Auvergne </LOCATION> region of central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> it is made from hazelnuts. `` When my mother died six months ago, I inherited her orchard,'' said <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON>, `` but the license died with her and so I can no longer make eau de vie without paying tax.'' <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON>'s bucolic campaign headquarters is his 60-acre sheep farm in the village of <LOCATION> Chezeaux </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Haut-Marne </LOCATION> department of eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. His name does not figure in the opinion polls, he has no political party machine behind him, or image advisers cultivating a presidential package for the balloting April 24 and runoff May 8. But he has been getting his message out and has already received letters of support from 500 mayors, the minimum necessary to declare his candidacy formally. `` Our method of raising support is by word of mouth,'' <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But he thinks it unlikely that he will become <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s successor in the presidency. He is simply using the elections, he said, to defend what he sees as an honorable rural tradition. Others, however, compare the lot of French eau de vie distillers to the tale of Tristan and <PERSON> Isolde </PERSON>, or the myth of the eternal return, because the argument to restore the inherited licenses resurfaces from time to time. In a country that has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the world, the abolition of the right to distill tax-free eau de vie might seem like a good thing. But <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON> disagrees. He wants to clean up the image of the `` bouilleurs de cru,'' as eau de vie makers are known. `` We want people to realize that we are not just purveyors of alcoholism,'' he said. <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON> maintains that the major distilleries are more to blame for the problem of alcoholism than farmers who make a couple of gallons out of plums or apples. According to <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON>, 2.11 million gallons of alcohol were drunk in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last year, of which just 15,840 gallons were homemade eau de vie. `` This shows how ridiculous the argument is,'' he said. `` We make less than 1 percent of the total consumption in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' Gobinot emphasizes that traditional rural skills, and therefore jobs, are disappearing as a result of the 1961 law. Only a handful of craftsmen making wooden barrels remain and the fruit trees are no longer pruned as they used to be, he said. The distiller with his `` alambic ambulant'' -LRB- mobile still -RRB-, going from village to village in <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> to turn apples into calvados, was once a familiar figure. `` The farmer who picks his own fruit is proud to distill his own eau de vie,'' <PERSON> Gobinot </PERSON> said. `` He does everything himself and is making a natural product. `` I drink very little myself. But I take great pleasure in offering a glass of friendship when people come to my house.''

<TEXT>
 In less than a generation, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has slashed its infant death rate to the lowest in the world, thanks to a formula that combines intensive prenatal care with government policy. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also has one of the world's highest abortion rates, which could help in keeping figures low for the infant-death rate. The officially reported infant mortality rate, in any case, has fallen from a high of more than 60 deaths per 1,000 in the years after World War II to 4.9 per 1,000 in 1987 _ meaning that of every 1,000 babies born, 995.1 will live to their first birthdays. No other nation comes close. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lags far behind with a rate of 10.6 per 1,000. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> rank second behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with 6.0, according to 1986 figures. Experts list several things that led to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s low rate: _ A literate society eager for medical advice _ A system of universal health insurance _ A Maternal and <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handbook </ORGANIZATION>, standard issue for every pregnant woman since World War II, which has 58 pages of health records and advice on pregnancy and child care from birth to age 6 A typical Japanese mother is a married woman in her late 20s _ the safest ages for childbearing _ and she is pregnant with her first or second child. The handbook tells her what to eat, how much milk to drink and when to visit a doctor. By the time labor pains begin she will have undergone about a dozen prenatal checkups, two of them courtesy of the government. `` A Japanese mother is very interested in her own health and the child to be born,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kazuaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyagishima </PERSON> of the health ministry's Maternal and Child Health Division. `` She follows intensive prenatal care.'' Like virtually all mothers of her generation, she gives birth in a delivery room. Her hospital stay lasts a week, giving doctors time to keep watch on the baby. Insurance takes care of most of the costs, which usually run about 200,000 yen -LRB- $ 1,560 -RRB-. Depending on need, the government will pay the rest, and add 100,000 yen -LRB- $ 780 -RRB- as a gift. Officials provide coupons for free checkups for the baby and send a public health nurse to the home. Legions of volunteers pay monthly house calls on rural newborns and report their progress to local officials. But abortions are not figured in the official infant mortality rate; the abortion figures themselves are difficult to establish. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s registered abortion rate is 17.1 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, near the top among Western nations. Doctors say, however, the real figure could be two to four times higher, because not all abortions are reported to the government as required by law. Adding the doctors' estimates of unreported abortions would put <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> well ahead of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which had a 1983 rate of 27.4 per 1,000. Officials say the hidden abortions take place among teen-agers. While they accounted for only 5.4 percent of registered abortions in 1986, that number has been rising along with teen pregnancies. Babies born to teens and women over 35 are at highest risk for late fetal and early neonatal deaths. Women over 35 are almost twice as likely to have infants with congenital defects. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the two groups of high-risk mothers account for 42 percent of registered abortions and only 8.8 percent of live births. They are the only groups among whom abortion is increasing. `` Looking at the national statistics, it seems there could be a link between a high rate of abortion among high-risk mothers and the infant mortality rate,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Eikkichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuyama </PERSON>, director of obstetrics and gynecology at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kosei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nenkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, when asked why the figures showed infant mortality at the bottom and abortions near the top. `` It's a connection I've never thought of until now. But it's not illogical.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Eugenic Protection Law allows abortions even as late as the second trimester of pregnancy to `` prevent the increase of inferior descendants and to protect the life of the mother.'' `` Abortion is quite a big program in Japanese family planning,'' said <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Konagai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` One-fourth of <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women have experienced abortions.'' <PERSON> Matsuyama </PERSON> and others say that preventing high-risk births is not the key to lowering infant mortality. They say it's an incidental factor in an already successful program. But the government is pushing programs for telephone counseling and sex education in schools to lower the teen-age abortion rate, <PERSON> Miyagishima </PERSON> said. `` In general, mother and child health is on a high standard already,'' he said. `` It is a very hard task to find a -LRB- new -RRB- target.''

 One of the reasons given for so many healthy babies in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Tender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of volunteer women who visit new mothers and their babies in their own homes. The corps operates on the tradition that neighbors look out for each other. It mobilizes 80,000 mothers who volunteer to keep tabs on the health of 2 million households with children in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s outlying cities and hamlets Here in <LOCATION> Yamato </LOCATION> village, a collection of small farms and quarries perched among mountaintop forests, volunteer <PERSON> Hatsuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirayama </PERSON> visits six families every month. She makes her rounds on foot over steep paths and concrete-paved roads 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Our purpose is to see that healthy babies are born,'' explained Mrs. <PERSON> Hirayama </PERSON>, a woman in her fifties with children of her own. `` The public health nurse ca n't always visit homes, so I do.'' One of the mothers she visits is <PERSON> Yoshimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirayama </PERSON>, a distant relative in this town of 1,890 people. The visits began when the 24-year-old housewife became pregnant with her second child, which turned out to be a daughter, <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, who now is now 10 months old. `` She told me to breast feed,'' <PERSON> Yoshimi </PERSON> said. `` She told me to eat things that would build bones _ small fish, lots of milk. `` She's like another mother. When I had my first baby I did n't know anybody here, but I could go to Mrs. <PERSON> Hirayama </PERSON> and ask her anything. <PERSON> Yoshimi </PERSON>'s pregnancy was normal. She followed her doctor's instructions to undergo health checks every three weeks during the first two trimesters, then biweekly and weekly until delivery In between came prenatal care and childbirth classes at the village hall. In April, after she gave birth to <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, a public health nurse stopped by to check on the mother and baby after their return from the hospital. Mrs. <PERSON> Hirayama </PERSON> took it from there. `` Any teeth?'' she asked on a recent visit, pulling down <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>'s lower lip. `` Are you hiding them?'' Her notes on <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>'s diet, bedtimes and skin color are turned over to the health nurse, who evaluates them and recommends doctor's visits or looks in on the baby herself, if necessary. Mrs. <PERSON> Hirayama </PERSON> fills in monthly visit cards for each child she sees on her rounds until the child turns 6. Then it is time for school teachers to keep an eye out.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> has been a guest on a hit TV variety show, sung with a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> rock group, sold potato pancakes on <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s main square, and gets his name and picture in the papers. That may not be unusual for a celebrity, but it is for an ambassador. It's a `` fantastic opportunity,'' says <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, to reach 20 million ordinary West Germans. Since taking up his post here in September 1985, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> has become a regular fixture in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s news media and on television. News stories about him range from the birth of his son <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> last year to his constant efforts to present the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's message. `` The public affairs dimension of diplomacy is growing more important,'' the 41-year-old diplomat, a former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in his <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> made it clear he feels that reaching out to ordinary West Germans is a major part of his job. `` In a democratic country you have, in a way, two constituencies, one the government which you are accredited to, but secondly you have public opinion which has an impact on the government.'' `` There's been a certain interest in a younger ambassador,'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said. `` To some extent I think I've taken advantage of that interest to try to project a fun, open-minded, dynamic image of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' At the age of 38, he became the youngest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in West German history. He took over the post from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who was then 81 and known for his reserved, formal ways. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said he's made a special effort to `` win over'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s young people, tens of thousands of whom took to the streets in 1983 to protest the installation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in the country. `` They do n't remember CARE packages, the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift,'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said, referring to vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> postwar relief and aid programs. `` They remember <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Among <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s most heavily publicized exploits was his singing stint with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> rock group at a recording studio in January 1986. Articles and pictures filled West German newspapers afterward. `` That was not sought after,'' he said. `` I was a little bit naive at that point.'' This past Nov. 28, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> appeared on a television stunt and variety show called `` Wetten, Dass'' -LRB- Will You Bet That ... -RRB-. The superstar moderator, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottschalk </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>: `` Can you imagine that one day you wo n't just be called ` your excellence,' but also Mr. President _ and I can still call you <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>?'' Speaking in slow, halting German, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> responded with a smile: `` I will be president when you are the federal chancellor -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leader -RRB-.'' Asked in the interview about that appearance, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> replied: `` Here's 20 million people who are never going to get a chance to meet an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador.'' He was, he said, a `` fantastic opportunity to project a positive image.'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> lost his bet on a stunt on the Saturday night show. So, three weeks later, as agreed before the TV audience, he went <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s main square and sold potato pancakes in a pouring rain to raise money for charity Sometimes, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s pronouncements, especially on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, have brought criticism from West Germans. In a full-page guest essay printed in the influential magazine <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> on Feb. 22, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> expounded on the idea that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies must share with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the risks of a nuclear a war. The contribution, printed in German, brought a sharp retort the following week from <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bahr </ORGANIZATION>, the 66-year-old arms control expert of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` He finds it simply unreasonable,'' <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> wrote, `` that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should remain a target for nuclear weapons, while ` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is freed from the burden of the stationing of nuclear arms.' I do n't.'' <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> continued: `` The family that lives near the border with the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- during any conflict runs an incomparably bigger risk than a family in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' During the interview, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> was asked whether he looked forward to overseeing the removal of the intermediate-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after ratification of the U.S.-Soviet missile accord. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> responded with a laugh and said: `` It's an interesting question because before coming to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, when I was assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, I worked very, very hard to put them in. So I have n't really focused on taking them out.''

 When <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> left home to join the circus, she went all the way to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. For a National Geographic special, <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> and her camera crew spent nine weeks following circuses across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has more such extravaganzas than any other country. The one-hour `` Inside the Soviet Circus,'' produced and written by <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, will be broadcast Wednesday on PBS. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bikel </PERSON> narrates. The circus is a part of everyday life in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and attracts more than 70 million people a year. More than 100 troupes, all government-supported, travel the vast country from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. It was in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> found one of the stars for the special, <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>. For 40 years he has clowned in a Soviet one-ring circus. His humor is universal and cuts across all international barriers. `` The Russian circus is a world unto itself,'' said <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>. `` You do n't need to know the language to get the jokes. It's exciting, it's colorful. And it's very good circus. The government does n't spare any expense They want the people to enjoy it.'' The tradition of the Russian circus goes back many years to the wandering juggler, trained bears, Gypsies and tightrope walkers. `` The European circus came to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> at the time of <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> the Great,'' she said. `` She ordered horses from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A certain gentleman brought not only riding horses, but trick horses as well. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> was very taken with the horses and the man. She had a circus building erected in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, which is now <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. `` The Russian circuses are always one ring and the aerialists work without a net. They emphasize artistry, not danger. The clowns come on between the acts to distract the audience while the props are being moved. The clowns are very skilled at mocking what just happened.'' Although she calls it one of the most interesting experiences of her life, <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> said, `` I was happy to leave. I'd also be happy to go back. It's just the thought of settling down in one of those exotic locales. They're never quite as exotic as they look from the outside. `` I'd much rather capture their essence on film than live there.

<HEAD>The Japanese Gift To The Union Movement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese economic competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is often viewed negatively, especially by autoworkers hurt by imports. But the Japanese have also come bearing gifts. They raised levels of quality. They forced competitors to rid themselves of waste at every level from plant floor to chairman's office They compelled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> management to get off its duff and innovate. But their biggest contribution might be in management-labor relations, at least in the automobile industry. And it was in that industry that relations had, in effect, become proceedings in a divorce case. For complex reasons, workers and executives had become such foes that it might have been better had they never spoken to each other. Each depended for survival on making cars. But they fought each other. They were rigidly set. In competitive markets, rigidity leads to death. Competition, according to Nobel laureate <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON>, is a `` dynamic discovery procedure.'' It never stops; if one company ceases to innovate, another surely will. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> automotive industry, unions helped frustrate innovation by inflexible work rules, job classifications and resistance to technological change, while simultaneously insisting on higher wages. Attitudes began changing slowly as the Japanese, starting from a zero base, grabbed almost a quarter of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. And now, according to a university report, union and management now see salvation rather than ruin in the new way. The new way is Japanese, at least as it applies to labor relations. The Japanese way, according to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON>, is for unions to be enterprising and cooperative for the common good of themselves and the company. <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON>, a fellow at the Center for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, observes that Japanese unions have a strong interest in strengthening the competitive position of the employer. National unions seldom interfere in local decisions. Members recognize that job security is possible only in a healthy company. They accept transfers to different areas of the plant. They perform a variety of jobs. They take pay cuts, in the form of reduced bonuses, as an alternative to mass layoffs. <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON> feels American workers are increasingly receptive to such procedures, citing the Japanese-style labor relations already practiced at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> plant, a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> joint venture. That plant, at <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had been an intense headache for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, which closed it in 1982 with the loss of 5,000 jobs. Between 1963 and that year, there were four shutdowns for sickouts and strikes. Absenteeism forced the assembly line to close. Drugs and alcohol were just two of many problems. Labor relations were acrimonious, almost violent. Inevitably, the productivity level at the plant was incredible. It took an average of 34 manhors of labor to produce a vehicle, compared to only 20 hours to produce a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>. And the final product sometimes was a mess. Cooperation is now a two-way street, according to <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON>. Management has made written promises of job security and has agreed to take salary cuts before laying off workers. In addition, union and management have promised to work together to resolve problems arising from layoffs, production schedule changes, major investments and day-to-day decisions once left entirely to management. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union has made other unusual concessions to help with productivity and profits. It agreed to reduce job classes from more than 200 to three, eliminating featherbedding. It allowed workers to be trained for several jobs, allowing manufacturing flexibility. The two once-vicious enemies also adopted the Japanese technique of `` kaisan,'' under which workers and management have regular discussions on how to perform jobs more efficiently for their mutual benefit. Already, says <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON>, evidence that parts of the experiment might become fixtures in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> management-labor relations can be found in the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, which permit an unprecedented degree of cooperation. There is recognition that labor and management are not competing against one another, says <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON>. `` The competition lies elsewhere,'' he says. As it always has.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Wherever he goes, a small army goes with him. Virtually everything he does in public is planned, scripted and rehearsed. Even a visit to a club two blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> follows an elaborate scenario. That's the insulating apparatus of the presidency today. It was n't always that way.

 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> liked to take a walk every morning, a habit he did n't abandon even after <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> died. Promptly at 7 a.m., the president, a fedora on his head and usually a cane in his hand, would set off from the White House at a brisk 120 paces a minute. The route varied _ sometimes across <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and up <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, sometimes on a circuit of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Taxi drivers would shout their hellos. Sometimes the president paused to sign an autograph for a tourist. Often a reporter or two showed up, joining the president and his brace of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> men. A few weeks ago, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went two blocks along one of <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s walking routes to dedicate the newly rebuilt <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Here is what happened: When the motorcade of nine <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cars and an ambulance, escorted by <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police cars and motorcycles, pulled up at the club at 10:30 a.m., the president's limousine pulled into an unadorned side entrance leading to a loading dock. Club officials had wanted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to come in the elegant front door, but a White House advance team had vetoed the idea in a meeting with club officers two weeks earlier. Too dangerous. Stepping from his limo, the president walked to a freight elevator, carpeted for the occasion, through a loading dock area that had been cleared of clutter. From the elevator, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had first proposed that the president pass through the first-floor kitchen. Club officers, however, wanted the president to see some of the memorabilia _ the cannon seized in the Spanish-American War, the preliminary casting of the Iwo Jima memorial, the busts of <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> _ that line the long second-floor hall they call The Parade. So they ended up greeting the president on the second floor. In a routine that had been rehearsed for days, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hittle </PERSON>, the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer who is the club president, was supposed to open a door to guide <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> into the main ballroom. As they reached the door, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Presidential Advance, whispered to <PERSON> Hittle </PERSON>, `` Not in here! The door's locked!'' <PERSON> Hittle </PERSON> opened another door into the ballroom, a few yards down the hall. Then the president was taken down a circular staircase to pass through a receiving line of club officials and their wives, and to cut a ribbon. <PERSON> Hittle </PERSON> then escorted the president into the dining room. The other officers had already taken their places. It had all been rehearsed, with <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> playing the part of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The second of the two steps that led up to the dais had been marked with adhesive tape as a precaution against stumbling. The white drapes in the windows, normally drawn back, were lowered. The window at the end, where the president would speak, was protected by a bulletproof glass shield. `` In the old days, I'm told, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> often invited their neighbor, the president, to all their parties,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his remarks. `` I've also heard that <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> walked over for a toddy or two. Oh, for the good old days.'' Those days are gone forever. This simple presidential visit, planned since the club's invitation was accepted months before, had required the initial meeting with 16 White House people two weeks earlier, at least two walk-throughs, a number of rehearsals, several more meetings on the site and constant telephone calls For more than a week beforehand, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been working on communications for the president and his staff. A holding room was needed for the president, a place where he could receive or make a telephone call if needed. Club officers proposed an office just off the lobby, but the lobby was too crowded. `` The second time they were over, they asked, ` Is there a better place?','' said <PERSON> Hittle </PERSON>. Finally, they chose a modest security room near the loading dock. Half an hour before the president arrived, traffic on surrounding streets and access to the building were sealed off. Every moment that he is before the public, the president is backed up by a script that spells out his every motion, a staff that looks after his protection and his image and an aerial fleet that can carry limousines and tons of communications equipment anywhere in the world. No other leader, not even the pope in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in some respects, is accompanied by quite the pomp and circumstance that follow the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wherever he goes. Some presidents have chafed at this structured life. It seems to fit <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> like a glove. The trappings help fend off possible danger. They keep the president in constant touch with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and other world capitals. They make his public appearances come off smoothly. They also insulate the leader of the world's premier democracy from the people he leads. `` Every one of these guys becomes a little more isolated,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> military office, who served under presidents from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` I think the isolation of presidents is dangerous stuff,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist and leading student of the presidency. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> says the president does not get the advice he needs `` when you have the argument going on only in a limited closed-in coterie.'' This is particularly true with a president, he says, `` who like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is very much tuned in to those in the same room with him _ who are right next to him.''

 Not for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the freedom to browse in bookstores, as <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> likes to do, or to stroll on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> recently did on the Champs Elysees. A couple of months after his inauguration in 1981, the president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did take a walk, on a sunny March Sunday, across <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to attend church. The next day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was wounded in an assassination attempt outside a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel. He has n't taken a walk in public since. Recent presidents have reacted differently to the increasing amount of fuss and security. `` The only time that I ever knew a president to get out of the corral was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON> says. `` He set his own agenda. This guy would not only tell me what airplanes to use, he would tell me who was going to be on the airplane. He made up the manifest. `` When <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> came along, everything was orderly,'' says <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also introduced white tunics, black trousers and shiny black hats for White House policemen. After protests and ridicule, the officers were allowed to return to workaday police outfits. But another <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> innovation, the use of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard in splendid dress uniform as doorkeeper for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>, is still in effect. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> experimented with having smartly uniformed trumpeters, their horns draped with banners, signal the arrival of the president at social occasions. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> cut out the traditional playing of `` Hail to the Chief'' altogether. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the performer with a flare for the theatrical, brought it back. The president, with his background as an actor with a reputation for taking direction well, still takes direction well. He has said of his <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> period, `` For eight years, somebody handed me a piece of paper every night that told me what I was going to be doing the next day.'' He has made similar statements about his White House existence. At his annual summertime party for the press in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, he goes by the book, entering the grounds and walking to a specified spot, then taking a specified route through the crowd and going at a specified time to a bandstand to make off-the-record remarks. `` His time is scheduled very precisely, much more precisely than I would have ever thought,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, who came to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year as director of the military office. `` There was a book printed for the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit, and that ran only 2 -LCB- days. The book was approximately an inch thick, a minute-by-minute rundown of who goes where, when, who accompanies the president, who rides in which elevator. It's the kind of a book that we get if we even go to make a speech in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to a bunch of high school kids.'' When the American president travels, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> goes with him. It's set up in the Biltmore Hotel in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, or in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. `` You can get two helicopters on and get the ground crews for them on a C-5A,'' says <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON>. `` You also take a car, a backup and a follow-up for <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. And in my time it took about 20 communicators and 6,000 pounds of communications equipment for each stop. That would be whether he goes for 15 minutes or whether he goes overnight.'' Even if the president goes to a private dinner at the home of friends, it takes a 15-car motorcade with a cluster of military and security aides, a doctor and other staff. `` It's usually no problem and people expect it,'' says <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, chief of press advance for the White House. `` Once in a while it's an inconvenience. It's just that so many people come with him that sometimes they have a hard time knowing what to do with them.'' Wherever the president travels, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> sets up its own telephone switchboard and installs special phones for all his aides. No other country does exactly the same thing. Still, some of the other leaders come fairly close. When Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> travels abroad, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> flies two bulletproof, glass-enclosed `` popemobiles'' ahead. The pontiff's entourage numbers as many as 30 people, including top prelates, security men, a valet and a photographer The pope does not have his own plane, however. He travels on chartered jets, taking <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and making the return leg on an airliner of the country he visited. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s summit visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December gave Americans a chance to compare the entourages of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet leaders. `` I think there are an awful lot of parallels,'' says <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>. `` Their motorcade is even larger than ours. I have never seen motorcades as large as the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> motorcades. The longest one was some 50 vehicles.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took four Ilyushin jetliners with him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents prevented a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television crew from filming the extensive wardrobe being rushed up the gangway for him and his wife. Although motorcades in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are usually only two or three cars, special lanes are reserved for official cars and uniformed police often halt traffic for their passage. Members of an elite unit wearing electric-blue shoulderboards guard the Kremlin. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> travels abroad on one of three <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707s reserved for top government officials. There is no equivalent to Air Force One. <PERSON> Hans-Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON>, a chancellery spokesman in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, said no West German chancellor has ever taken a limousine abroad. `` After the war, <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Adenauer </PERSON> adopted a modest style that was suited to the time, and since then other chancellors have followed suit,'' <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON> says. `` Now that is what Germans expect of their chancellors.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has a reputation for grandeur, and the <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> provides one of the world's most splendid presidential settings, but things are simpler when <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is traveling. He usually flies in the supersonic Concorde, primarily as a plug for the French aerospace industry. He gets around <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in a short motorcade, and streets are blocked a few minutes before he is scheduled to pass. He generally spends the night at his <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> apartment, not in the palace on the <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Security around <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has increased since an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> assassination attempt in 1984, but is still slight compared with the ring around <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. She uses one of three look-alike official limousines at home, but when abroad rides in either a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> limousine or one supplied by her hosts. The prime minister's movements are no longer announced publicly in advance but members of the public are free to, for example, walk into a hotel where she is giving a speech. As for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, in his book, `` Witness to Power,'' gave this summing up: `` ... we wonder at the man in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> who is so strangely different from the rest of us. We fail to recognize that he is an animal which has been groomed to run a special race and has forgotten how to do almost everything else.'' Following a rigid schedule is nothing new to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who, for the past 20 years, has visited the same couple in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, over the New Year holiday; who, during his annual <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation in August, routinely visits the same acquaintances in the same order on a trip to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I think he's got a personality that's responsive to this type of thing,'' says <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON>, who observes the White House now from the vantage point of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultant. Even in the most rustic settings, the trappings of power are there. On one of their Easter vacations, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> helicoptered from their hard-to-reach <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch to a more accessible neighboring spread to join a motorcade to go to church. As the helicopter landed, a Marine in dress uniform, who flies on the ` copter to be ready to open the emergency exits if needed, stepped out He was joined by other Marines sent from <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, as a ground crew, also in dress blues for Easter. There they were: the Reagans, off in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> living the simple life the president so often extols; the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in their resplendent outfits standing at attention, saluting smartly, as the president and first lady made their way down a dusty tire-track road to the limousine. `` The Founding Fathers made one big mistake,'' says political scientist <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>. `` They should have made <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> king and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> prime minister, so that he would have had some kind of royalty at the top to gather all of this emotion that now feeds into our <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, all this ceremonial jazz.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> aide now with the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` Let's start with the proposition that presidents do get shot at, and on occasion killed. A lot of these trappings really have in part a protective purpose. Secondly, the trappings of our country are really not only not out of line with other countries, but in some regards quite modest. The White House, for example, is relatively small compared with the mansions and the palaces that other heads of state live in. So we do have to put that in some perspective.'' In whatever perspective, all this ceremonial jazz comes to an end for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January, when he steps aboard Air Force One for his last flight home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Then the country will see how the next president responds to it.

 Just as it is for her husband, life in public is for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a preordained venture, in which surprises are singularly unwelcome. On a sightseeing tour at the 1987 economic summit in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, an aide makes an `` X'' in masking tape on a cobblestone to mark where <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should stop for photographers. There are no similar marks for the mayor of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> or the wife of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s prime minister. When she goes to <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Ferry, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to welcome a trainload of make-believe comic-strip characters campaigning against drugs, a six-person advance team, similar to the president's but smaller, precedes her by four days Her traveling party on trips abroad includes her personal assistant, hairdresser, personal secretary, photographer, medic, protocol officer and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents. She flies on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane, designated Executive Foxtrot One. On a side trip from <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, it was an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 outfitted to accommodate the first lady and 40 to 44 other passengers as well as the pilots, stewards and military communications personnel. On other trips, it is a smaller plane. `` Security does n't really allow her to fly commercial,'' says <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary. By contrast, <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and her daughter, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, used to go from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Independence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, by train, paying for their own first-class compartment. Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> rode the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle on shopping trips to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. By the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, however, the presidential family was flying on government planes. <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also gets some perks. Her clothes, hats, furs, shoes and accouterments are something the average Soviet woman can only dream about.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ With so many experiments under way at the same time, it's difficult to pinpoint television's birthplace. Among the cities that lay claim to TV `` firsts'' is <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, N.Y. There, 60 years ago, a handful of viewers witnessed the first broadcast to television sets installed in the home.

 The flickering pink picture of a man playing a ukulele was a small miracle in an age of wonder, all but forgotten beyond the town once known as `` The City That Lights The World.'' The year was 1928, and <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> had grown from a sleepy hamlet on the Erie Canal to a booming factory town where the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had its headquarters and its finest research talent. For two years, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexanderson </PERSON>, a consulting engineer for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, had been tinkering with a machine that used perforated spinning disks to transmit pictures. It was the mechanical ancestor of television. On Jan. 13, 1928, the first experimental television program was broadcast from the GE lab to the <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> homes of <LOCATION> Alexanderson </LOCATION> and two GE executives. There, scientists, company officials and reporters gathered to peer into the pinkish light of a tiny screen, 3 inches square, mounted in a cabinet. The two-hour program with simulcast radio sound began with a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> executive taking off his glasses and smoking a cigarette, followed by a radio announcer strumming a ukulele and humming `` Ai n't She Sweet.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarnoff </PERSON>, then vice president and later president of RCA, appeared on the program and called it `` an epoch-making development.'' The event `` heralded another human conquest of space,'' said a front-page story in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. It was hailed as `` the first absolute proof of the possibility of connecting homes throughout the world by sight as they have already been connected by voice,'' the article continued. This year, <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> station which claims that day as its birthday, is celebrating with a series of parties and programs commemorating 60 years of television history. `` We're very proud of that heritage,'' says <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>'s program manager and producer of a historical documentary on the station `` We're the only station that can trace its history back that far.'' Actually, the birthdate and birthplace of television are quite indistinct in history books. `` Television is one of the hardest areas to pinpoint ` firsts' in,'' says <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizowitch </PERSON>, a specialist in radio and television history at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were just so many experiments going on at the same time.'' Independent American inventor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> produced the world's first working television and demonstrated it in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in 1925. A comedy skit was broadcast from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> labs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in April 1927. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zworykin </PERSON> developed the first electronic television system, which ultimately replaced the mechanical scanners, in the 1920s. But the demonstration in January 1928 in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> apparently was the first broadcast to television sets installed in homes, according to the reference book, `` Famous First Facts.'' The GE station was known as W2XB when it got its first federal license and started a regular program schedule in May 1928, with farm and weather reports three afternoons a week. It was the world's first regular television program schedule, according to `` Famous First Facts.'' From there, <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION> boasts a series of `` firsts'' in television history. It televised the first `` remote'' broadcast -LRB- outside the studio -RRB-, with an August 1928 live telecast of Gov. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> accepting the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president at the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. The following month, the station televised the first play, a blood-and-guts drama called `` The Queen's Messenger,'' complete with props and sound effects. At the time, there were still only four households equipped with the 3-inch-screen TV sets. The first transatlantic telecast was made when the image of Professor <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was transmitted from <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1931. In 1939, <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were linked by a series of relay towers down through the <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, thus forming the first television network. The visit of the King and Queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair in 1939 was beamed live to <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>. `` The World's Fair did more to publicize TV than anything else,'' <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> said in an interview at <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>'s 40,000-square-foot studio complex in suburban <LOCATION> Niskayuna </LOCATION>. `` GE had a huge exhibit. Thousands of people went through and saw themselves on television for the first time.'' <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>, which switched its network affiliation to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, became the first <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in 1939. It aired the first complete opera on TV in 1943 with a performance of `` Hansel and <PERSON> Gretel </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetrault </PERSON>, anchorman of <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>'s evening news, became the station's first full-time staff announcer in 1951. His 37 years with <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION> make <PERSON> Tetrault </PERSON> the longest-tenured anchorman in the country, says News Manager <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>. `` There was little emphasis on news in the early days,'' says <PERSON> Tetrault </PERSON>. `` It was pretty much rip-and-read _ we mainly depended on newsreel services and the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` For example, one day back in the'50s there was a big fire at the main GE plant, right near the studio,'' says <PERSON> Tetrault </PERSON>. `` Our news manager looked out the window and said, ` Hey, there's a fire at GE! Get AP on the phone and see if we can get something on it.''' When <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>'s lone cameraman shot a story, it took hours to process the film. `` He'd have to string it on sawhorses to dry,'' says <PERSON> Tetrault </PERSON>. `` It would take all afternoon to do what takes minutes with modern video equipment.'' Now, <ORGANIZATION> WRGB </ORGANIZATION>, which has a dominant audience share in an area with four commercial stations and two public ones, has all the latest newsgathering gadgetry, including trucks for live remotes, nine new electronic news cameras, and sophisticated editing equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which bought the station for $ 57 million in 1986, has pumped millions of dollars into the station and increased the staff to 125 from 100, says General Manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Contrary to its cartoon image, the coyote is a cunning hunter blamed for annual losses of nearly $ 70 million worth of sheep. Long the bane of Western farmers, the coyote has migrated East, filling an ecological niche created by elimination of a far less destructive predator _ the wolf.

 The first sheep was killed on <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s farm last March, then another, and another, and another. Within 10 months, at least 80 lambs and ewes worth $ 10,000 were slain on his farm and an adjoining one. Predatory teeth tore the sheeps' throats or pierced their skulls, and their soft inner organs were eaten. All clues point to coyotes, an <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> predator whose numbers are growing in the East. `` It's circumstantial evidence. Nobody's actually seen a coyote kill the sheep. But it pretty much has to be coyotes,'' says <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 67, who tends 100 head of sheep on his 200-acre <LOCATION> Greene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farm. To convince skeptics, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> paid a trapper $ 50 to prove the coyotes existed. Five females have been trapped or shot near the scene of the crimes _ rolling pasture 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, as opposed to the high grassy plains of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. That's good enough for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belding </PERSON>, land management officer for the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Game Commission, who calls the evidence `` overwhelming'' and `` conclusive.'' Before 1980, only six cases of coyotes killing sheep had been verified in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The new run-ins with farmers are proof the coyote, preceded by its mystique and villainous reputation, has brought its eerie yips and howls to new territory. A cousin of the wolf and the dog, the coyote looks like a small German shepherd with a fox-like head, pointed nose and bushy tail that resembles a bottle brush. The Eastern coyote has some wolf and dog genes, and the biggest ones weigh 55 pounds. Its prairie-dwelling kin weighs about 30 pounds. Coyotes are cunning hunters, bearing no resemblance to the hapless cartoon character <PERSON> Wile </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyote </PERSON>, whose comical schemes always backfire as he vainly chases a road runner. Real coyotes feast on mice, rabbits, deer, carrion, grasshoppers, fruits and berries. They also kill lambs, calves, goats, chickens, geese, pigs, barnyard cats, llamas and other domestic livestock. Coyotes have pilfered watermelons on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farms. In October, coyotes killed 48 flamingos in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo after keepers mistakenly left the birds' pen open. Coyotes vanished from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> 10,000 years ago during the Ice Age. They began returning in the late 1890s when the practice of clear-cutting the state's forest exterminated the wolf by destroying its habitat. Coyotes thrive in open country. `` They're filling an ecological niche created when we eliminated the wolf,'' says Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a senior biologist at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The coyote is very resourceful. People have tried to poison them and trap them. It's tough to get rid of every last one.'' `` There are coyotes in every Eastern state,'' says <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, who did her master's study on coyote populations at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. `` The populations are building up and will continue to build up. I have a lot of admiration for them. They're intelligent. They're adaptable.'' Biologists believe coyotes migrated from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> in a giant arc north and east around the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> about 90 years ago. The route took them into <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, then south to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>. Others pushed east from the plains, while some were imported to be hunted by wolfhounds and sportsmen, Ms. <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> says. Each year, an estimated 1 million sheep, or 10 percent of the national stock, are killed by predators, and coyotes account for 90 percent of that, according to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. The loss is valued at $ 70 million. `` It's our number one preventable loss. This is the single largest cost of production that we think is reversible,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION>. The number of sheep ranchers has dwindled from 225,000 in the 1960s to 125,000, says Dr. <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>, former director of sheep research for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. Nationally, the sheep population has fallen from 55 million during World War II to 10 million, says <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>, who blames coyotes for much of the drop. To promote the use of mutton, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> sheep farmers coined this bumper sticker: `` Eat American Lamb, 5 Million Coyotes Ca n't Be Wrong.'' Others are more blunt. `` I only know one good coyote, and that's a dead coyote,'' says <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where farmers pay a bounty of $ 25. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, president of sheep growers association in <LOCATION> Greene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, calls coyotes `` a damned nuisance. They're taking money out of our pocket.'' The coyote has outsmarted and outlasted government attempts to shoot, trap and poison it into oblivion. In 1972, the government banned poison baits on federal lands, partly because non-target animals were being killed. In 1983, the government allowed farmers to use poison collars on sheep if they met two dozen restrictions to protect the environment. So far, the collars have been approved in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Wildlife groups say the coyote is unfairly maligned. Attacking a sheep is a learned skill, and not all coyotes kill livestock. Most avoid humans. They also keep mice populations in check. `` Coyotes are opportunistic. They're not evil,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagood </PERSON> of Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington-based group with 80,000 members nationwide. She says coyotes can be discouraged by guard dogs, electric fences, placing ewes in sheds when they lamb and selective shooting or trapping of sheep killers. `` It would be a waste of time, effort and money to try to eliminate them. The government spent millions of dollars and failed to eradicate the coyote. We would hate to see Eastern states adopting Western philosophies and making the same mistakes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hagood </PERSON> says. Some states have studied the impact of coyotes on deer populations. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, selective trapping eliminates troublesome coyotes, but the animals are not significantly damaging the deer herd. `` As far as I know, the coyote has not had any serious repercussions on native wildlife. It does not appear to be a disaster. If it is causing people problems, people have themselves to blame,'' says <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where coyotes can be hunted or trapped year-round, they number an estimated 2,000 to 3,000. Says <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a coyote expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, `` They're probably everywhere but downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The man who created gospel music is as obscure as his music is popular. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> is now 88 and bedridden in his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home. A handful of gospel devotees are working to build a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory.

 More than half a century ago, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of his youth to create a foot-stomping, soul-slapping sound that still fills black churches. A personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and love of the bawdy, bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the young jazz pianist to create what he called `` gospel'' music. Now 88, bedridden in his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> is in danger of dying in obscurity, his legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music but do n't know his name. `` He was the person who gave blacks a medium to keep their tradition alive,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a professor of religion and African American studies at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and the author of a new biography on <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>. Black church music before <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> `` was very easygoing. It was n't upbeat, it was n't filled with a lot of rhythmic tones,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Storman </PERSON>, a former gospel performer who with a handful of other aficionados is working to build a Dorsey foundation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> `` It was n't until the late'20s and'30s that a lot of ministers would let that kind of music into their church,'' <PERSON> Storman </PERSON> says. `` The ministers figured that it was indecent and unreligious. For them it was like some people react to acid rock music today.'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>'s song `` It's Tight Like That'' hit the top of the blues charts about September 1928, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. `` A number of people were very shocked to see the type of music they danced to the night before the next morning in church,'' he says. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>'s all-time greatest hit, `` Take My Hand, Precious Lord,'' was the favorite song of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and was popularized by the late <PERSON> Mahalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who once toured with <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>. It has been translated into more than 50 languages. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>'s work includes more than 1,000 gospel tunes and all would be displayed, his wife, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, said in an interview from the couple's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> home. `` I think he would think it was one of the greatest things that ever happened,'' she said. `` It would be the only one in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' dedicated solely to <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, she said. But efforts to raise a half-million dollars for the foundation have faltered. A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> concert in December was to be the group's first fund-raising event, but it was canceled for lack of interest <PERSON> Storman </PERSON> says that while people know <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>'s music, they do n't know <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> They confuse him with <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, the jazz bandleader of the 1940s. In promoting <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Storman </PERSON> and colleagues have found that `` people thought we were talking about the jazz artist. We had to remind people that <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> had passed.'' <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> died in 1956. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> was born July 1, 1899, just outside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. His father was sickly, and he, his mother and four siblings had to help support the family. `` His mother was a very, very religious woman who had been a profound influence on him,'' says <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` He became enamored of a resident pianist at a local theater. Then as a 12-year-old boy he started playing in bordellos, playing piano, blues. By that time, he was supporting his family.'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> later began composing blues and playing jazz and blues piano. He adopted the stage name `` <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>.'' He began experimenting with gospel music as a way to reconcile an internal conflict over his religious upbringing and his early love of blues, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. As a young man, <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and gradually began to concentrate on composing gospel music. `` He was the first black man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to publish gospel music, in 1926,'' and started his own publishing firm at that time in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Storman </PERSON> says. He sent his first two gospel songs, `` If You See My Saviour'' and `` How About You,'' to hundreds of churches. `` Not a single person ordered one,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. `` He spent time going from church to church trying to sell this. The people thought it was blues, an inappropriate kind of music for formal worship.'' In 1931, <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> was devastated by the deaths of his first wife and baby daughter in childbirth. `` That was when he wrote his all-time great, ` Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''' <PERSON> Storman </PERSON> says. `` And that was when he became totally dedicated to just doing gospel.'' In January 1932, at <ORGANIZATION> Ebenezer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> to form a choir. A month later, at <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to preach an anniversary service, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> brought the choir and `` staid Pilgrim Baptist Church ... went wild.'' Two days later <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> the job of directing his church chorus. `` I was a little boy then,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>'s son and the current minister. `` You could n't get into the church. The fire department came to keep the traffic moving ... every Sunday morning.'' Under <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, the choir gained national attention, and he remained its director until the late 1970s, when he retired. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, a tall, thin, distinguished-looking man, was shrewd in his business dealings. `` He was self-taught, never went beyond third grade. But he took this gospel thing and built his own publishing business out of it,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> sold his business in the early 1950s to New York-based Chapel Music, which has continued to publish his music, his attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> also knew how to create music that performers want to sing. `` There's no comparison to him. He's in a class all by himself,'' says gospel singer <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` The songs that he wrote ... they have such a meaning, they have such a message. People are forgetting <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>. But you really ca n't forget him. He should be remembered as the father of gospel music, the founder of gospel music.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has been largely tamed by the Chinese government's relentless dike - and reservoir-building efforts But many still remember the day 50 years ago when a ruptured dike sent the waters cascading over village rooftops, killing 890,000 and leaving millions homeless.

 <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoshan </PERSON> was just 5 years old when Chinese Nationalists broke the dike on the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 50 years ago in a vain attempt to stop advancing Japanese troops. <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> took refuge in a large floating pot. `` The water was over the roofs in some villages,'' <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> recalls of the 1938 calamity that claimed an estimated 890,000 lives and left millions homeless and without food. <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>'s family had to beg to survive. Today, the retired worker lives quietly a short stroll away from that once-ruptured dike, confident neither man nor nature will ever again unleash the river known as `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Sorrow.'' The 3,388-mile Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization and the bane of its existence, has been largely tamed by relentless dike - and reservoir-building efforts of the Communist government since it took power in 1949 But there remains an undercurrent of threat to the 110 million people who live along the banks of the world's muddiest river. `` Nature does not change easily,'' says <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiande </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Yellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Zhengzhou </LOCATION>, the capital of central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province. The river begins in the remote plateaus of western <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province and winds through nine provinces before reaching <LOCATION> Bohai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province. Over the past 2,000 years, it has flooded some 1,500 times. It has changed course 26 times in recorded history, about once every century, each time disrupting the lives of millions. In 1887, when the river tore through its banks in <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>, 11 large cities were inundated and a 50,000-square-mile area was under water for two months. Hundreds of thousands _ perhaps millions _ died. There has been no major flood since 1946, largely because of a dike-building program comparable to the excavation of two <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> canals. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> says his 29,000-member commission has overseen the construction of seven of the 30 reservoirs that are planned to help control the river while supplying electrical power and irrigation to the barren riverside plains. But he says his engineers have still made only small gains in controlling the flow of sandy yellowish sediment that gives the river its name and its unique power to destroy. As the river courses southward from Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> through the chalky and erosion-pocked loess plateau of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s midsection, it deposits 1.6 billion tons of silt in its middle and lower reaches. Every year the riverbed in the lower reaches rises another 4 inches, creating what is called a `` suspended river'' where the water level is 13 to 23 feet above the surrounding land. Since 1949 the dikes have been heightened and reinforced three times to contain the rising waters. The huge <LOCATION> Sanmenxia </LOCATION> dam in western <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> had to be rebuilt almost immediately after it was completed in the 1960s because engineers were fooled by the onslaught of silt. The Yellow's powers of deception can be seen from atop the 500-year-old dikes north of <LOCATION> Zhengzhou </LOCATION> breached by <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s troops in 1938 and repaired in 1947 The river channel is 6 miles wide, but in the dry winter months the water is only several hundred yards across, a faint glimmer far out over the frozen mud flats packed with silt from the loess plains of <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province 600 miles to the northwest. Yet in the summer rainy season the entire channel is filled, and after hard rain the waters pound against the 16-foot high concrete embankments. A new, computerized warning system, built with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> assistance, gives engineers 20 hours' notice of a potential flood, says <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Conservancy Commission Senior Engineer <PERSON> Niu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengqi </PERSON>. That's time enough to open sluices and fill water-retention reservoirs. In the distant past, news of impending floods came via horseback. <PERSON> Niu </PERSON> says the government has spent $ 1.3 billion since 1949 to harness the river, and is now planning a new dam at <LOCATION> Xiaolangdi </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>, that should reduce sediment buildup by 40 percent over 50 years. There are other, more visionary plans, such as changing the course of the river _ largely discounted as too expensive and disruptive _ and linking the sluggish Yellow with its slightly longer sister to the south, the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION>. The idea is that the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION>, which carries far much more water than the Yellow, would help flush out the sediment on the Yellow's riverbed But Deputy Director <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> stresses that `` most important is solving the sediment problem by soil conservation in the loess region. Without vegetation, the problem of silt will only get worse.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has used the waters of the river to irrigate more than 10 million acres, five times the amount of irrigated land in 1949. But tree-plantings and other anti-erosion campaigns still cover only about one-fourth of the 172,000 square miles of loess plateau that loses its fragile topsoil to the river. Engineer <PERSON> Niu </PERSON> says he's sure deaths could be avoided if the waters rose to desperately high levels in the future. But up to 1 million people might have to be moved and $ 270 million in damages could be sustained if water has to be released into emergency retention areas. Along the river near <LOCATION> Zhengzhou </LOCATION>, where the soil was once too alkaline to produce anything but salt, irrigation has made the rice paddies the most productive in <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION>. `` I remember how afraid the peasants were when work began in 1955 to open the dike for the irrigation gate,'' says local resident <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>. `` They thought Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was breaking the dikes just as <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> before him.'' `` Now I do n't hate the river,'' says 70-year-old farmer <PERSON> Cui </PERSON> <PERSON> Xingxian </PERSON>, who stood on the wall as the Nationalist troops destroyed it. `` In the past I feared the river, but now I love it.''

 It was 10 years ago that we first met the <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> family, those oil barons of the <LOCATION> Southfork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. How times have changed _ and how `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' has changed. Few people today remember that the original star of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' was <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON>, and that her marriage to <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> -RRB- would give the show its theme of `` Romeo and Juliet.'' The feuding Barneses and the <ORGANIZATION> Ewings </ORGANIZATION> would be the show's <ORGANIZATION> Montagues </ORGANIZATION> and Capulets. It also had a dash of `` Giant'' and `` Peyton Place'' tossed in. It was even considered, but only briefly, that <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> would be killed in the fifth episode and it would be <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> vs. the family. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, was a supporting character, and his wife, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> -RRB-, was such a minor character she did n't even speak in the first show on April 2, 1978. The script referred to her only as the `` brunette on the couch'' and did n't even identify her as <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>'s wife. Still, <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> emerged with the meatiest role in the first show and he made the most of it. `` He is deliciously wicked as he attempts to eject Principal from the family bosom by any foul means,'' a pre-debut story said. Writer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> created the show with <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> as the focus. `` This is a poor girl who marries into a rich family _ and her own family's enemy,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said in a 1978 interview. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' was actually a spinoff of `` Knots Landing,'' although `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' got on the air first. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> locale was picked because <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> wanted to get away from the usual <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> background. `` It all seems like yesterday and a hundred years ago,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>, the current executive producer. He has been with the show since the beginning except for the season when both he and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> left the show. He calls it `` the season that did n't exist'' because it was all passed off as <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>'s dream when <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> returned He says there is some talk of putting together a retrospective of the show's 10 years during the summer for a special. `` We came on in the spring with five shows,'' he recalls. `` As far as we knew that's all we were going to do. Then <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> picked us up for seven more shows. Then enough shows to complete the first full season. We had a cliffhanger that year, but nobody remembers it.'' Few remember the first cliffhanger, in which Sue <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> wrecked her car and you did n't know if she and her unborn baby would survive. The second cliffhanger, in 1980, caused a phenomenon around the world that was unprecedented in the history of television. `` Who Shot J.R.?'' was on the lips of millions upon millions of people, from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. By the time it was revealed that <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> had pulled the trigger, `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' had climbed to No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings. It reigned over the ratings for the next four years, slipping once to second place, until <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> overtook CBS as the first-place network and `` The Cosby Show'' put the sitcoms back at the top of the ratings. A less well-known event of the summer of 1980 occurred when <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> to raise his salary to $ 100,000 an episode. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> not only refused but told <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> that <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> could wake up in the hospital after plastic surgery and be <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> got the last laugh, however. <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> says he is by far the highest paid performer on television today. `` And several other people on ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' are not too far behind,'' he says. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' captured the interest of the audience, <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> believes, because there had never been a family like this on television before. `` They were very wealthy, but they had no airs,'' he says. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was plain folks. They fought with each other, then made up. Plus, we showed that you ca n't equate money with happiness.'' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' did not become a serial until its first full season. `` Sue <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> became pregnant and no one knew whether the father was J.R. or <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>. `` We carried that story for quite a while. It caught on with the audience. So we began doing more stories that ran from week to week. `` We also found ourselves with the greatest character in television, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>. It's hard to say when he began to emerge, but it was probably the end of the fifth show when <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> lost her baby. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> had a fight in a hayloft and she fell and lost the baby. At first he seemed contrite, then you began to see how wicked he could be.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Jock </PERSON>, the patriarch of the <ORGANIZATION> Ewings </ORGANIZATION>, died in 1981. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> represented something we've never been able to recapture,'' says <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>. `` As bad as the boys could be, if he walked into a room and told them to knock it off they did. I think the audience responded to that strong head of the family and the warm woman -LRB- <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON> as Miss <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> -RRB- at the other end of the table. `` Much of <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>'s motivation was looking good in his father's eyes When <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> died that motivation disappeared. So we had to transfer it to his son. After that, when he did something terrible it was to build the empire for his son, as his father had done for him.'' Others have left the series and returned. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Bel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON> as Miss <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> when she had heart surgery. <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, left the show but returned this season. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> quit in 1985, but returned after missing one season _ the famous season that disappeared as <PERSON> Pam </PERSON>'s dream. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> herself is now gone with the departure of <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON>. Every departure shifted relationships. Without <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> had no one to hold him in check. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>'s departure separates her brother, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON> -RRB- from the <ORGANIZATION> Ewings </ORGANIZATION>. Is `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' a soap opera or a spoof? `` We play it straight, although we sometimes take it to extremes,'' <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> says. `` We've never taken ourselves as seriously as some other shows. ` Knots Landing' is the most reality-based show. We have our own reality, but it's a fictitious reality.'' Next season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> are considering a move away from the serial format. Either every story would begin and end within an episode, or in the manner of `` L.A. Law'' and `` St. Elsewhere,'' some storylines would be resolved and some would carry over a few weeks. `` This show will last as long as the actors want to keep on doing it,'' says <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>' job does n't end when the curtain goes up. During the performance, she's in the dressing room or the wings, ready to do minor touch-ups. As for <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, the makeup is with him for 12 hours on Wednesdays and Saturdays, when he performs twice; seven hours on the four days when he does just one show. At the end of the show, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> applies vast amounts of mineral oil to remove the makeup, which is peeled off gently so as not to irritate the skin. `` There are n't many makeup jobs in theater because nowadays actors learn to do their own makeup,'' says <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> and moved to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to study at Complexions, the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Makeup </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> met <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, the makeup designer, when he spoke at the school. He hired her to work on `` Phantom.'' It was her first job. `` It was quite an extensive training period he put her through,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. `` I remember him throwing all her brushes from college out the door and saying ` What's this, girl? You ca n't use this, girl. It was something out of <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, and I had to sit there absolutely quiet. But it worked.'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> adapted quickly to her on-the-job training. `` We had done a lot of this in theory at school, but in practice I had never done it although I always wanted to get into prosthetic makeup,'' she says. The makeup design for `` Phantom'' was first discussed during the summer of 1986, several months before the show opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at Her Majesty's Theater. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, scenic designer <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjornson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> experimented with many different kinds of makeup. They found they were limited by practical considerations. `` There were restrictions _ not being able to cover the nose because of breathing or going inside the mouth too far because of the singing or covering the ears because it would interfere with listening to the music,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. What the three of them came up with is what <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> tries to recapture at every performance. `` It's interesting. People say ` How can you do the same show every day when you're an actor?''' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. `` It's exactly the same thing with the makeup. It's like painting. Every day is a challenge to paint that picture.''

 Little noticed by the rest of the world, a guerrilla war in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has created a new and serious refugee problem in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, along with its toll in human life and economic loss since it began in 1977. But it also is having a deep impact on <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s black-governed neighbors in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and holds the seeds of an even wider regional conflict, swallowing people already struggling with poverty and drought. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s poorest nation, is on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and provides its black neighbors their only trading outlet, except for nearby <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> But the neighbors' efforts to cut their dependence on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for trade routes by using a corridor through <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have been disrupted by the guerrilla conflict. `` The survival of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is our survival,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> says. `` The fall of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> certainly also will be our fall.'' Here are reports by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondents on how the war is affecting two of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s closest neighbors.

<TEXT>
 In the gnarled branches of ancient baobab trees hundreds of pelicans from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> peacefully nest, giving rise to a local joke that even the birds have fled the civil war next door. During one of the incessant deluges that turn the rich farmland into marshes this time of year, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomo </PERSON> and his family, human refugees from the war in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, huddled around a camp fire beneath the branches of another baobab tree, a temporary home for them and several other families. Rag-clad and diseased, hungry and frightened, more than 400,000 Mozambicans have crossed into neighboring <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> in the past 17 months to escape fighting at home between guerrillas and the government. The refugees have abandoned the poorest country in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for refuge in the region's second poorest nation. `` This is the major refugee problem in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, excluding <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkanda </PERSON>, a Tanzanian who heads the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. `` The pressure on the land is pretty heavy. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> does n't have adequate land for its own people and the refugees are occupying land normally used for farming.'' For generations, Mozambicans have been welcomed visitors across the 1,000 miles of unguarded border they share with the Malawians. But fighting between government troops and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, more commonly known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO, have sent waves of Mozambicans fleeing into <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 and has a government based on Marxist theory. The refugees have put a strain on Malawian resources and caused security problems. Drought last year has forced <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, once one of the <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s few food exporters, to look elsewhere for food to feed its own people Increasingly, men suspected of being <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> fighters have crossed into <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> to steal livestock and relief rations from the refugees. A cattle stealing raid in January ended with the deaths of three Malawian villagers who resisted the raiders, officials said. They were the first Malawian casualties of the cross-border intrusions, which also have cost the lives of several Mozambican refugees. Landlocked <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s smallest and most densely populated countries _ nearly 8 million people in the country about the size of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for Refugees estimates the number of Mozambican refugees in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> will reach a 500,000 by the end of the year. `` Half a million refugees in a small country like <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> is a very big problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION> S.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kamvazina </ORGANIZATION>, principal secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and the chairman of the joint committee responsible for the refugees' care. An estimated 330,000 more Mozambican war refugees are in nearby <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> UNHCR </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the refugees arrive with similar stories of abuse from both sides in the <LOCATION> Mozambican </LOCATION> conflict. Government troops accuse civilians of collaborating with the rebels and take reprisals. <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> fighters, in turn, frequently force villagers to carry supplies on long marches. The civilians who falter or weaken are beaten or killed, some of the refugees have charged. `` Some of the refugees take weeks wandering through the countryside to avoid fighting,'' <PERSON> Mkanda </PERSON> said. For others, it's a short walk across an asphalt ribbon known as M1, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s major north-south road connecting the capital, <LOCATION> Lilongwe </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION>, the country's largest town. For 60 miles, M1 serves as the border between <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Lush fields of maize -LRB- corn -RRB- and other crops crowd both sides of the road. But while mud huts dot the landscape on the Malawian side, abandoned buildings and deserted huts line the Mozambican side. The former owners have fled, taking tin from the roofs and windows from the buildings to use in build new homes on the <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> side of the road. During the day, some Mozambicans venture across the road to work their old fields, but never too far inland to risk running into a rebel or government patrol. Mozambicans living along M1 were among the first to flee the fighting. That first mass movement, in September 1986, brought 40,000 refugees to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. Three months later, the number had nearly doubled and by March 1987 it reached 100,000. Over the next 12 months the refugee population quadrupled. `` It's very difficult for the government to cope with the problem,'' said <PERSON> Kamvanzina </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official. `` We get no notice that tomorrow so many people are coming in.'' More than 168,000 Mozambicans have settled here in the southernmost district of <LOCATION> Nsanje </LOCATION>, the largest refugee concentration. Refugees now outnumber the local population and the surrounding mountainsides are being denuded by the newcomers who fell trees for firewood and huts. Because of the influx _ as many as 100 a day _ it takes up to 10 days for officials to build even temporary shelter for the new arrivals. Many of the refugees in the teeming camp near <LOCATION> Mangkokwe </LOCATION> wear clothing fashioned from burlap sacks that once held their rations. `` Those who are coming in now are in terrible condition _ malnutrition, no clothes, tuberculosis,'' said District Commissioner <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mwanja </PERSON>, the chief government officer for <LOCATION> Nsanje </LOCATION>. `` War has reduced human beings to beasts. If there was a way of ending this thing, it would be very, very nice.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee commission has budgeted $ 13 million for <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> in 1988 _ a `` seriously conservative figure,'' <PERSON> Mkanda </PERSON> said. International aid has started to pour in, including $ 1.2 million from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationnal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` Repatriation is the most durable solution,'' <PERSON> Mkanda </PERSON> said. Nobody expects that soon. `` They might be here for some time _ five years, 10 years,'' <PERSON> Mkanda </PERSON> said. `` Even if there is change tomorrow in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, that does n't mean that everybody will leave.''

<TEXT>
 A decade ago, thousands of guerrillas flooded across the border from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> to mount a final assault against the white-minority government in what then was call <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>. Today, eight years after <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> became black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, battalions of troops, including guerrilla veterans of that independence war, are strung along the same border _ this time to block a new wave of incursions by guerrillas fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s government. The outcome of the guerrillas' strikes in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and inside <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> will have a major impact on the fragile economies of the troubled region in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Several black-ruled states are striving to divert their trade traffic from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ports in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony, in a bid to loosen their economic dependency on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>. The rebels, in turn, vow to continue sabotaging <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s supply lines that also serve <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> So far, the 12,000 to 20,000 guerrillas of the anti-government <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> seem unharried by the conventional forces ranged against them in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> _ some 30,000 Mozambican regulars, more than 12,000 Zimbabweans, 2,000 Tanzanians and a few hundred Malawians. The guerrillas, who call themselves nationalists opposing a Marxist-based government, roam <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 10 provinces and mount frequent raids into <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> with virtual impunity. `` It's very strange being on the other side,'' said a young Zimbabwean corporal who fought the Rhodesians under the name Comrade Hammer. `` We know from our experience it's hard to beat guerrillas. But these people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how they think and what they might do next.'' The guerrillas, known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO, originally were formed by the <LOCATION> Rhodesian </LOCATION> intelligence service in 1977, two years after <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, to harass nationalist guerrillas directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> from inside <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s 1973-79 independence war. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s prime minister at independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in April 1980 and cut support to the Mozambican rebels. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> took over the reins until 1984 when it signed a non-aggression pact with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Since then, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> claims South African support has continued, a charge denied by the South African government. The Mozambican rebels declared war on <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> last year after <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> vowed that a quarter of his forces stationed in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> would fight to keep its government in power. Since then they have stepped up raids along the 750-mile frontier of forested mountains and scrub-dotted plains. Rebels have killed scores of villagers and some security-force militias. They have abducted hundreds of civilians, including children, and marched them at gunpoint into <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, apparently as dragooned recruits. They also have destroyed government schools, clinics and development projects; robbed country stores and remote homesteads of food, drink and clothing; ambushed buses and looted passengers; ordered workers to leave forestry estates, coffee plantations and orchards; rustled cattle, sheep and goats. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> has exhorted his troops `` to erect an impassable defense along our border'' to prevent fresh incursions. He also urged them to renew military efforts inside <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> `` to completely deny the enemy any ... chance to sabotage our arteries to the sea.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujuru </PERSON>, a wartime guerrilla chieftain and now <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s army commander, called on civilians living along the frontier to report people they suspect might have links to the guerrillas. But <PERSON> Mujuru </PERSON> said Zimbabwean troops had gained the upper hand in counterinsurgency operations since the first major incursions eight months ago. Before June, <PERSON> Mujuru </PERSON>'s soldiers and the rebels clashed only in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Since then, troops of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s new 5,000-member 6th Brigade have reinforced border defenses, militias are guarding farms, villages, schools and clinics and cross-border movement has been banned except at established immigration posts. Anti-personnel mines have been sown where guerrillas are thought to cross into Zimbabwqe and the identification papers of some 65,000 Mozambican refugees in three camps are being screened by local authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, courts have cracked down on local peasants suspected of links to the insurgents. Early in February, a <LOCATION> Mutare </LOCATION> judge sent a woman to prison for six years and a man for five years for failing to report the presence of bandits to officials. At stake in the conflict is not only the survival of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, its economy already in ruins as a result of fighting and famine. Also at issue is the fate of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Beira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corridor </ORGANIZATION>, a 186-mile trade route that meanders through mountains, fertile valleys and swamps from the Zimbabwean border city to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. A fifth of the overseas trade of the black-ruled neighbor states flows along the corridor's railroads and highways. Landlocked <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> receives most of its fuel suppliers from a corridor pipeline despite repeated sabotage by the guerrillas. Most of that trade and oil previously went through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have rejected suggestions that they hold peace talks with the guerrillas, arguing that the rebels are puppets of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government and have no support from either the East or the West <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, at the graduation ceremony for the 6th Brigade in September, said he was forced to form the unit because of what he called South African destabilization in the region. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s subversion of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s ... sovereignity had the potential to completely deny us any routes to the sea,'' <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said. `` The survival of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is our survival,'' <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said. `` The fall of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> certainly also will be our fall.''

 The nation that wants to turn the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> into a `` zone of peace'' has just acquired a nuclear submarine to add to its two aircraft carriers and 110 other naval vessels. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s acquisition last month of the nuclear submarine from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is part of a naval expansion since failing in its efforts of almost 20 years to clear the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> of big-power navies. The expansion has aroused criticism from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has warships in the ocean along with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Within the past two years, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also has acquired five conventional submarines, its second aircraft carrier and at least five Indian-built navy ships. It has plans to buy more _ including possibly other <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear subs _ and to build warships ranging from submarines to another aircraft carrier for its fleet. `` It's the full range of naval warfare. They're building a first-class navy,'' a Western naval analyst said. When the 47,000-member Indian navy got the carrier <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last year and renamed it Viraat -LRB- Imposing -RRB-, the chief of naval staff at the time, Adm. <PERSON> R.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahiliani </PERSON>, said: `` We finally have a round-the-clock blue -LRB- deep -RRB- water navy.'' While greater naval strength seems to belie <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s pleas before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a zone of peace in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, it matches the country's growing might. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also has a 1-million-man army, the world's fourth largest, and is acquiring modern weapons. Each step up, however, is ascribed to the need to match the growing arsenals of others, chiefly neighboring rivals <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but also the Western powers. `` The strategies of outside powers in our region have forced upon us expenditure in building military strength which we would much rather have deployed for the removal of poverty,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said as the nuclear sub Chakra was commissioned. `` The <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> has been militarized and infested with nuclear weapons flouting the overwhelming sentiment within the region in favor of establishing a zone of peace.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> first proposed a zone of peace for the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in the early 1970s, and the Non-Aligned Movement -LRB- Third World -RRB- endorsed the concept. The proposal then went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1971 adopted a declaration calling for a peace zone and urging the dismantling of big powers' air and naval bases in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. But a planned <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference on the issue has never been held, although a committee has been meeting in hopes of bringing one about by 1990. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has endorsed the idea, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s naval buildup initially was attributed to the development of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base in the early 1980s at <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, an island in the <LOCATION> Chagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archipelago </LOCATION> about 1,000 miles southwest of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. An Indian naval expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe his nation faces a real threat from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or other Western ships protecting oil shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but he added: `` If you have troubled waters close to home, you think about what you might have to do.'' He said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> believed more sea power was needed to protect its 4,937 miles of coastline and to keep a competitive edge in naval technology. Of the newly acquired nuclear sub, he said: `` It's a system without which a navy is not viable. It takes the game to a new step altogether.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has condemned the acquisition of the sub as an escalation of the military buildup in the region. Press reports say <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with no nuclear submarine, is pressing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for P-3 anti-submarine aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s acquisition of a nuclear sub `` clearly introduces a new weapons technology into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> region. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is opposed to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> having a nuclear submarine because of a lack of safeguards, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added. Neither <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device in 1974, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is thought to be on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. Both nations say their nuclear plans are peaceful in design. The new Chakra submarine, for the moment leased by the Soviets to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> navy, is not believed to carry nuclear weapons. The Western naval analyst, who insisted his name not be used, said the Charlie I class sub is `` 1960s technology. It's an old boat.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s second aircraft carrier, the Viraat, was originally commissioned in 1959, and the Western expert noted that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> `` does not have enough planes for one carrier, let alone two.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, however, is buying <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harrier </LOCATION> aircraft and Sea King commando helicopters for its carriers. It also has bought three late-1970s vintage Kilo class Soviet submarines and two West German HDW 209s, called `` search and kill subs,'' to update its fleet of eight Soviet-made Foxtrot subs. In addition, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is upgrading its three shipyards to build warships and constructing its largest naval base near <LOCATION> Karwar </LOCATION>, 285 miles south of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> on the west coast. There are reports the navy is expanding an existing base on its far-flung <LOCATION> Nicobar </LOCATION> islands, 1,035 miles from the country's southern tip but only about 100 miles from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The Indian naval expert saw these developments in light of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s need to protect itself. `` You need military power for your own security, not that you have expansionist ambitions,'' he said. His Western counterpart said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s rationale for an expanding navy was its view of itself as the regional power of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Indian navy men also see themselves as heirs to British sea power from the days when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> controlled the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to protects its trade routes to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the Western analyst said. `` They want a navy they can operate throughout the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The Brits were there before. They want to be there too.''

 Wednesday is the 20th anniversary of the massacre of civilians by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops at the Vietnamese village of My <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION>. The writer, who covered the Vietnam War as an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent for 10 years and was the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s last <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> bureau chief, returned to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> a decade after the war ended and visited My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> in December 1984.

 At 7:22 on a Saturday morning 20 years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> lifted off in helicopters with rifles on their arms and revenge in their hearts. The infantrymen were on a mission to My Lai that would become synonymous with shame and cover-up. Two minutes after they were airborne on that day, March 16, 1968, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> artillery guns firing in support from Landing Zone Uptight indiscriminately shelled the village. Helicopter gunships raked the landing zone with rockets and machine gun fire. The thundering artillery, the whistling rockets and the steady clatter of machine guns sent villagers who had been working in the rice paddies diving for cover along the dikes and in the buffalo pits in the fields. Others, like <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON>, then a 10-year-old schoolgirl, and her family, took refuge in homemade shelters in front of their huts. As the troop-carrying helicopters from Task Force <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> made their final approach, smoke from fires touched off by the artillery poured into the skies. At 7:30, the first troops landed, aroused about a grudge operation aimed at evening the score for the American casualties suffered from mines, booby traps and snipers. `` The attitude of all the men, the majority, I would say, was a revengeful attitude,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> in testimony at a military inquiry into the My Lai assault. `` They all felt a little bad because -LRB- we -RRB- lost a number of buddies to <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>.'' `` People were talking about killing everything that moved,'' recalled another participant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>. `` Everyone knew what we were going to do.'' They had been briefed the day before on their target: the 48th <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> local force battalion, perhaps as many as 250 troops that intelligence said posed a threat to the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Quang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ngai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 6 miles away. Their mission: to destroy their supply base and staging area. `` When we left the briefing, we felt we were going to have a lot of resistance and we knew we were supposed to kill everyone in the village,'' recalled <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. Capt. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, the commander of <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, told his troops the civilians would be on their way to the local marketplaces in <LOCATION> Quang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ngai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by 7 a.m. But that was not the case. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Company </PERSON>'s 1st Platoon, led by Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calley </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, moved into My Lai firing at fleeing Vietnamese, throwing grenades into houses and bunkers, and slaughtering animals. `` We heard the sound of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers,'' <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> told a reporter years later. `` People hiding in the shelter got out as they usually did when Americans entered the village.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops ordered her family and four neighbors to the front of the house, she said. She hid in a bedroom. `` They shot to death three cows first,'' she said. `` Then they knelt and shot my family. People tried to run away. My parents, six brothers and sisters, grandmother and aunt and uncle were killed.'' After shooting her mother, she said, the Americans placed straw on the woman and lighted it. She said that when her 14-year-old sister ran from the burning kitchen of their home, laughing soldiers forced her back into the fire. <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> ran to her 76-year-old grandmother's house and found her body partly inside a clothes cupboard where she had tried to hide. <PERSON> Vo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>, then 11, was in a shelter with her grandparents. `` I saw three American soldiers point guns and shoot into the shelter and then throw grenades into it and hit my grandmother,'' she said. Numbed and unable to find a way out of the collapsing shelter, she and her grandfather finally were rescued by some villagers. By the time <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Company </PERSON> left My Lai in the early afternoon, its troops had killed at least 175-200 Vietnamese men, women and children, according to the 1970 report of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> inquiry headed by the late Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peers </PERSON>. `` The evidence indicates that only three or four were confirmed as <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON>, although there were undoubtedly several unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> men, women and children among them and many more active supporters and sympathizers,'' the Peers Report said. Separate estimates by the Criminal Investigation Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> together with other evidence indicated more than 400 civilians were killed. A plaque in My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> is inscribed with the names of 504 men, women and children Vietnamese officials say died in the massacre. The only American casualty reported in <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Company </PERSON> was a soldier who was wounded by the discharge of his rifle. Members of <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>'s platoon testified before the Peers inquiry that an old man was bayoneted to death and another man was thrown alive into a well and killed with a hand grenade. Of <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>, the central figure of My Lai, the Peers Report said: `` He directed and supervised the men of his platoon in the systematic killing of many non-combatants in and around My <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION>. He personally participated in the killing of some non-combatants.'' Of the leader of the 2nd Platoon, Lt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, one of four officers involved in May <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> who were killed in action in the following months, the report said: `` He directed and supervised the men of his platoon in the systematic killing of at least 60 to 70 non-combatants. Although he knew that a number of his men habitually raped Vietnamese women in villages during operations, on 16 March, 1968, he observed, did not prevent, and failed to report several rapes by members of his platoon while in My Lai ... and <PERSON> Binh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tay </PERSON>.'' Some Vietnamese were spared by the courage of an American helicopter pilot who threatened to fire on his fellow soldiers if they harmed a group of 12 to 16 Vietnamese women, children and old men cowering in a bunker. Warrant Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> landed his helicopter near the bunker and ordered his crew to fire on the American infantrymen if they fired on the Vietnamese while he was trying to get them evacuated. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he asked a lieutenant to help get the women and children out, and the infantry officer replied that the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> snapped back at the lieutenant: `` Just hold your men right where they are and I'll get the kids out.'' The Vietnamese were safely evacuated.

 The outside world knew nothing of My Lai for more than a year. The Peers inquiry cited 28 officers ranging from generals to enlisted men for covering up the massacre. On March 29, 1969, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenhour </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, sent letters to 30 military and congressional leaders saying he had heard many reports from soldiers who had served in Charlie Company that something `` very black'' had happened in My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> and a public investigation should be made. Eight months later, on Nov. 24, 1969, <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was ordered court-martialed on charges of premeditated murder of 109 Vietnamese. `` If I have committed a crime,'' <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> said in his defense, `` the only crime that I have committed is in judgment of my values. Apparently I have valued my troops' lives more than I did that of the enemy. When my troops were getting massacred and mauled by an enemy I could n't see, I could n't feel and I could n't touch; that nobody in the military ever described as anything other than communism. `` They did n't give it a race, they did n't give it a sex, they did n't give it an age. They never let me believe it was just a philosophy in a man's mind. That was my enemy out there and when it came between me and that enemy, I had to value the lives of my troops, and I feel that is the only crime I have committed.'' In March 1971, a jury of six senior officers convicted <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> of first-degree murder of at least 22 villagers, including a boy fleeing in terror whom <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> tossed into a ditch and shot. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was ordered to spend life in prison. His conviction and sentence touched off a public outcry in his support including national petition campaigns, angry speeches in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and appeals to President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to pardon him. Five months later, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> reduced his sentence to 20 years. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> actually served three years under house arrest at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, Ga. He was released when his conviction was overturned by a federal district judge, and he was not returned to house arrest when the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the conviction. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was the only soldier convicted in the My Lai massacre, but it became the graveyard for several Army careers. Initially, 25 officers and enlisted men were charged, 13 of them accused of direct involvement in the killing. But only six were actually tried, including <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, the company commander. The highest ranking officer tried, Col. <PERSON> Oran </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade, of which <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Company </PERSON> was a part, was acquitted of charges of failing to conduct an investigation after he was told civilians had been killed. Administrative action was taken against two generals, one of them demoted and the other censured. The Peers Report said no single factor by itself was the cause of My <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION>. The battle plan by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, commander of the task force bearing his name, contained inaccurate intelligence on the strength and whereabouts of the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> and wrongly assumed no civilians would be in the area, the report said. It said <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> and his subordinates failed to make any clear distinction between soldiers and civilians. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> was killed in a helicopter crash three months later. The report said many men in Charlie Company disliked and mistreated Vietnamese civilians and did not trust them because they failed to warn the Americans of mines and booby traps, which took a heavy toll of casualties, frustrating and demoralizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Another contributing factor, the report said, was the attitude of South Vietnamese officials themselves toward the My <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION> area, which they considered Viet Cong-controlled territory and treated as a free fire zone with little concern about the villagers. This attitude rubbed off on the Americans, the report said. Although atrocities were committed by both sides in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> shocked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a nation that took pride in fighting by the rules of war. Today, My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> is a memorial to its victims. The bodies of the men, women and children rest in the cemeteries and surrounding fields. In the center of the village is a large statue of a woman holding a child in her left arm. At her feet are victims of the massacre. My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> was reborn when the war ended in 1975. Twenty years after the attack, it is alive again with the scent of flowers in bloom and the laughter of a new generation of children.

 A score of springs have come and gone for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadlo </PERSON> since he left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But time has not dulled his memory of My Lai. `` I got a permanent reminder,'' said <PERSON> Meadlo </PERSON> in a telephone interview from his home in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` I got my foot blowed off the very next morning. It must have been God's plan.'' <PERSON> Meadlo </PERSON> was a 21-year-old rifleman on March 16, 1968, when <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> swept through the village of My Lai and killed at least 175-200 men, women and children. Granted immunity, he testified at the court-martial of his platoon leader, Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, that he helped <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> shoot some of them because as far as he was concerned they were <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just something you've got to live with,'' he said. `` It's rough Eventually you just got to cross it out of your mind and go on with your life.'' <PERSON> Meadlo </PERSON>, now 41, said that when he first left the Army it was hard to get a job because of the loss of his right foot to a mine. `` I'm still bitter about this forever.'' He eventually landed a job with a company that makes plastic film and has been there nearly 20 years. He has a 20-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter, both of whom are in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Four other men involved in My Lai were killed in action in the months afterward, including Lt. Col. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who planned the operation. Like Meadlo, My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> left its imprint on the others who survived and forever changed their lives. For <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, the commander of <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, it meant the end of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> career. `` I had to resign my commission and get out, setting aside 16 -LCB- years service,'' <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> recently. Even though he was acquitted in a court-martial, his career was ruined. <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> moved with his wife and three children to <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in 1971. He worked as a salesman for a helicopter manufacturer for a time, but for 10 years has been in the real estate business. His two youngest sons are in the service. Now 51, <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> looks back on My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> as a `` horrendous thing'' that never should have happened. `` I have regrets for it but I have no guilt over it because I did n't cause it,'' he said. `` That's not what the military, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, is trained for. `` But then again, maybe the war should have never happened,'' he said. `` I think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, I'm sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it otherwise Maybe it was a war that we should have probably never gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.'' <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said that in looking for the cause of My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> there is a need to look at the whole Vietnam War. `` It's just totally different,'' he said. `` There were no front lines. It was n't a conventional type war. It was a guerrilla war. It's something I feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot of the officers were not trained. I'm talking not just about lieutenants. I'm talking about senior officers ...'' Another soldier who was court-martialed and acquitted, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON>, now lives with his family in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, where he works as a television repairman. Now 39, he was a 19-year-old sergeant at My Lai. Asked the lessons of My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>, he said, `` Give young boys time to grow up mentally before you send them to fight a war.'' <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> said he has overcome a drinking problem that developed as he tried `` to cope with what happened in my life during that time and wondering how come it did n't happen to someone else. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.'' <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>, the central figure in My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>, declined to talk to a reporter, maintaining the silence he has kept over the years. Now 44, he works in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, with his father-in-law, V.V. <PERSON> Vick </PERSON>, owner of a jewelry store. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>, the only soldier convicted in the case, served three years under house arrest at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, Ga. The man who exposed My Lai, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenhour </PERSON>, was never there. Now 41, he is an investigative reporter for CityBusiness, a biweekly newspaper in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. He recently won a Polk Award for local reporting for a yearlong investigation of a city tax scandal. But 20 years ago, he was a door gunner on an observation helicopter that flew over the village a few days after the massacre. It was his conscience that drove him to blow the whistle, but he waited for several months until he was out of the service because he feared for his life. He learned what had happened at My Lai a month later when he was transferred to a long-range reconnaissance patrol and was reunited with half a dozen of his friends from training camp who had been at the village with <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. They told him the story. In March of 1969, four months after his discharge, he sent letters to 30 military and congressional leaders detailing what he had been told. `` There's no question I had to turn in my friends,'' he said. `` But it was that or be part of their crime. I believe, though, that they are also victims that maybe carried the brunt of of what was really an official policy. I do n't regret it. It exposed the truth. I did n't think people had massacres like My Lai in mind when they supported the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.''

 After a two-month fight that saw <ORGANIZATION> IU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly spurn buyout offers from <ORGANIZATION> Neoax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the diversified companies have agreed to a merger valued at nearly $ 610 million. The companies announced Sunday that <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON> had agreed to pay $ 22.25 per share for each of <ORGANIZATION> IU </ORGANIZATION>'s 27.4 million common shares outstanding. <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based manufacturing concern, had sweetened its offer on Friday from $ 22 per share, and the two sides began negotiating an agreement, the companies said in a joint news release. IU's board of directors, which had recommended its stockholders ignore <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON>'s earlier bids, unanimously endorsed the latest offer. IU shares rose 12 -LCB- cents to $ 22 Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Neoax rose $ 1.75 to $ 9.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading. IU, a <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, diversified services company with executive offices in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, had been fighting Neoax since Jan. 6, when the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> firm launched a $ 17.50-a-share offer for IU. <LOCATION> IU </LOCATION> on Feb. 23 agreed to a $ 21.50 a share leveraged buyout led by members of management and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON> quickly raised its bid to $ 22 a share and the leveraged buyout proposal later was withdrawn. <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON>'s new offer will expire at 9 a.m. EST March 21, according to <LOCATION> Neoax </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansi </PERSON>. As of Sunday, <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON> had received tenders of about 1.2 million IU shares under its tender offer. IU was founded 64 years ago in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as a holding company for electric and gas utilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. By the early 1980s the company had evolved into one of the country's biggest trucking companies Its current businesses include paper and food distribution, trucking and environmental services, including waste management and slag recovery at steel mills. <PERSON> Neoax </PERSON> is the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of large trucks. It sought protection under Chapter 11 of of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in 1980, emerging 3 -LCB- years later as <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Axle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was changed to <LOCATION> Neoax </LOCATION> in 1986.

The 1987 results included a $ 12.7 million loss on the sale of certain operations, while the 1986 results included a $ 12.8 million gain from the sale of some operations, a $ 40 million tax credit and a $ 1.8 million gain from an accounting change. Profits from continuing operations rose to $ 28.6 million from $ 22.4 million in 1986.

 Italian investor <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> on Monday named new international partners to help him in his bid for control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the French investment firm through which <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION> is vying for control of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company, said the alliance controlled 47.01 percent of share capital of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. The group is opposed by a Franco-Belgian alliance which claims a majority stake of 52 percent. For the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> said the Swiss bank <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cite </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> FAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> company and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> were helping its bid for control of the company which has a stake in a third of the Belgian economy. Earlier known partners are the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Swiss bank <ORGANIZATION> Companie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> et d'Investissements and two Belgian partners. On Monday, the Dutch technology giant <ORGANIZATION> N.V. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> and the Swiss food company <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> were invited to become partners. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> have formed the holding company <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1992 in support of their bid. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1992 refers to the date when goods, services and people should be able to move without restrictions in the 12-nation European Economic Community. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> wants to turn <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> in a pan-European holding company. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s rival group is formed around <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, and the French investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Companie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>. That group wants to keep the 166-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> firmly anchored in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Both sides have said they wanted to discuss the future of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. But the Franco-Belgian alliance has said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> must first renounce his ambition to take a leading role in the company and stressed it could also act unilaterally. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> still has a public offer going for more shares to get control of the company. But to extend his offer he needed to name his allies. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> said within its alliance, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1992 had 15.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s 28.2 million shares, <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> 11.72 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION>, 9.02 percent, <ORGANIZATION> BFC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAI </ORGANIZATION> each 3.24 percent, Odyssey 0.97 percent and others 2.92 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> said this breakdown did not include the initial results of its bid for an additional 7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> was told to name his allies by <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s banking commission, a regulatory agency, as a condition for getting approval to extend the bid. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has a stake in some 1,400 companies around the world and has important interests in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s energy sector, technology development, strategic resources and the nation's relationship with its former colony <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has proposed amending the national constitution to protect the rights of private businesses and permit the transfer of land-use rights, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The report said the amendments would ensure privately owned entities, an increasingly important sector in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> economy, the right to exist and develop as a complement to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s socialist system. Private businesses, defined as individually owned enterprises with eight or more workers, have existed since 1981, two years after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> launched economic reform programs based on encouraging personal initiative and a market-oriented economy.

 The majority of Japanese responding to an opinion poll favored accepting temporary foreign workers into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if their skills and effciency are needed, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. An agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 11.0 percent of those responding thought <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should allow temporary foreign laborers, such as construction workers, waiters, maids and waitresses, to find work in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> without any conditions. He said 63 percent said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should accept foreign workers under certain conditions. Only 4.8 percent opposed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s acceptance of any foreign workers at all, the official said The agency questioned 3,000 people aged 20 or over and 1,000 firms throughout the nation at random last October. Among Japanese firms that had employed foreign workers, 62.7 percent of those responding said they would employ them in the future, while 3.1 percent said they would not employ them any more. The others said they did not know. Of the Japanese firms that never had employed foreign workers, 21.9 percent of those responding said they would employ them in the future and 29.9 percent said they would not.

 Italian tire manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> today launched a $ 1.86 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, complicating <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to sell 75 percent of its tire-making division to <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>, in an advertisement in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, offered $ 58 a share cash for all 32 million Firestone common shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement today its offer was conditioned on acquiring at least two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, on the agreement beween <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> not being signed and on the removal of Firestone's anti-takeover defenses. `` We wo n't have anything more to say until the board has had an opportunity to make a review. I would expect that would begin immediately,'' Firestone spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, home of Firestone's corporate headquarters. An acquisition of Firestone would substantially increase <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s current 1.5 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tire market, the world's largest. It would also give the Italian company its first manufacturing facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Wall Street analysts had speculated on Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> would make an offer for Firestone. Firestone's stock leaped $ 11.37 -LCB- a share in early trading today to $ 61 a share, above <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 58-a-share offer, indicating that speculators expected an even higher offer to emerge. Firestone stock closed at $ 49.62 -LCB- Friday, up $ 5.50 for the week in heavy trading. Nearly 4.2 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock changed hands last week, compared with about 850,000 in an average week. It was not immediately clear what effect an investment or takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> would have on the pending proposed joint venture between Firestone and <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Firestone's board and ultimately shareholders will have to decide which offer to <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> could block the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> deal if it was able to purchase a sufficient number of Firestone shares. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> said today that if it was successful in its bid for Firestone, it would spin off parts of the company to the French group <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> would pay about $ 650 million to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s Brazilian holdings as well as <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service company, <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> would also have an option to buy 50 percent of Firestone's synthetic rubber and diversified product holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for about $ 150 million. On Feb. 16, <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said they intended to form a new Akron-based tire business, to be called <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, that would own <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide tire manufacturing operation. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> would own 75 percent of the joint venture. Firestone Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> has said the company wants to distribute to shareholders `` a very substantial portion'' of about $ 1 billion in cash that would be generated by the joint venture. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> has been considered an attractive target for both foreign-based companies because of their interest in gaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share. <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> officials were notified upon learning of possible action by <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. At the time the $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> deal was announced, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s board approved an anti-takeover measure that took effect Tuesday. That measure would raise the cost of a takeover by creating a special class of preferred stock in the event an individual or group acquired 20 percent or more, or made a tender offer for 20 percent or more, of Firestone's stock without approval of the board. In a letter to shareholders released last week, <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said the anti-takeover plan was not intended to prevent a fair offer for the shares of the company and should not deter anyone from acquiring the company if the buyer gives shareholders full value and negotiates in good faith. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, had sales of $ 3.65 billion last year.

<HEAD>Supreme Court To Hear Merger Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to take a bigger tax bite out of some corporate mergers. The court said it will review a ruling stemming from the acquisition of a small <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company by a corporation traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The smaller company, <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was owned by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buckhannon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> It provides services to the petroleum industry. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> sold the business in 1979 to N.L. Industries of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which produces petroleum equipment, chemicals and metals. N.L. Industries gave <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> 300,000 shares of its stock and $ 3.25 million to acquire Basin Surveys. At issue in the case was whether the cash payment, commonly called `` boot,'' should be taxed as a capital gain or considered a dividend and taxed as ordinary income. Generally, the capital gain tax rate is lower. The tax reform bill enacted in 1986 eliminated the different tax rates for capital gains and ordinary income. But the administration said the different treatment will still apply to some corporate shareholders. Also, in urging the court to consider the government appeal, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sometime in the future might restore for all taxpayers the different treatment of ordinary income and capital gains. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in favor of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> last September, sparing him from paying $ 972,505 in taxes. The appeals court said, `` We regard the boot as a cash payment by N.L. in return for <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s relinquishment of a portion of his interest in the newly reorganized corporation. Because <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> surrendered more than 20 percent of his interest in N.L., he is entitled to capital gain treatment.'' The appeals court arrived at the 20 percent figure by noting that N.L. Industries offere <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> two choices in the merger: he could receive either 425,000 shares of N.L. stock or 300,000 shares plus $ 3.25 million in cash. The appeals court said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, by choosing the latter option, in effect gave up more than 20 percent of his interest in <LOCATION> N.L </LOCATION>. Industries in return for the cash. The appeals court said that under federal law a shareholder who relinquishes more than 20 percent of his corporate control and is less than a 50 percent shareholder after the transaction is entitled to have cash proceeds from the transaction treated as capital gains. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the ruling is in conflict with decisions by other federal appeals courts. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should eliminate the confusion. The case is Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 87-1168.

 <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, wounded from possibly uncollectable Third World loans, is seeking to sell its profitable consumer finance unit to raise capital, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Quoting banking sources it did not identify, the newspaper said the nation's sixth-largest banking concern is asking between $ 500 million and $ 600 million for <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pa.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has about $ 3 billion in assets. The banking company has been forced to take austerity measures because of a $ 1.14 billion loss last year, due mainly to a $ 1.7 billion addition to reserves that reflected the questionable collectability of some Third World loans, a problem afflicting many American banks. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, a Manufacturers Hanover spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he could not comment on the Journal report. But he said the bank has consistently stated it would rebuild capital partly via property sales and expense cuts. `` We've said all along there is a host of assets we can realize gains on,'' <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. `` It is part of our game plan to get shareholder equity replenished.'' Banking industry analysts have said Manufacturers Hanover's consumer finance business is considered highly prized and profitable within the company, so a sale would reflect on the seriousness of the bank's capital needs On the other hand, the consumer finance unit is a stand-alone operation, so it could be sold much more easily that other company property.

<TEXT>
 Production in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> paper industry appears poised for a third consecutive record-breaking year as demand remains strong for all major grades of paper and paperboard, an industry trade association said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association for American pulp, paper and paperboard companies, said production is running at a rate of 75 million tons a year, or about 3 percent above its pace at the same point last year. Production for all of 1987 amounted to a record 74.4 million tons, up from 70.9 million tons in 1986, and is expected to rise by about 2 percent in 1988, according to figures supplied by the trade association. The group's forecast was released as it began its national conference. The institute's president, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cavaney </ORGANIZATION>, said the forecast for 1988 presumes avoiding a recession, a pro-growth trade policy, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax increases. Last year was also a record in terms of the dollar value of paper and paperboard sales, the group said. It said it expects final figures for 1987 will show sales of about $ 87 billion, or 16 percent more than the previous high of $ 74.8 billion set in 1986. The paper industry derived its strength in 1987 from heightened demand in the various markets its serves, the institute said. Demand for white papers, for instance, reflected trends such as increased use of office copy and computer printout papers and of envelopes. Strength in direct-mail advertising helped fuel robust growth in commercial printing, stimulating printing paper demand, the paper institute said. Paperboard production set a record last year as packaged goods production surged, triggering increased demand for paper used for shipping containers, folding cartons and fiber cans, the institute said. Newspapers and the high quality color-printed advertising pieces that retailers and businesses use to reach their customers performed strongly in 1987, the group said, pushing newsprint production to a new high last year. Exports of market pulp and paper products reached a high in 1987 as a decline in the dollar made them more competitive with prices charged overseas, the institute said. While sales surged in 1987, so did the profits of paper companies that had already begun aggressive cost-containment programs, the institute said. It said after-tax profits in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> paper industry rose 56 percent in the first three quarters of 1987, reaching a decade high of 5.7 percent of sales.

The court, voting 8-0, ruled against an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> conglomerate that sought to claim as an ordinary-loss deduction for federal tax purposes a $ 10 million loss from the sale of stock in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank it once controlled. <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in 1969 had acquired more than 65 percent of the stock of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the fourth largest bank in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law in 1970 that prohibited conglomerates that owned a bank from expanding their non-bank business through new acquisitions in other industries. <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION>, which owns trucking, furniture manufacturing, data processing and other businesses, decided to divest itself of the bank stock. The 1970 law gave it 10 years to sell the bank stock. Because of public awareness that <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> was under legal obligation to divest itself, disposing of the bank stock without taking a big loss was difficult. At the same time, the bank's finances were deteriorating. <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> therefore acquired additional stock in the bank in an attempt to keep it solvent. The conglomerate began selling off the bank stock in 1975, and sought to claim the losses as ordinary losses rather than capital losses _ a tax advantage. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the losses suffered by <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> were capital losses. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION>'s arguments that the stock was not bought for typical investment purposes but for business purposes _ and therefore its sale should yield ordinary losses The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> but other federal appeals courts had reached conflicting conclusions. Writing for the high court today, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said motivation behind the stock purchase is irrelevant `` to the question whether the asset is property held by a taxpayer ... and is thus within -LRB- federal tax law's -RRB- general definition of capital asset.'' `` Because the capital stock held by -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- falls within the broad definition of the term ` capital asset' in -LRB- the tax code -RRB- and is outside the classes of property excluded from capital-asset status, the loss arising from the sale of the stock is a capital loss,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the decision. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 86-751.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices and interest rates stabilized in quiet early trading today following Friday's sell-off. `` The market seems to be on dead center right now,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Farnham </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment and mutual-fund management firm. `` There does n't seem to be any news affecting the market.'' By midday, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond was up about 1-32 point while its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to 8.46 percent from 8.47 percent late Friday. The bellwether issue had plunged about two points, or $ 20 per $ 1,000 in face amount, on Friday, after the government reported unexpectedly high February employment levels, raising doubts about forecasts of an economic slowdown later this year. The government said the economy created half a million jobs last month, dropping the civilian unemployment rate to 5.7 percent, its lowest since 1979. The January rate had been 5.8 percent. Front said the market was currently involved in a `` tug of war'' of sorts on the outlook for interest rates. `` The bulls point to lower commodity prices _ the price of gold continues to fall, oil prices continue to slip _ and other signs of weakness in economic activity,'' he said. `` The bears look at the employment numbers ... which were shockingly good and say ... the economy is likely to accelerate. `` I think a lot of people are going back to their drawing boards.'' Interest rates have fallen sharply since fears of recession surfaced after the stock market crash five months ago. But bondholders worry that with some signs of economic growth, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may want to tighten its credit policies, thus pushing interest rates higher, to prevent inflation from heating up. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds today, prices of short-term governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities rose 1-32 point and 20-year issues were off 1-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.01 to 113.3. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, lost 0.04 to 1,183.34. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged in light trading, according to the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was off 0.06 to 284.36 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were up 2 basis points to 5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills - fell 1 basis point to 5.94 percent and one-year bills were unchanged at 6.27 percent The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 6 9-16 percent, up from 6 -LCB- percent late Friday.

<HEAD>Third Qtr Earnings Up 22 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leading foodmaker H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 22 percent surge in third-quarter earnings Monday, attributing the improvement to higher sales volume, acquisitions and the beneficial effects of a cheaper dollar. The company said earnings for the three months ended Jan. 27 totaled $ 91 million or 69 cents a share, compared with $ 74.7 million or 55 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Sales totaled $ 1.25 billion vs. $ 1.08 billion, a 15 percent rise. `` We are encouraged by the earnings record achieved to date through our existing business base as well as the superior market opportunities offered by our strategic world-wide acquisitions,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J.F </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>. `` We are optimistic that we will again achieve fiscal year results consisted with our historical trends.'' The Pittsburgh-based company embarked on a series of acquisitions last year, notably in the pet-food business, in which it bought <LOCATION> Mavar </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, two American concerns. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> also recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, an important Spanish food company. The dollar's depreciation also helped <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> because its U.S.-produced foods became more competitive overseas. At the same time, profits from goods produced and sold by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s foreign operations rose when converted into dollars. For the nine-months ended Jan. 27, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said it earned $ 284.3 million or $ 2.14 a share, a 16.3 percent gain over the $ 244.4 million or $ 1.78 a share in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 13 percent from $ 3.3 billion to $ 3.8 billion.

 The stock market drifted in a narrow range today amid concern over the interest-rate outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.48 to 2,053.38 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 705 up, 690 down and 469 unchanged. Prices and interest rates showed little change in the bond market today. But developments late last week raised concern that the drop in interest rates since last fall had about run its course. Rates rose sharply on Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported much stronger growth in employment than expected for February. If the economy is robust enough to support a big increase in jobs, credit-market traders reason, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to take any further steps soon to relax its credit policy. Given that prospect, investors seemed to be focusing their attention mainly on numerous stocks involved in takeovers and other deals. <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Rubber jumped 11 -RRB- to 61. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> made a $ 58-a-share bid to acquyire the company, which is planning to sell its tire business to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> climbed 10 -RCB- to 48 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 45-a-share offer for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, which previously agreed to be taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 37.50 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 to 44 | in active trading The company said it had reached a definitive agreement to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to a group led by <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s top management. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .13 to 150.30.

<TEXT>
 Spurred by the low dollar and cheaper air fares, Europeans from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> are rediscovering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at a record pace. Tourist visa applications are flooding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulates across <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and tour operators say the number of bookings to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is up sharply from last year's record. `` The numbers -LRB- of visa applicants -RRB- are increasing dramatically,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, chief of the non-immigrant visa branch at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON>, chief of consular services at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said the consulate issued about 600,000 tourist visas last year. `` We expect a 30 percent to 50 percent rise this year, and this pretty much reflects the rest of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Association of <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which includes 21 major airline companies, said the total number of Europeans flying to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has increased about 48 percent since 1985. According to the most recent statistics available to the Brussels-based association, 7.2 million Europeans took flights to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from January to October 1987. Officials across <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> polled by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> said the first two months of this year indicate that 1988 will be a boom year for travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> provide the bulk of tourists visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the two countries are expected to combine for nearly 2 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trips this year. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the number of non-immigrant visas issued in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was expected to reach 900,000 this year from 642,000 in 1987. January saw a 69 percent increase in non-immigant visas over January 1987, and February figures rose 66 percent over the same month last year, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>, owner of American Round-up, a travel agency in <LOCATION> Hemel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said her business was flourishing. `` The growth in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> travel because of the dollar recently is tremendous. In the last three months I've had the same amount of business as all last year,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>, whose agency specializes in adventure vacations to the Western states. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the dollar has dropped 50 percent in three years, travel agencies also are thriving as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tours become cheaper. `` Our January figures are 25 percent over last January's when we had 25,705 bookings,'' said <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielander </PERSON> of Deutsches Reisebuero, a travel agency. His agency offers two-week trips to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for $ 1,000 dollars, only $ 350 more than a two-week stay at a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> resort. The Swiss are also frequent international travelers: 235,000 of them visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, a 27 percent increase over 1986. A further rise is expected this year. In <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> said bookings for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations were up 30 percent this year compared with 1987. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Pantelides </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Manos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s largest travel agency, said the dollar's drop was a windfall for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trips `` America is much better value for money compared to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said there has been a 12 percent increase in the past five months in tourist visa applications for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with the same period in 1987. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reported a 60 percent to 70 percent rise in the number of visa applications, and in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> they said it was up 38 percent in the last five months.

 Script writers struck movie and television producers today and the union predicted viewers of talk shows, game shows and daytime soaps would quickly notice a difference in programming. Hundreds of writers grabbed `` The Writers Guild Strikes'' placards depicting a quill and lightning bolt as mid-morning picket lines snaked in front of Twentieth Century Fox studios. The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> rejected a final offer presented Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> and called a walkout for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. The 600 <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> news writers are exempt from this action. The strike began here and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at 9 a.m. PST today. The contract expired at midnight Feb. 29. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said there would be no picketing in the East today. `` The longer the strike goes on, the more reruns the public will see,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> executive director and chief negotiator. `` It's a very tight ratings race and unfortunately for the networks it will impact them.'' Picket captain <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said selection of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> studio `` was fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and location had a lot to do with it. `` We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking around here,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'' writer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hixon </PERSON>, who marched with his 2-year old son, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, said writers were much more unified for this strike than in their last walkout in 1985. `` There was nearly a civil war last time between screen writers and television writers. But this time there's real solidarity,'' <PERSON> Hixon </PERSON> said. `` Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs relying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and the soaps will see a difference right away,'' said guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The strike slows down the production process and if prolonged, `` it finally comes to a halt,'' she said. A three-month strike delayed the fall television season three years ago. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said the network that would be hardest hit would be first-place <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, whose `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>,'' `` Saturday Night Live'' and `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' would be affected immediately. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, said nine soap operas on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and five in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also would be affected immediately, as would prime time miniseries, television movies and features in development or in production. But <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the alliance, which represents 200 producers and studios, said a strike was anticipated and scripts have been stockpiled. `` Shows like <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s show will go into reruns. But we will continue business,'' he said. Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some one-hour shows syndicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said they could n't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets. The median annual income for writers is $ 40,000 a year, but about half of the guild's members are unemployed at any given time, said <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The writers sought the first change in 17 years in how they are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets. They now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is negotiated between the writer and producer. The writers also demanded more artistic control on the final product. `` We had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short of giving them total control,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` The director is the captain of that creative team. We could n't bargain away rights that belonged to other guilds and unions.'' The producers had offered a $ 50 million package over a three-year period, including improvements in pension and health plans, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. In union ballots last week in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 96 percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached. The last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks. Since the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> won its first contract in 1947, script writers conducted strikes five times, more than any other entertainment industry union. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> bargained through the weekend with makers of TV and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerun payments for 100,000 actors. Members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent margin in recent votes, said <ORGANIZATION> SAG </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against most major currencies in European trading Monday. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said the British pound gained almost 4 cents against the dollar _ a remarkable one-day advance _ and also rose against every other currency. Reports in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that British interest rates would stay high and that the economy was growing at a strong pace were credited for the pound's strength. Sterling's rise quickened when it became clear the state-run Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was not selling pounds to prevent sterling from rising against the West German mark. A higher exchange rate means British goods become more expensive abroad. The bank's refusal to act was in line with government policy to encourage companies to be more competitive by becoming more efficient. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8135 late Monday, up from $ 1.7740 late Friday. Other late rates for the dollar late Monday, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6940; 1.3870 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030; 5.6880 French francs, down from 5.7300; 1.8840 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010; 1.239.75 Italian lire, down from 1,248.00; and 1.2562 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2547. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier, the dollar closed at 128.87 Japanese yen, down from 129.22 late Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Monday, the dollar traded at 128.30 Gold prices were mixed. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major trading center, gold closed at a late bid price of $ 437.20 a troy ounce, down from $ 437.50 late Friday. The late bid price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 436, up from $ 432 late Friday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 438.75, up from $ 438.21. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 6.42 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.41.

 The federal government and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bought annuities for $ 7,735,000 to settle the claims by survivors of four of the astronauts who died aboard the space shuttle Challenger, according to documents released today. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, the company that produced the faulty booster rocket blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion, paid 60 percent of the total cost of buying the annuities, or $ 4,641,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged. The government's share, 40 percent, cost $ 3,094,000. The families will actually receive more than $ 7.7 million because the annuities pay out over a period of many years. The total they will receive and the breakdown by family were not released. The documents, along with several <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statements describing how the settlements were reached, were released to settle a civil suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and six other news organizations. The government had originally kept all details of the settlements and how they were reached secret. The settlements were reached by the government and the company with the immediate survivors of spacecraft commander <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, 46, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer employed by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>; mission specialist <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, 39, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel; payload specialist <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, 41, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, 37, a <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, high school teacher. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> was survived by his wife, June, and two adult children; <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, by his wife, <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON>, and two minor children; <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, by his wife, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON>, and <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, by her husband, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, and two minor children. The government said in court documents filed during the suit that it began negotiations with these four and an informa representative on June 18, 1986. The settlements were announced Dec. 29, 1986. The government's document make clear that the survivors of the four had no legal representation during the negotiations, but received informal assistance from <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the executor of <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s estate and her husband's law partner. <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> said in an affidavit that the families never spoke directly to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials. The families dealt only with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, who negotiated with them on behalf of the contractor. A presidential commission blamed the explosion on a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a solid-fuel booster rocket built by <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> and ignited the main fuel tank. The fireball consumed the Challenger 73 seconds after launch from the Kennedy Space Center in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The astronauts are believed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to have died before the debris hit the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Survivors of two other Challenger astronauts and <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>' father have reached settlements with <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> to which the government did not contribute. Last month, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, the divorced father of mission specialist <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, 36, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employee, settled with the company for an amount he said was `` commensurate with what some of the others got _ from $ 2 million to $ 3.5 million.'' In January, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> <PERSON> Belfer </PERSON>, divorced mother of the astronaut, and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, father of the Hughes employee, settled with the company. The amounts were not disclosed. Last May, the company settled a suit by <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, wife of mission specialist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, 35, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employee who also left two infant children. The amount was not disclosed. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, wife of pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 40, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, has a suit pending in federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> against the company. The government last month succeeded in having itself dismissed as a defendant in that suit on the basis of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that survivors of active duty military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful death. A separate settlement agreement between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> covered only the claims by the survivors of the four astronauts. That agreement in no way `` abrogates any claim of any nature which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have against <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> for property damage associated with the Challenger accident, including but not limited to any claims for the loss of the Orbiter itself,'' the document said. The replacement orbiter now under construction is expected to cost $ 3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said today that negotiations are continuing between <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and company lawyers on the type and amount of penalties that will be imposed on the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> rocket-maker's contract with the government A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> statement in February 1987 said that <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> would forfeit $ 10 million in profit and would receive no profit from $ 409 million worth of redesign work. But <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said that does not represent the end of the matter. `` Our lawyers are playing with it; it's in the hands of the general counsel,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A significant number of American companies will bolster hiring this spring, a leading temporary job service said Monday in an unusually optimistic quarterly forecast on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment. <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its Employment Outlook Survey indicated 29 percent of respondents plan to raise employment rolls in the April-June quarter, while 6 percent expect declines. Sixty-two percent plan no change and 3 percent do n't know, the survey stated. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON>, Manpower president, said it was the strongest spring hiring forecast in four years and suggested manufacturers in all regions of the country are unusually buoyant about the economy. Makers of large durable goods are among the most optimistic of all employers, with 32 percent planning payroll increases and 7 percent planning cutbacks, the survey showed. Among construction companies, 36 percent anticipate payroll increases and 7 percent anticipate cutbacks. Among retailers, 31 percent plan increased payrolls and 6 percent plan decreases. Even in the financial services industry, which was particularly affected by the October collapse in stock prices, the spring hiring forecast was still optimistic. Twenty-three percent of respondents plan to add employees and 7 percent will cut back. Manpower has issued the quarterly survey for the past 12 years and calls it as a significant indicator of employment trends. Conducted in last two weeks of February, the survey was based on telephone interviews with more than 13,000 public and private employers in 401 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. The margin of error is 5 percent, the company said. Based in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, Manpower describes itself as the world's largest temporary service firm, annually providing jobs to more than 700,000 people through 1,350 offices in 33 countries

<TEXT>
 Consumers have regained virtually all the confidence they lost as a result of the October stock market crash, but there are indications employers could be cutting back their hiring plans, according to two surveys released Monday. The Conference Board, in issuing its monthly Consumer Confidence Index, said consumers have been heartened by continuing strength in the economy. However, the business research organization said consumers also may be feeling more optimistic because their paychecks are larger because of tax cuts that took effect Jan. 1. The Consumer Confidence Index was 113.9 points in February, up from January's 109.9 points and 100.8 in November, after the crash. The index, which uses a 1985 base of 100, stood at 115.1 in October, before the Oct. 19 stock collapse. The Conference Board's Help Wanted Index painted a somewhat less optimistic picture. The index, which reflects the amount of help wanted ads in 51 major newspapers across the nation, declined to 153 in January from 155 in December. The index, which uses a 1967 base of 100, reflects changes in demand for labor and general business conditions. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economist, said the drop in the index signaled a slowdown in hiring plans by employers. `` Recent dips in want ad volume suggest that companies are taking a hard look at their expansion plans,'' he said. Help wanted advertising volume fell in six of nine regions of the country: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and East South Central.

<HEAD>Livestock Futures Soar As Market Looks Forward To Greater Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Livestock and meat futures prices rose sharply Monday as traders looked beyond the cash market's current problems and saw meat sales improving in the months ahead. On other markets, energy futures slid lower; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; precious metals retreated; and stock-index futures advanced. Slack retail demand for meat during Lent led to a slowdown in slaughters last week, prompting fears of a growing supply of slaughter-ready cattle and hogs. Analysts said those fears, along with the closing of at least one major beef packing plant, were largely responsible for losses on livestock futures last week at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But indications of a cattle buildup did not surface Monday, leading many traders to rethink their positions and look ahead to a resurgence in demand after Easter, analysts said. `` Prices went down last week on ideas we were backing up cattle -LRB- but -RRB- we have n't seen any proof of that yet,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson-McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said traders had turned their attention to the future and away from the industry's current woes. `` They're thinking that retail demand will pick up, packers will have to accumulate supplies and the cattle feeders will reap the profits by being able to sell cattle at higher prices,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said some traders also bought livestock futures on ideas that prices for future delivery of cattle and hogs had fallen more sharply than conditions warranted. And some were betting that a winter storm moving into the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> would disrupt the movement of animals to market, resulting in temporarily tight supplies and higher prices, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. The bullish enthusiasm for cattle futures overflowed into the pork pits, analysts said. Live cattle settled .87 cent to 1.38 cents higher with the contract for delivery in April at 71.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 cent to 1.10 cents higher with March at 80.35 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to 1.25 cents higher with April at 43.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.20 cents to 1.85 cents higher with March at 54.70 cents a pound. Energy futures prices retreated in moderate trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following a slight advance in the previous session. Analysts attributed the decline to speculation that some member nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were selling oil at a discount. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 22 cents lower with April at $ 15.37 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent to .25 cent lower with April at 43.41 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .34 cent to .57 cent lower with April at 43.94 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, although soybean futures were mixed. Expectations of new export business supported the markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced after the close that it had sold 1.6 million bushels of wheat Friday in the last of last week's three auctions for surplus, government-owned wheat The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had targeted 10 million bushels for sale at that auction. The agency also announced it would hold three auctions a week, each with a 10-million-bushel target, through March 25. Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with March at $ 3.04 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.00 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 4 cents higher with March at $ 1.90 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 \ cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 6.13 -RCB- a bushel Gold and silver futures retreated slightly on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But despite its weak tone, the market appeared to have shaken off the recessionary expectactions that had weighed on prices in recent weeks, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower with April at $ 438.60 a troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 3.5 cents lower with March at $ 6.395 a troy ounce Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.10 points higher at 268.30. The underlying spot index closed nearly unchanged at 267.38.

 A federal judge said Monday he will order a new election in the contested race for director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union's eight-state <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> region, ending part of a 21-month legal battle. `` It's a victory for the people in Region 5 who've had to operate without a legally elected director for 21 months,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who lost by two-tenths of a vote to incumbent Region 5 director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON> in the August 1986 election. Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhrheinrich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments from attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, assistant director of Region 5 who was fired after he announced plans to run against his boss in May 1986. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> is the leader of a dissident group within the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which has called for less cooperation with companies that are forcing workers to compete with each other for jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigated the contest and called for new elections after it found some votes at the convention were cast by illegal delegates. It also found that <PERSON> Worley </PERSON> spent $ 13,000 in union money on jackets bearing his name, which were distributed at the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> constitutional convention where the delegates voted, and sent out campaign fliers typed with a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> typewriter on <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> stationery in a UAW office. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Graney </PERSON>, who argued three lawsuits the department brought against the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> concerning the election, said such uses of union money and equipment for the campaign of an individual are illegal. `` I'm going to order a new election. There have been substantial uses of union facilities'' for <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>'s campaign, <PERSON> Suhrheinrich </PERSON> said, adding that he would issue a formal order in two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> declined comment until it receives the order. The union has said it is willing only to run some of the delegate elections over. In a new election, 68 local unions in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will again choose 650 delegates who will vote for the director of Region 5 at a mini-convention. The elections will not affect terms of local union officials. <PERSON> Suhrheinrich </PERSON> did not say how he would rule on one of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suits, which charges <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was illegally fired, or on a suit brought by <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> demanding reinstatement and payment of lost wages and benefits. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yablonski </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued that <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was fired illegally because the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> constitution allows international union staff members to run for union office. They also argued that the rule used to fire Tucker, which requires staff members running for office to take a leave of absence 90 days before the election, was never properly adopted by the union's leadership or by the rank-and-file.

<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodison </PERSON> said Monday he is resigning at the end of the year as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which he piloted through its `` Big Bang'' computer revolution in 1986 and the market crash last October. <PERSON> Goodison </PERSON>, 53, will take over the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Trustee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> next Jan. 1. `` I have served on the <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> for the past 20 years and been chairman for the past 12. I have been chairman during a period of great innovation and change and now feel that the structure for the future has been built,'' <PERSON> Goodison </PERSON> said in a statement. An election among the stock exchange's members for a new chairman is likely in the fall. <PERSON> Goodison </PERSON> in his new post succeeds Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>, who will be 70 on March 29 and due for retirement this year from leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Trustee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is a financial services group as well as a bank with 1.9 million investors. <PERSON> Goodison </PERSON> has been chairman of stockbrokers <ORGANIZATION> Quilter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> since 1975 He said the stock crash of last October and November had nothing to do with his move, and that the old-style exchange could not have absorbed the wave of selling. When he became chairman, <PERSON> Goodison </PERSON> was confronted with the then <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government's decision to reconstruct the stock exchange by separating market-makers and brokers into different partnerships. Eleven years later came the Big Bang, on Oct. 27, 1986, ending fixed commissions and the distinction between brokers who were agents in the buying and selling of shares and stock-jobbers who actively traded in shares at prices they quoted to brokers.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices fell modestly Monday in light trading as the dollar drifted lower and a key commodity-price index edged higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond fell -RRB- point, or $ 3.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 8.51 percent from 8.47 percent late Friday. The bellwether issue had plunged $ 20 per $ 1,000 in face amount on Friday, after the government reported unexpectedly high February employment levels, raising doubts about forecasts of an economic slowdown later this year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the report prompted some investment firms to raise their economic growth forecasts. Faster growth is generally viewed negatively in the bond market because credit demands increase when the economy expands, pushing interest rates up. <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Won </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said the bond market was also hurt by a new decline in the dollar and a slight rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> index, mainly due to higher meat prices. A falling dollar reduces the yields available to foreign investors on dollar-denominated investments. It also raises pressure on domestic producers to keep prices low to compete with foreign products. Meanwhile, interest rates rose from last week on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities sold in the government's latest auction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.74 percent, up from 5.62 percent last week. Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.93 percent, up from 5.86 percent last week. The rates for three-month bills were the highest since Feb. 1 when they sold for 5.74 percent. Three-month bills sold for 5.85 percent on Jan. 25. The rates for six-month bills were the highest since Feb. 16 when they averaged 6.03 percent. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, held steady at 6.63 percent last week, the same as the rate for the previous week. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues slipped 2-32 point, intermediate maturities were down \ point and 20-year issues fell -LRB- point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.17 to 112.97. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, lost 2.29 to 1,181.09. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities fell \ point in light trading, according to the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was off 0.64 to 283.78 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose 2 basis points to 5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills were unchanged at 5.95 percent and one-year bills rose 3 basis points to 6.30 percent.

<HEAD>American Standard To Consider Sweetened Black &amp; Decker Buyout
Offer</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its board of directors would consider the latest hostile buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and indicated it might sweeten its own alternative plan a second time. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, which has been pursuing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> since late January, last Friday sweetened its outstanding tender offer to $ 73 a share from $ 68 for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s 31 million common shares outstanding, or a total of about $ 2.26 billion. That move came after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, a plumbing and air conditioning maker, sweetened its defensive recapitalization plan to $ 2.3 billion. The revised recapitalization announced Friday would pay shareholders $ 64 in cash, $ 5 in securities and one share of stock in the recapitalized company for each old share. The earlier cash portion was $ 59 a share. American Standard rose 75 cents to $ 73.25 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> dipped 37 -LCB- cents to $ 18 a share, a decline stemming partly from an adjustment for a dividend payment. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said the company's recapitalization plan already was financially superior to <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s sweetened tender offer and advised shareholders not to tender their stock. `` In the meantime, stockholders should be aware that, if <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Decker increases its offer beyond the values we can achieve for our stockholders in a recapitalization, we would vigorously pursue other alternatives in order to enhance stockholder value,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> stated. He also said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> was `` working on ways to further improve'' its recapitalization plan, but did not elaborate. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, Md.-based maker of tools and appliances, also has indicated it would attempt to win shareholder support for taking control of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors.

 Loss-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar-Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed two years ago by a merger but has seen its aggressive expansion plans disintegrate, said Monday it is discussing the possibility of being acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Word of the negotiations helped push <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price up $ 2.50 a share to $ 15 In the past year, the stock has traded as high as $ 25.25 and as low as $ 6.62 -LCB-. `` I'd say the odds -LRB- of a takeover -RRB- are 50-50,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, an entertainment industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He estimated the final price of a deal would be `` somewhere between $ 14 and the high teens.'' <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> has about 45.9 million shares outstanding. In a brief statement, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, a leading supplier of original television programming, said it was approached by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and preliminary talks were under way `` to explore the desirability of a business combination.'' However, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> said its board has made no decision as to whether such a deal would be in the best interests of shareholders. The company also noted it has been approached about possible mergers in the past and nothing came of those overtures. The Culver City-based company was formed in February 1986 by the stock-swap combination of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, best known as the producer of such long-running television series as `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Knots Landing,'' and New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which got most of its revenue from animated shows such as `` Thundercats'' and such programs as `` Peoples Court'' and `` Love Connection.'' For the 1987-88 television season, the company is producing 12 hours of prime time and 16 -LCB- hours of syndicated shows, including `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' `` Mama's Family,'' `` It's a Living'' and `` She's the Sheriff.'' For the first nine months of of its current fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> posted a loss of $ 82.6 million on revenues of $ 616.8 million. The deficit included $ 45 million in writedowns on five movies and $ 22 million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video unit. Management of both its movie and home-video units was recently ousted. For fiscal 1987 ended last March 31, the company lost $ 58.6 million, mostly because of restructuring costs, on revenues of $ 766.2 million. In recent years, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> sought to expand far beyond its successful roots as a producer of television shows. It bought advertising agencies, sought to build a network of television stations and acquired a children's publishing unit, but it has shed most of those operations in a back-to-basics restructuring announced last June. The company has just completed the sale of the ad agencies _ <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Eckhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Poppe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ to members of their management for about $ 100 million, posting a pre-tax profit of $ 16 million. In late 1986, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> had agreed to buy seven big-city <PERSON> Storer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wometco </ORGANIZATION> television stations from <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> for $ 1.85 billion. The move would have given <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> 12 stations around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. However, the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> collapsed as the bottom fell out of the market for television stations, and the company has sold some of the stations it already owned and is seeking buyers for the remainder. The company also sold its children's publishing unit. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> studio, is a leading record producer and is a major cable television operator. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s financial results have been strong. In 1987, its profit rose 77 percent to $ 328.1 million, or $ 2.09 a share, from $ 185.8 million, of $ 1.26 a share, the previous year. The 1987 figures included a net gain of $ 37.3 million on the sale of investments while the 1986 results included a gain of $ 48.4 million from the sale of investments and a gain from discontinued operations. Revenue for 1987 rose 20 percent to $ 3.4 billion from $ 2.84 billion. Its <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> film unit had the best year in its history, with an operating profit of $ 176.4 million, compared to $ 172.2 million in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s music operation posted a 1987 operating profit of $ 213.9 million, up from $ 150.6 million, and operating profit from the cable and broadcasting division jumped to $ 46.1 million for the year from $ 16.2 million in 1986.

<HEAD>A.H. Robins Reports Net Loss Despite Record Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although sales for the <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 11 percent for the final three months of 1987, the pharmaceutical company reported a net loss of $ 1.69 billion for the period because of costs related to its Dalkon Shield birth-control device. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> said its loss in the period compared to a profit of $ 26.2 million, or $ 1.08 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 234.8 million from $ 210.8 million a year earlier. For all of 1987, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> suffered a loss of $ 1.63 billion compared to a profit of $ 81.8 million, or $ 3.38 a share, in 1986. Revenue for the year rose to $ 855.8 million from $ 789.9 million. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> was forced to set aside $ 1.75 billion last year to help cover the costs of claims concerning women who were injured by the Dalkon Shield, which has been discontinued. The accrual represents the difference between the $ 2.30 billion provided in the company's fifth amended reorganization plan and the $ 548 million which remained from the reserve for <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claims established by the company in 1984. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' results were also hurt by the costs of its Chapter 11 reorganization in federal bankruptcy court. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the president and chief executive, said consumer products in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, international operations and medical instruments were the principal contributors to the higher sales for the year.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Ask Airline To Agree To Arbitration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Teamsters union asked <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to submit issues separating the company and its 6,500 flight attendants to binding arbitration. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it would not agree to arbitration but was willing to resume talks. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> airline division, said flight attendants were prepared to strike if the airline did not agree to arbitration in 72 hours. Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s administration backed the arbitration request, said state <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who joined Genoese in a news conference at a Teamsters office in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The flight attendants, more than 2,000 of them based in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, have worked since a Feb. 26 strike deadline, but no talks have been held for the past week. Genoese cited economic and safety concerns as reasons for holding off on a strike this long. He referred to a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> report Friday on safety concerns at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and said a strike would mean operating with less experienced replacement flight attendants. `` This would threaten both the comfort and safety of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> passengers,'' he said. Issues dividing the two sides include a two-tier wage system under which attendants hired after May 1984 must work five years to earn the same as those hired earlier. The airline proposes to extend the time to nine years. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, `` without commenting on the merits of either side,'' said the <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> administration is concerned about the Detroit-based flight attendants' jobs and the potential economic impact of a strike. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> accounts for about half the air traffic in and out of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport, the largest of its three hubs. The airline operates about 248 flights a day at <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>, about 227 at <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, where it is headquartered, and 201 at its <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, hub.

 The federal government and rocket maker <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 7,735,000 in cash and annuities and divided the cost 40-60 to settle all claims by the families of four of the astronauts who died in the Challenger explosion. Documents released Monday showed that <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, which produced the faulty booster rocket blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion, paid $ 4,641,000. The government's share of the settlements was $ 3,094,000. A lawyer who represented other family members called the settlements `` woefully inadequate.'' The surviving four spouses and six children actually will receive more than $ 7.7 million. This is because each was given an annuity, which pays benefits larger than its cost but over a period of many years. The total dollar amount the families will receive over time and the breakdown by family were not released. With the release of the documents, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> settled a civil suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and six other news organizations. The government originally had kept details of the settlements and negotiations secret, saying it needed to keep its internal deliberations confidential and that the company and families demanded secrecy. The documents, with some deletions to preserve family privacy, included the final settlement agreements with the families and the company, some correspondence between the government and the company, and several <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statements concerning the negotiations. The settlements were reached Dec. 29, 1986, with the immediate survivors of spacecraft commander <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, 46, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer employed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>; mission specialist <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, 39, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel; payload specialist <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, 41, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, 37, a <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, public high school teacher. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> is survived by his wife, June, and two adult children; <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON> left his wife, <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON>, and two minor children; <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> left his wife, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON>; and <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> left her husband, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, and two minor children. Among the disclosures: _ The four families had no lawyers during the negotiations They relied instead on informal advice from <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the law partner of <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s husband and executor of her estate. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did all the negotiating for <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> as well as the government <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> said in an affidavit that the families never spoke to company officials. _ The rocket maker and its insurers twice tried to have the settlements cover any property damage <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> might have caused, such as destruction of the orbiter and payload The government refused, and those claims are still in negotiation. _ Although the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claims it can not legally be sued by the families of military or federal civilian employees who die on duty, it contributed 40 percent to each of the settlements Only the <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> and <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> relatives had a right to sue the government; all the astronaut families could sue the company. _ Even <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>'s attorneys said the government was being unfair to the divorced parents of mission specialist <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, 36, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employee `` My negotiations on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> have been constrained by the government's refusal to participate to any degree at all'' in a settlement the company considered acceptable, company attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> wrote Justice last July. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s ex-husband, represented her father, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, and last month reached a settlement with the company to which the government did not contribute. Asked about the document release, <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> said Monday, `` It confirmed our suspicion that the government had made a contribution to people in <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s situation, that is, government employees, and that we were being treated unfairly.'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> said that settlement was `` commensurate with what some of the others got _ from $ 2 million to $ 3.5 million.'' In January, <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> <PERSON> Belfer </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, settled with <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> but the government did not contribute Last May, the company settled a suit by <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, wife of mission specialist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, 35, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employee who also left two infant children. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Krist </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lawyer who represented <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Belfer </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> McNairs </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not have allowed his clients to accept such a `` woefully inadequate'' settlement as the four did. `` They would have netted more money if they had been adequately represented,'' <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> said, even taking attorneys fees into account. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON>, whose husband <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> was killed in the Apollo One fire on the launch pad in 1967, said she was treated unjustly when it came to settlement of her claim against <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>. `` It kind of hurts ... It hurts when I think that they're getting that much money,'' she said. She and her two children received $ 350,000. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, wife of pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 40, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, has a suit pending in federal court against the company. The government last month was dismissed as a defendant, because military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful death. A presidential commission said the explosion occurred when hot gas leaked through a joint in a booster rocket built by <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> and ignited the main fuel tank. A separate agreement between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> asserted that disposal of the four claims in no way `` abrogates any claim of any nature which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have against <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> for property damage associated with the Challenger accident, including but not limited to any claims for the loss of the orbiter itself,'' the document said. The replacement orbiter now under construction is expected to cost $ 3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said Monday that negotiations are continuing between <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> lawyers on the type and amount of penalties that will be imposed on the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> rocket-maker's contract with the government A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> statement in February 1987 said <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> would forfeit $ 10 million in profit and receive no profit from $ 409 million worth of redesign work. But <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said that does not end the matter.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement Ends Threat of Strike at Key Stamping Plant</HEAD>

 A tentative settlement reached early Monday between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, derailing the threat of a strike at a key Sterling Heights stamping plant. `` Obviously, the company is hopeful that the workers will ratify the agreement and that the threat of a strike will disappear,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said. Sterling Heights makes metal hoods and trunk lids for all domestically made <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars and most trucks and makes fuel tanks for all <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars except one. A strike there would soon have hurt all <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> production, and additional strikes at a few other key plants could have crippled <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> within days. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> had joined negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1264 on Friday, a day after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced it would not sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. The union would have been the first to receive <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>'s permission to strike over local issues such as health-and-safety grievances and violation of work rules <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> had promised to give immediate strike authorization to all locals with legitimate grievances. But after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> decided to keep its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, he began moving to resolve local disputes. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> and other negotiators bargained through the weekend and reached a tentative settlement on Local 1264's grievances at 5 a.m. Monday, the union said. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> was unavailable for comment Monday. The union said it was withholding details of the agreement until March 11, when the local's 3,600 active and 500 laid-off members will vote on the settlement. `` We saved a lot of jobs and got additional jobs,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, Local 1264 recording secretary and a member of the local's bargaining committee <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreed to add workers to clean up oil that leaks from the plants massive presses onto the shop floor and to clean and repair the machines as a matter of routine. Workers had complained that because the presses are run around the clock, they do n't receive adequate maintenance, particularly cleaning, and the machines and the floors around them are covered with oil and dirt. Local 1264 had accumulated nearly 140 unresolved grievances since last year. Other locals had been gathering grievances so they could be ready to strike if <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had decided to sell <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rejected as inadequate an unsolicited $ 1.88 billion buyout offer from the partnership led by <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> on Monday and said it wished to remain independent. The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest gold producer, unanimously rejected the $ 20 a share buyout offer made last month by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 17.12 -LCB- a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unchanged from Friday's close. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> had labeled the buyout offer a friendly bid and proposed a negotiated transaction with <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>'s managers. But <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>'s board concluded the offer was inadequate and not in the best interests of the stockholders, said company officials. `` In light of our business prospects, we are better off served as an independent company, said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of financial services `` We are trying to focus on the financial future of the company.'' `` We're really in a strong position right now with significant cash assets and a very strong balance sheet, and our management is in a better position to put that money to work for the company,'' <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON> stated. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest gold producers in the western world outside of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, owns the <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> gold mine in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> mine in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The company also has a one-quarter interest in the <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> owns a 42.5 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer of lead products, and a 48 percent interest in two mines in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> had not made a tender offer to <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, and she was unsure whether he would now pursue a hostile takeover in light of the board's rejection. The offer was <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' second move on a gold-mining company in six months. His $ 2 billion takeover attempt for New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was blocked when <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, acquired a controlling stake in the company to help thwart the hostile bid.

 Striking scriptwriters warned that their walkout would send TV soap operas, talk shows and variety programs into reruns, but producers said Monday they have stockpiled enough scripts to ride out a long strike. Movie and television scriptwriters left their typewriters and joined nearly 2,000 colleagues on a picket line at 20th Century Fox studios in a contract dispute over the issues of residuals and creative control. Carrying placards reading `` The Writers Guild Strikes,'' pickets five-abreast snaked in front of the Fox studios in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Hollywood has treated writers like bean-field workers for years,'' said screenwriter and science fiction author <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>. `` It begins with the dream. Without the dream on paper, there is nothing.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> rejected Sunday's final offer by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> and a strike was ordered for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. Six hundred news writers were exempt. `` We feel all the issues were dealt with fairly. They went on strike on issues we felt were resolved,'' alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said, adding producers were `` ready to write a check for $ 550 million'' for a new three-year contract. The alliance represents about 200 producers and studios. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a meeting for both sides Tuesday. Issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage of foreign market distribution residuals, and an offer by producers to scale back syndication residuals for one-hour television shows. Producers claim new shows made for independent stations have dried up the rerun syndication market. Their offer includes an increase to 150 percent of current residual agreements if the show does well in syndication. Writers claim the offer is not equitable with a similar deal given the Directors Guild last summer. Actress <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, also showed up on the picket line to show solidarity with the writers, but the actors contract prohibits secondary walkouts. The union said talk shows, game shows and soap operas would quickly reflect the strike's impact, but producers said scripts had been stockpiled and that many prime-time shows had completed shooting for the season. `` Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs relying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and the soaps will see a difference right away,'' guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. A three-month strike delayed the fall television season in 1981. `` It's business as usual. We're prepared,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON> said. The network produces the soaps `` Guiding Light,'' `` As the World Turns,'' `` The Bold And The Beautiful'' and `` The Young And The Restless.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Giofre </PERSON> said the network's `` Another World,'' `` Days Of Our Lives'' and `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>,'' would n't be affected soon because there were scripts already written for another month. The strike wo n't immediately effect <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' and `` Saturday Night Live,'' which were already on scheduled breaks. `` The Tonight Show With <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'' featured guest host <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> on Monday, as scheduled. But the comedian used material prepared before the strike, <PERSON> Giofre </PERSON> said. On daily production shows such as soap operas, writers normally turn out scripts near shooting schedule deadlines. Shows like `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' are known for ad-lib lines, but much of the monologue and skits are created by a writing staff. Since much of the material is topical, it often is written within minutes of showtime. Picket captain <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said selection of <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> `` was fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and location had a lot to do with it. `` We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking around here.'' The guild's contract expired at midnight Feb. 29. Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some one-hour shows syndicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said they could n't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> claimed foreign residual payments have increased 84.6 percent since 1972, which was the last time writers negotiated that issue. Writers receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is negotiated between the writer and producer. `` When the business is good, they are going to share it,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` But while we're making money in foreign, we're still losing money in domestic, and that foreign distribution money has to cover those losses. The median annual income for writers is $ 40,000 a year, but about half of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s members are unemployed at any given time, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said.
