<TEXT>
 Two hostage passengers on a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet pleaded for their lives via radio Friday and urged the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government to give in to the demands of the Shiite Moslem gunmen. Algerian mediators shuttled between the booby-trapped jet and <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials on Friday, the 11th day of the crisis. The masked gunmen who commandeered the jumbo jet on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on April 5 want <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to release 17 terrorists convicted of bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1982. `` In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and my friends and I ask the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> authorities to free the 17 prisoners held in <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> prisons,'' said <PERSON> Soleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Soleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Mashari </PERSON>, one hostage, in a message to the control tower. `` In the event of refusal, they are going to kill us.'' In a second message, a man identifying himself as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ajem </PERSON> said: `` I am one of the hostages from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. I greet my family, large and small and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the prisoners in the prisons. Without that, the kidnappers have decided to kill us.'' An estimated 31 passengers and four crew members were being held in grim conditions by eight hijackers, armed with guns and grenades. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official speaking on condition of anonymity said a man wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was believed to be one of the gunmen on the Kuwaiti plane. The official said the man, <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Izz-Al-Din </PERSON>, was named in a 1987 federal indictment charging him and three others with conspiracy to commit air piracy, murder and assault in the hijacking in which 39 Americans were held hostage and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailor was killed. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which had 112 passengers aboard when it began its journey, was diverted to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Fifty-seven passengers were released in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and another 13 in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Two passengers were killed in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The air pirates have threatened to kill the remaining hostages and blow up the plane if their demands are not met. Algerian officials expressed disappointment Friday that negotiations at the airport had not achieved better results. Negotiations began Wednesday, shortly after the plane arrived from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Western sources in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said it was believed that parallel, high-level negotiations were also taking place between <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> acting as an intermediary. A report by the official <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> news agency Friday said the hijackers appeared to be divided over the negotiations, and it seemed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was directing the hard-line faction. Some of the hijackers believed to have boarded in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> had in recent hours become `` more extremist and obstinate,'' said the agency KUNA, without citing any sources. State-owned <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> radio reported that <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> on Friday telephoned Algerian Premier <PERSON> Abdelhamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahimi </PERSON> to discuss `` the intensification of efforts being exerted to bring about the release of the passengers.'' The radio report, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gave no details. On Thursday, the hijackers released <PERSON> Djuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON>, 70, a diabetic who was in urgent need of an insulin injection. Before his release, he had been examined on board the plane by an Algerian doctor who told the hijackers <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> was in danger of dying if he did not receive treatment. After <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> was freed, the gunmen issued a statement saying, `` We are not highway bandits.'' However, the hijackers repeated their demand and said they would carry out executions `` even if the price we have to pay is very high.'' A <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> official, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> reported that all of the hostages had their wrists handcuffed behind their backs. They were not allowed to speak or move from their seats in the mid-section of the plane except to be escorted to the toilets by one of the gunmen, who kept a pistol pointed at the hostage's back. <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> said the hostages were completely ignorant of the negotiations. He said there were eight hijackers and that passengers were grouped in seat rows 22 to 36, located directly above the fuel tanks. A <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation that four bombs were attached to the four doors in the midsection of the plane. Among the hostages are three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family and at least four crew members. Algerian officials on Thursday privately expressed optimism that their separate negotiations with the Shiite Moslem hijackers and a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation would lead to the release of the last two women on board, cousins of the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. There was widespread disappointment when only <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> was freed. <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> said the hostage treated most roughly was the <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, 33, cousin of the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, regarded as the hijackers' trump card. <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> suffered from a severe nervous disorder even before he boarded the plane in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, and the experience of the hijack `` seems to have put him over the brink,'' <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> said <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> had continuous violent shakes, was unable to speak and cries continuously. The hijackers brought a microphone to him and tried to force him to make a statement, but he was unable to do so.

<TEXT>
 The alleged mastermind behind the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 422 is a longtime fugitive from justice linked to two earlier hijacks. <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>, 36, is one of four suspects wanted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner on June 14, 1985, by Shiite Moslem extremists. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days before being freed after Syrian intervention. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official said another man wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking was believed to be a hijacker on the Kuwaiti plane. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the man, <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Izz-Al-Din </PERSON>, was named in a 1987 federal indictment charging him and three others with conspiracy to commit air piracy, murder and assault in the hijacking. Western intelligence agencies also believe <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> was involved in the December 1984 hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that left two Americans dead. Iranian security forces stormed the plane after five days. The hijackers disappeared and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has issued no word about them. Western sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> is the leader of a clan, one of several in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that control the drug trade in there. He also is chief of security for the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is considered by Western and Lebanese intelligence agencies to be the umbrella organization for groups holding foreigners hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>'s cousin and brother-in-law is one of the three Shiites among the 17 imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> who have been sentenced to death. Western observers have said it is this family connection that has fueled <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>'s mission to free the 17 terrorists. The Kuwaitis have identified the condemned man as <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON>, but his real name is <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Badreddin </PERSON>. He entered <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on a forged Iraqi passport, Western intelligence authorities said. Ever since <PERSON> Badreddin </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> has tried to free him. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> dropped out of sight in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> several weeks ago, according to well-informed sources who asked not to be identified. One of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s factions is the Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group holding foreigners hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It has said it would free the Americans they hold if <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> frees the 17 terrorists. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused and the hijacking of the Kuwaiti airliner, which was taken first to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and finally to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, has not changed that stance. At one point during talks in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators said the hijackers offered to release half their hostages if <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> freed the three among the 17 who had been sentenced to death. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>'s cousin is among the three. The Cypriots, acting on Kuwaiti advice, rejected the offer. But it underlined <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>'s suspected role in the hijacking. Western intelligence sources believe that <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> joined the hijacked Kuwaiti airliner in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, when it landed there after it was seized during a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sent a formal protest to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Friday alleging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> violations of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s sovereignty during a firefight involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines this week. The protest said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops closed a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> highway just outside the capital for three hours Tuesday night after fighting broke out between `` soldiers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and an unknown group.'' At a news conference called by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, Marine 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said Friday that his company became engaged in a gunfight Tuesday night at a fuel depot with uniformed men `` who were using us as training aids.'' `` They were highly professional,'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON>, who has served for 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, told the news conference at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command's headquarters. `` They were good. They were trying to provoke us.'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said the intruders wore black uniforms and carried sophisticated night - vision equipment, but declined to speculate on whether they were members of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> In the protest sent to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON> called the highway closing a `` flagrant violation of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s sovereignty'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. According to earlier reports, the highway was closed after about 100 Marines exchanged fire with what they described as 40 to 50 uniformed intruders at the fuel dump near <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, a few miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said it consulted with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> before closing the highway for `` security reasons.'' Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> was presented at the news conference Friday to answer reporters' questions because of skeptical reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and ridicule in the Panamanian press, which is largely controlled by the government. <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> told of two separate firefights Tuesday night, and said that during one eight Marines and a sailor were surrounded by a group of intruders about half a mile from the sergeant's position. No casualties were reported Tuesday, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> was shot and fatally wounded by fellow Marines in an incident Monday. <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> said the fatal shooting occurred as the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> tried to encircle eight intruders wearing black uniforms and moving in military fashion. The Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under federal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who dominates the civilian government, to resign. <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said a full investigation into the actions Monday and Tuesday was under way. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains about 10,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a permanent force to defend the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. About 1,300 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and Marines were sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week to increase security. The Panamanian government has described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines as inexperienced troops who were `` shooting at swaying palm trees.'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON>'s account of Tuesday's incidents left unanswered the questions of who were the intruders and why in more than two hours of sporadic gunfire were there apparently no injuries on either side. He was asked to assess the intruders' motives and the sergeant replied: `` They were basically using us as training aides, to see how they can get around and how they ca n't get around, to see how they can get detected and how they ca n't get detected.'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> raised a new question when he said <PERSON> Marines </PERSON> did not chase the intruders into the surrounding jungle because a month or so earlier `` two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> MPs chased an intruder into the jungle and one was hacked to death with a machete and the other was cut up pretty bad.'' No such incident had been announced and after the news conference military spokesmen said <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> had repeated a rumor that had no basis in fact. And while <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> said he had a group of about 42 intruders almost constantly in view with a night-vision device, `` I did n't see a weapon on them I ca n't say why. We could see them clearly.'' He said of the shooting: `` We received the first three rounds and our -LRB- return fire -RRB- lasted about 15 minutes. What I could identify was three or four -LRB- muzzle -RRB- flashes coming from a certain area.'' `` At that time I immediately went to my machine gunner and tapped him on the shoulder and told him to return fire,'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> said. `` He returned fire, approximately 10 or 15 rounds, and I tapped him again and told him to cease fire.'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> said another Marine opened fire at the same time with a second machine gun, but `` none of the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> used their weapons or pistols because the word had n't been given to open fire.'' <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> said that while he and about 90 other Marines were engaged with more than 40 intruders, another group of nine <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen were surrounded by `` about 10 other intruders'' on a hill half a mile away. The two groups were in radio contact, <PERSON> Nevglovski </PERSON> said, and at least three 80mm mortar rounds were fired at the intruders' positions

 A boy and his three teen-age sisters were found mutilated in their home and stabbed so hard with steak knives that the blades broke, and a former boyfriend of one victim was arrested, police said. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON>, 20, was taken into custody after being treated at a hospital for a stab wound to his thigh and a cut on the hand. He was charged with four counts of capital murder, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grego </PERSON>, court officer for Magistrate <PERSON> Quon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> was taken back to <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after a late-night hearing and will be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Bexar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> on $ 4.05 million bail, <PERSON> Grego </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> had broken up with 17-year-old <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> in the past three weeks and had been named in two complaints filed by the teen-ager's father, one alleging a terroristic threat, said homicide Lt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>. `` He had been trying to get back with her and since he was unable to, we figure this is what prompted him to break into the house and commit these murders,'' <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was found slain along with her sisters, <PERSON> Jenniffer </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, 14, and brother <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON>, 13, in their mobile home early Friday. `` We figure he either surprised them in their sleep or there's a possibility that more than one person was involved, which would have kept them from running out or anything like that. We ca n't tell for sure,'' said <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said a girl called the 911 emergency number about 3:27 a.m. and said `` one of my sister's boyfriends is beating us up and has killed my sister.'' Police were able to trace the call and found the bodies at 3:55 a.m., <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. Police said at least five steak knives were used in the slayings and that more could have been carried off from the five-bedroom mobile home. `` It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. There are knives broken off in their necks,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a 28-year member of the department. `` It's a slaughterhouse.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mireles </PERSON>, who lives across from the trailer park, said there have been numerous robberies there and that she heard a commotion early Friday, and thought she heard gunshots. `` I heard a lot of screams,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mireles </PERSON> said. `` They were screaming, ` Help' and they were crying and screaming and I told my husband and he said, ` No, let's not get involved.''' `` He thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to see what was going on,'' she said. The 10-acre park in a quiet neighborhood has a full-patrol security system, plus a swimming pool and well-equipped recreation center, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, a supervisor for Mobile Home Park. He described residents as middle-class. `` These people have been screened,'' he said. The victims' parents, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, are separated. Mrs. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was living with the children but was not home at the time of the attack, police said. Police Lt. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said officers were unable to determine if the girls had been sexually assaulted. The bodies were so mutilated that police first reported that four girls had been killed. But Mrs. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> later confirmed that one was a boy. She collapsed after identifying them, police said. At one point, the victims' father struck a television cameraman and four officers restrained him from striking a second one. `` Get those cameras out of here. This is not a carnival!'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, a friend of the girls, said the family moved in about a month ago and were known for throwing parties for neighborhood friends. `` They loved to have fun. They just wanted some attention,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said. `` They just wanted friends.'' <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 20, said she had worked with <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> at a grocery store until Miss <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> resigned about four months ago. `` She would n't talk, but she asked me about married life and said she was wanting to move in with her boyfriend,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. `` They were always breaking up but she said she loved him. `` She said that he hit her and that he also broke into her other house but that she still wanted to marry him.'' <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> McCollum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> withdrew from school last November as a sophomore, and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> dropped out of school in 1985 as a junior.

<TEXT>
 The dollar plunged on world currency markets Thursday in reaction to bad news on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit despite a massive coordinated effort on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its economic allies to halt the slide. The dollar's steep dive served served as an ominous reminder to the world's economic powers that their best-laid plans to steady the global economy can be quickly disrupted by events. Just as it had done several times last year, the weakness in the dollar quickly spread to other financial markets, sending interest rates up sharply and pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by more than 100 points, its second three-digit loss this year. The market turmoil came only a day after the world's seven major industrial countries had issued a glowing communique bragging about their ability to hold the dollar stable for the past four months. Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the seven nations _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ reaffirmed on Wednesday their commitment to keep the dollar stable. They pledged to back up the commitment with coordinated intervention, the process by which governments dump other currencies in exchange for dollars as a way of supporting the greenback. Participants in the day-long Wednesday meeting said they had not been told in advance by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that the February trade deficit would be an unexpectedly large $ 13.8 billion, triggering the need for intervention. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is briefed a day in advance on government economic reports. The finance ministers professed satisfaction with the way their cooridnation effort had worked Thursday, but the dollar still closed sharply lower against other currencies. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 123.60 yen, breaking through a 125-yen barrier which has been considered the lower level for the greenback over the past four months. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Friday, the dollar opened a sharp 1.7 percent lower against the yen but stabilized later at that level on reports of heavy dollar-buying by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. While the global recession which some predicted following last October's market collapse has not materialized, the turmoil Thursday served as an chilling reminder of the continued fragility of world economy. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and finance ministers from other countries tried to put the best face on the dollar's tumble Thursday, contending that the speed with which the countries intervened to support the dollar showed that the drive for international cooperation was working. Currency traders reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the central banks of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were among those intervening to brake the dollar's fall. `` I think what you see today is a very good example of international cooperation because there has been concerted intervention in support of the dollar involving a very large number of countries,'' <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the British chancellor of the exchequer, said in a briefing for reporters. The surge in the trade deficit and the dollar's tumble were among the items discussed by the world finance leaders as they continued their talks Thursday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the prime architect of the three-year effort to manage the level of the dollar, was grim-faced when he arrived for the meetings, held at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He brushed past reporters without answering any questions, but later his office released a text of comments he made during the closed-door session in which he played down the significance of February's widening of the trade deficit and stressed the resolve of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies to keep the value of the dollar stable. `` Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic. What is important is that we are continuing along the general path of reduced imbalances,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made progress in reducing its huge federal budget deficits, something other countries have long urged. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> singled out <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for praise in efforts to stimulate their domestic economies as a way of keeping the global economy growing. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s comments were echoed by other finance ministers, who also dismissed the February jump in the deficit as an aberration. But the swift drop in the dollar's value raised questions of how successful countries will be over the long term in keeping the dollar at its present levels. Many economists have forecast that the dollar will eventually have to decline more to solve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade problems In their Dec. 22 accord, the countries pledged to keep the dollar stable around current levels. While the governments have never been specific about just what those levels were, speculation has put the lower limit for the dollar at 125 yen. After it fell below that level Thursday, West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, was asked whether the countries would have to accept a new level for the dollar. `` That is a very good question, a thousand-dollar question,'' he answered. The dollar turmoil also raised the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to tighten interest rates further in this country to defend the dollar. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, while slowing the American economy, are seen as a positive for the greenback because foreign investors are able to earn more on their dollar-denominated investments. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, head of the West German central bank, sidestepped questions about whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> should tighten up during a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. With <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> looking on, <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want to comment on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> monetary and fiscal policies.'' He said he believed that his country had done its part to stimulate world growth by lowering <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> interest rates. `` As far as -LRB- our -RRB- monetary policy is concerned, we could n't have done more. We have the lowest interest rates in the world ... and it would be irresponsible to pursue more expansionary monetary policies,'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said. It was a heated dispute between <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and the West Germans last year over interest rates which has been cited as one of the contributing factors to Oct. 19 stock market plunge. Since that time, world finance leaders have gone out of their way to stress harmony and coordinated efforts to keep the global economy from toppling into another recession.

 <PERSON> Jai </PERSON> alai players went on strike in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Thursday to protest what they say are unfair working conditions and harassment since organizing a union earlier this year. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aries </PERSON>, a lawyer for the 500-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike affected frontons in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and many of the 10 frontons in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Frontons are buildings that house courts where the handball-like game is played before spectators who bet on the matches. People who answered the telephones in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> said the frontons were n't open because players were n't working. There was no answer at the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> facility. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, two frontons in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> canceled performances Thursday. Frontons in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, remained open using non-striking and substitute players. Officials at all frontons in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> except <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said they expected to be open Friday. The others are in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> fronton </LOCATION>, said management signed about six players Thursday night and expected to have between 15 and 20 players ready for Friday's program There are about 550 jai alai players in the three states, <PERSON> Aries </PERSON> said. He said about 90 percent of them have joined the association. <PERSON> Aries </PERSON> said that members of the association have been forbidden from wearing the union's insignia and that at least five players have been told their contracts will be terminated. `` The players were unable to tolerate the continuing harassment and intimidation that has followed their organizing into an association,'' <PERSON> Aries </PERSON> said. `` They had put up with a lot during the course of their regular employment ... with contracts that allowed fronton owners to dominate them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has conducted hearings in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on the association's request that federal officials oversee union authorization votes at the 14 frontons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aries </PERSON> said there have been no decisions from the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> offices, and the hearings are continuing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Airlines are deliberately discriminating against blind people by forcing them to switch seats under the guise of safety while lacking a uniform seating policy, blind activists contend. Their complaint follows the second arrest in as many weeks involving the seating of blind people on airlines. In the latst incident, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, director of governmental affairs for the National Federation of the <PERSON> Blind </PERSON>, who is blind, was taken into custody Thursday at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after he refused to leave his seat in an emergency exit row on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight bound from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> attorneys later withdrew the complaint alleging criminal trespass, pending a review of the case, and <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON> was released, said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGraff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, 41, who was on his way to a conference in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> knew he was blind when they assigned him the seat and ordered him to move to harass him. `` I'm not a safety hazard to anybody. So I do n't believe that there's a basis for requiring me to move,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> late Thursday. `` I did n't like being singled out that way.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON> was adamant in his refusal to leave or to change seats, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> susbequently canceled the flight,'' the sergeant said. The DC-8 with 200 passengers was scheduled to leave at 3 p.m. CDT. Passengers were put on a later flight which left at 4:26 p.m., said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is not to seat blind people in emergency exit row seats because `` they're normally not manned by crew members. If there were a fire in the wing area, -LRB- the blind person -RRB- might be unable to assess the situation. `` Also, if we had to evacuate the plane ... it could slow the evacuation,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says plane evacuations must take no longer than 90 seconds. `` I do n't know the mechanics of how he got that seat,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. `` Once we realized what had happened, we attempted to relocate him to conform to our policies. In a similar incident, a blind attorney from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was arrested March 31 on a <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight at the <LOCATION> Washington-National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after she refused to move from a smoking section seat into an exit area seat, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reihing </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore-based federation. `` It is becoming clear to us that the pattern is deliberate. Our leaders, some who move with canes ... are being assigned those seats and being forced to move from them. It is a clear attempt to be be harassed,'' she said. `` Some airlines say we ca n't sit in exit rows. Some say we have to sit in exit rows,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, president of the federation's Illinois chapter. `` We regard it as blatantly discriminatory.'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> denied the allegation, saying, `` They're after the publicity.'' <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, meantime, planned to fly to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> today on another airline. `` I do n't believe in going along with violating a law,'' he said. `` I was n't causing a delay. I feel sad that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> caused a delay for other passengers and me. I feel about as sad about that as other passengers. `` How do I get justice?''

 About 500 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> students, some carrying beer cans and liquor bottles, held a Bring Your Own Booze rally on campus Thursday night to protest a ban on alcohol at outdoor events. About 200 of the students marched to the home of Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, who imposed the ban last week. No arrests were reported. The chancellor was out of town. Students sang `` Give booze a chance'' to the tune of `` Give Peace a Chance.'' `` This could definitely get out of hand but everyone here is a responsible drinker,'' said student <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> Deirdre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, vice chancellor for university relations and development, stood outside <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s house. `` As long as it's a peaceful demonstration, students have the right to express their opinion,'' she said. Students began defying the ban en masse Wednesday when nearly 1,000 marched on the administration building. `` Students who are of legal age have the right to drink responsibly at public events,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, president of the campus <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the Wednesday rally with other student organizations. He said students were particularly annoyed because <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> failed to consult with a student-faculty committee on campus drinking before issuing the ban. The chancellor contended alcohol played a large role in several racial incidents on campus, including a fracas involving hundreds of students after the 1986 World Series and an attack on two blacks by five whites in February.

 A suspected member of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> charged with possessing three homemade bombs was turned over Thursday to federal authorities trying to determine what he planned to do with the explosives. The 35-year-old suspect, who was identified by officials in his native <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> through fingerprints as <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, is listed by the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as a suspected member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had not yet established ties between <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> and any group. `` We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to answer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> service area in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION> after a state trooper found three bombs in his car, officials said. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGisi </PERSON> released Kikumura to federal agents without setting bail Thursday. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was taken to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> jail to be held for a hearing Friday before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. In a complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, authorities charged <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> with possessing a fraudulent visa and unregistered firearms. If convicted, he faces up to $ 260,000 in fines and up to 15 years in prison. State and federal officials heading a terrorist task force said Thursday they have little information about <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> and what he planned to do with the bombs. <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> had not spoken to federal officials since being taken into custody. According to Japanese authorities, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was acquitted in a Japanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in his luggage at an airport in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, which deported him. The Japanese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s arrest Tuesday had raised suspicions the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> might be planning attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations June 19 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which advocates `` simultaneous world revolution'' and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has been linked to a bloody attack on <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane in 1977. The group has been largely inactive in the 1980s, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials have expressed concern it might revive its terrorist activities at the Olympics in September. State police Superintendent Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said the terrorist task force decided to investigate because of the sophisticated nature of the bombs. `` These are the first devices of this type that we have come across,'' <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said. Neither federal or state officials would elaborate. According to the federal complaint, police said the bombs consisted of three 18-inch steel cylinders. There was a total of 15 pounds of black powder in the car, officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said authorities have learned <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> acquired an international driver's license in the name of <PERSON> Masatoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishizona </PERSON> on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Kishizono </PERSON> is a 36-year-old employee of a hospital in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, who had reported his passport missing, police said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly Thursday to slap aid and trade sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for failing to do enough in the war on drugs, ignoring a plea from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and warnings that sanctions would do more harm than good. The move, on a 63 to 27 vote, came after backers of the legislation said it would shock <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> into doing more to combat the growing drug flow coming across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' southwestern border. Earlier, the lawmakers had voted voted 54 to 40 against taking the same action against the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Similar bills were pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but the measures were given little chance of being finally enacted into law because of remaining procedural hurdles in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a threat that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto any such measure to reach his desk. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., sponsor of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> resolution, conceded that point, but said passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would `` send a message to the government of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'' and added, `` We are compelled to face reality. Opponents of the anti-drug sanctions protested that both <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, while they can be faulted for shortcomings, are making good-faith efforts to halt the flow of drugs through their countries into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders, had argued that imposition of sanctions against <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because would `` adversely affect every aspect'' of U.S.-Mexican relations. The Mexican <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> released a statement Thursday night rejecting the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote as `` foreign interference.'' `` It is a profound conviction rooted in our history and in our laws that it only falls to one's own people to define without foreign interference their institutions and that at all time only they have the inalienable right to conduct their destiny,'' the statement said. In addition, the statement said, `` No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples.'' During more than five hours of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate, several lawmakers suggested that backers of the sanctions were jeopardizing bilateral relations in response to election-year political pressure. `` It's a great opportunity to show them we're tough, show them who's boss, and that we're against drugs,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, R-R. But he noted that the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government has won praise from drug authorities for its cooperation. Penalizing the islands `` just does n't make much sense,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, noted that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the third largest customer for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gets 14 percent of its petroleum imports from its southern neighbor. `` This is likely to have a serious negative impact'' on that relationship, he said. Under a 1986 law, countries identified as production or transit points for illegal drugs must lose half their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid unless the president certifies that they are `` fully cooperating'' with the war on drugs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made such a certification on March 1 for 17 of the 24 countries on the drug-trafficking list, including the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. After that certification, several lawmakers in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began efforts to undo it. `` The purpose of this resolution is not to bash <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but to defend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, sponsor of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> resolution along with Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, R-N. But one colleague suggested that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has little room to criticize its southern neighbor. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., noted that marijuana is one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s largest cash crops and that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> streets are unsafe because of drug-related crime `` I wonder if we should n't decertify those states'' and cut off federal aid, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> asked. While neither the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> receives substantial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid, losing the administration's drug certification could lead to loss of other benefits, including lucrative sugar-import quotas, airline landing rights and trade preferences. Of particular concern to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was a requirement that if certification is lost, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives to international development banks must vote against future loans to the affected country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a weighted vote on the banks, but not a majority. Loans from the banks have been crucial to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which is laboring under a mammoth foreign debt. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had sent private diplomatic signals that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> persists in publicly embarrassing it through resolutions of non-cooperation, it is likely to evict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents and wage the anti-narcotics fight without outside aid, according to congressional and diplomatic sources. In other action, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved, on a voice vote, a non-binding resolution to place <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on the list of drug producing and transit countries, subjecting it to greater scrutiny and to possible similar sanctions next year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his letter, said the impact of the legislation `` would almost certainly be an increase in the flow of drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said earlier that the administration was aware of congressional concerns about the international drug trafficking problem. But he said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s advisers were prepared to recommend that he veto any legislation imposing sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> He said it was necessary to `` keep in mind the broader national security interests of our two countries and other interests such as trade, immigration and so forth.''

 A visit by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a government day care center turned into a pint-sized political rally when about a dozen toddlers began chanting `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'' over and over. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name was mentioned when a reporter shouted out a question about the Democratic contender while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was winding up his visit Thursday to a day care center at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Texas Talking with OPEC About Possible Cooperation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is talking with the folks who brought you the oil embargoes of the 1970s, looking for ways to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel in a bid to revive its struggling oil industry. By itself, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is still the seventh largest producer in the world, but its oil, real estate and banking industries have been devastated since a 1986 oil price collapse. Texans `` can not continue to bury our heads in the sand and hope everything is going to be OK,'' says <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, one of the three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates oil production in the state. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> met earlier this month with <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, and discussed the possibility that his state and the cartel would cooperate. More contacts are planned. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> newspapers on Tuesday that cutting <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> production to hold up prices `` is one of the things that has to be considered. It would be one of the items we would discuss'' at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s April 23 meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` We can do it to prevent waste,'' he said in an interview Thursday from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. From the 1930s to the early 1970s, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> played the role that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> can play today _ acting as the world's swing producer, whose production stabilizes the price of oil. The commission, by controlling the amount of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil produced, thus had a significant degree of control over prices. That influence dissipated with the rise of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel and since 1972, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> commission has allowed wells in the state to produce at 100 percent of capacity. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated its clout in 1973, when 11 Arab member nations, angered over the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, slapped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with an oil embargo that produced gasoline lines all over the country. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said that in the discussions with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, `` we are not trying to seek an alliance or cartel. We just want input. ... Our goal is one of stability.'' But <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, who is <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, told <PERSON> AP-Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last week after meeting with <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, `` Exchanging information is n't going to do the trick, is it?'' Last week, <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said he had discussed a more effective output monitoring system for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, which has been plagued for several years by member cheating. That point struck <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON>, oil specialist in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Lobel </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novins </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lamont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Flug </PERSON>. Noting that the commission for four decades had effective control over oil prices, <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> going over there and showing them how it's done.'' <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON> said cooperation with the cartel by the commission would be `` probably illegal'' under antitrust laws, but that was disputed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division who is now a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> The economic harm resulting from higher prices and reduced output `` is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are aimed against,'' said <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, but he added that it is `` fairly standard doctrine'' that the laws apply only to private action, not action by states. States also can file antitrust suits, and eight did so recently against insurance companies. One of the attorneys general involved, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was asked about the chances of a suit against <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> should it cut production in concert with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. His spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, replied, `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price-fixing has cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers billions, maybe trillions of dollars, and we would n't want to see a state of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> participating.'' But she said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office `` would want to know more about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law'' before commenting on any legal challenges. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> antitrust division, declined to comment. But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: `` You can imagine what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration thinks about it. It's a cartel that does not operate in <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. interests.'' On the record, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON>, press aide to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, said, `` It's the department's belief and the government's policy that assistance to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in its effort to manipulate the price of oil is not the correct approach.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had 201,000 oil wells, a third of the national total, at the end of 1986 _ down 8,000 wells from the year before. The state's 2.3 million barrels a day in 1986, the most recent year for which state-by-state statistics are available, was more than a quarter of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude production totaling 8.6 million barrels. Current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production is about 8.2 million barrels, and most analysts believe <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' production is more than 2 million barrels. Several analysts pooh-poohed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' chances of achieving anything by talking with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a joke,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a group which advocates `` pro-consumer'' positions. He noted that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has had trouble controlling prices in recent years. `` Since 1981, this organization has been a crumbling, disorganized, battling group of countries,'' he said. `` When they agree on action, it never works out. Within a month it's back to normal _ price discounting.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Safer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said a plausible <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> production cut to help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> might be 70,000 barrels a day. But he said another 70,000 barrels a day `` would show up pretty quick on world oil markets, I guarantee it'' _ perhaps even provided by other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producing states.

<HEAD>Tax Deadline Today but `Tax Freedom' Still 20 Days Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first return-filing season under the broadest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> income tax overhaul in history closes out at midnight. But the average American will have to work 20 more days to keep federal, state and local tax collectors at bay for another year. `` Tax Freedom Day'' will come May 5, the latest date since the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> began counting a half-century ago. If the government took every penny you earned until your share of the total tax burden were paid, the foundation reckons, you would have to work the first 126 days of 1988 just to meet those obligations. Thirty years ago, Tax Freedom Day fell on April 10. Several million Americans did n't have time to fret about such fanciful calculations. They were working up to the eleventh hour on their 1987 returns, and many were sure to be standing in line in front of mail drops as the midnight filing deadline approached. Any return not postmarked by midnight _ and carrying the correct postage _ could be subject to a late filing penalty. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> cautioned taxpayers not to ignore the deadline, even if they ca n't afford to pay all the taxes they owe. Although failure to pay on time can result in one penalty, failure to file can bring an additional one. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimated that about 6.2 million couples and individuals would apply for an automatic four-month extension of the filing deadline by mailing Form 4868 with a check for their estimated taxes. That is up about 20 percent from last year _ due in large part to all the tax-law changes that must be reflected on returns being filed this year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' 1986 overhaul of the tax law changed more than 2,700 provisions and led the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to create 48 new forms. But the typical individual was unaffected by the great majority of those changes and has to use few if any of the new forms. Nevertheless, taxpayers have been sufficiently confused about the new law to telephone more than 17 million questions to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and to order record numbers of explanatory publications from the agency. The new law reduced tax rates significantly and nearly doubled the personal exemption to $ 1,900. But it reduced or eliminated a number of deductions and exemptions, including those for sales taxes, medical expenses, moving, consumer interest and <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION>. One of the biggest sources of confusion was the requirement that every employee file a revised W-4 form so that the amount of tax withheld could be adjusted to mirror the new law. Many workers found the new form so complex that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had to revise it again. Eventually the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> announced it would not penalize any worker for failing to pay enough tax in advance on 1987 wages. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> itself is having trouble keeping up with the new law. As recently as Thursday, it was issuing advice to taxpayers on how they might avoid penalties that were caused by getting the wrong answer to a tax question from an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> telephone `` assistor.'' About 28 of every 100 callers are getting wrong answers, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> concedes. Economists for the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> say benefits of the across-the-board tax cut enacted in 1981 have been wiped out by tax increases voted in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987. `` Like the <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> Cat in ` Alice in Wonderland,' nothing remains but the smile,'' the foundation said. Tax Freedom Day calculations by the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research organization, assume that individuals pay all taxes _ including those collected from corporations. The economists simply divide all federal, state and local tax collections among taxpayers and assume that every penny earned each year goes to government until tax obligations are satisfied. Last year, Tax Freedom Day was May 4; this year's May 5 date is two days later because 1988 is a leap year. If taxes were viewed on the basis of an eight-hour work day, the foundation said, the average taxpayer would have to work 1 hour and 50 minutes a day to pay federal taxes, and another 55 minutes for state and local taxes. That's two minutes longer for federal taxes than in 1987 but the same as last year for state and local taxes.

 A federal grand jury is weighing testimony from a wealthy couple who won a $ 50 million lease for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offices after arranging to pay a $ 40,000 salary for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>. Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> on Thursday personally supervised the questioning of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON>, before the grand jury, something he does only when major witnesses are summoned. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> spent about three hours before the grand jury; his wife was there only an hour. She left at the grand jury's normal quitting time, indicating she might be called back. The Benders were accompanied by their attorney, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is investigating whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated federal law through any conflict between his personal financial dealings and his government job. Although <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said April 1 he did not have evidence to indict <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in cases involving telephone stock and a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> oil pipeline, Thursday's appearance by the Benders underscored the prosecutor's other announcement at that time: that he still had some cases to pursue. Meanwhile, trustees of the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that they never voted on the plan to hire <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at $ 40,000 a year with money donated by the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family foundation. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that a partnership headed by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> won a $ 50 million lease on <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offices after the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> put up the money to pay Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary at the MS society. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to attend a drug conference, was asked by a reporter about the matter but declined to comment. During a later stop at an Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Nationalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, he turned aside several questions about the lease arrangement, saying `` that's not on the subject of immigration.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday that he knew nothing about the lease but that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` still has full confidence in <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' MS officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> is president, donated the money in October 1985 to give Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, previously a volunteer, the salary for three years. Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> are MS trustees. Several MS trustees said they did not learn of that arrangement until newspaper accounts appeared in the last two weeks. Others, however, said the board had been advised earlier. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, wife of Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., said she first learned about Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary when her husband read a newspaper account Mrs. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, a trustee, said the issue of Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job was never discussed in any board meeting that she attended. Another trustee, <PERSON> Remmel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, gave a different version. `` I guess you might say it was reported to the board,'' said <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>. `` I can not say that a proposal was put before the board, discussed pro and con and then a vote was taken, but we were informed that this had been proposed. `` I was pleased,'' <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said. `` I was told the Benders had this foundation and they could make a contribution to MS or pay for someone's salary or designate for a specific purpose. We were delighted to know she -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- would be a full-time employee because she's a worker.'' The board meets quarterly and not all the trustees attend each meeting. Another longtime trustee, who spoke on condition she not be identified, said, `` I was shocked ... I was aghast when I saw it'' in a newspaper. She said she never missed a board meeting, but had no idea Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was being paid as MS development director. Attorney <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON>, also a trustee, said, `` I do n't recall a discussion at a board meeting'' about the plan to hire Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. He said, `` It is not normal to earmark a grant for the salary of a specific person. That's a little unusual.'' But he added, `` It's not necessarily something the board would get into to vote on or ratify. MS society attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said the arrangement was brought up in October 1985 at a special meeting to discuss expansion of Operation Job Match, a program to help MS victims find work. Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> was at the session, he said. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has subpoenaed records of Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job at the society and is known to be interested in a $ 50 million lease renewal won by the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership in May 1987. Most of the offices in the lease were occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which had complained about the building's maintenance, size, location and security. The Bender partnership sold the building 13 days after the lease renewal, earning a $ 22.6 million profit on a two-year investment. The lease was crucial to the sale, the new owner said. The <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership had bought the building in March 1985 for nearly twice its assessed value at a time when the government wanted to move more than a third of its offices elsewhere. Three months after the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership purchased the building, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration disclosed publicly that it had decided to retain the building. An attorney for the Meeses, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, denies any wrongdoing on their part in the transactions, but acknowledges that the Benders and <PERSON> Meeses </PERSON> know each other. The Benders refuse to discuss the matter publicly. A key government official said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> played no role in the real estate decision. Other <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> buildings have done business with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Government documents show that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and his two brothers, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, as a partnership, signed a lease in June 1985 to give the government more space in a downtown office building, One <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where it has leased several floors since 1971. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> occupies part of one floor there.

 Striking TV and film scriptwriters have agreed to go back to work under interim contracts at only two of the several independent producers that asked for relief from the walkout, the union said Thursday. East Coast members of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday to consider the request for relief and take an informal vote; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members met Wednesday. Vote totals were not released. <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> leaders had recommended against separate contracts because `` it could lead to divisiveness and destruction of morale among members,'' <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the outcome of the vote. However, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> membership approved two exceptions: The `` New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> Productions, which has produced such film hits as `` Animal House'' and `` Ghostbusters.'' The exceptions were granted because of unspecified legal considerations and because negotiations with the two producers `` were more advanced,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. It was not known how many scriptwriters would be affected by the decision to enter into separate contracts with the two production companies. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> could not immediately be reached for comment. An unspecified number of independent producers had asked the union for separate agreements that would allow them to resume work. Some 9,000 union writers went on strike March 7 over creative control and residuals from reruns and foreign distribution. The walkout shortened the season for many prime-time shows and stalled the start of some series. There have been no formal negotiations since March 10. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for TV and film producers, said the producers had no comment on the guild's decision not to seek side deals with independent producers other than the two exceptions. He held out little hope for Monday's negotiating session. `` There has been no change in our position,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` Unless this new meeting carries a lantern with it, we see no light at the end of the tunnel.'' On Thursday, about 300 union supporters rallied outside the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> building, where Paramount has offices. Among those appearing were writer and director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> and writers <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>.

 For Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> presidential primary culminates six weeks of frustration since his breakthrough in the South and may mark the end of his bid for the presidential nomination. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator is pinning his hopes on being able to distinguish himself in the remaining debates before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters and in his late television exposure. But so far, nothing seems to have worked for him in this critical state, and the air of desperation is unmistakable as <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> lashes at rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before sometimes unresponsive audiences. `` I've listened to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>; I like him,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Democrat who heard <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speak at a Wednesday night dinner in <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. `` I think he's a brilliant man, but he does n't seem real strong, as a candidate.''

His support remains essentially unchanged after spending half of a $ 1 million budget on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign, aided by prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign aides, including manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, contend the campaign will continue after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> no matter what. But one adviser, speaking on condition he not be named, said of the prospect of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> staying in the race despite finishing a distant third here: `` Can he? Sure. Should he? No.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> managed to raise $ 330,000 in one evening this week, at a reception with rich city Democrats at a fashionable <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel. Yet <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has a debt of $ 1.6 million so far, and appears to be putting all he can raise into television ads. He needs a 20 percent primary showing to win a restoration of his eligibility for most future federal campaign matching money. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> jump-started his campaign and became a serious contender with his victories in six Southern states on Super Tuesday six weeks ago. But rather than gaining momentum with his impressive showing, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s candidacy immediately stalled as the campaign moved into the North. His best showing since then has been 17 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and in four other states he failed to do better than 8 percent. Trying to catch up in the few days left to him, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> launched a vigorous attack on what his campaign regards as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' weakest flank _ his lack of experience in foreign policy. He accused the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of a revealing blunder in answering a newspaper's question on the scenario for use of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal, triggering a tense exchange of charges between the campaigns. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s attacks, however, run the risk of reinforcing an appearance <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has gained of a desperate, perhaps shrill, candidate. He has faced an array of complicating problems in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s complex, ethnic-dominated political scene He has appealed strongly for the influential Jewish vote, and pointed to a record of support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but faced charges of pandering in the process. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also has faced a quiet campaign of opposition through the suggestion that opponents of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should n't vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> because by hurting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> they would enhance <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s eventual outcome. `` Our thinking is <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would be better for Jews in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; the problem is we'd rather have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> than give too much power to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> woman who would give only her first name, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>. In affluent <PERSON> Rye </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermit </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> said, `` I would n't want to help <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in any way.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> addressed that issue head-on before suburban <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> Democrats. `` Some people have said in this election that one must vote on the issue of fear _ a vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I ask you to vote on the basis of hope, and leave your fears behind.''

<HEAD>PCB Contamination of People a Six-Generation Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For children born in the 22nd century, the adage `` You are what you eat'' may need to be rewritten to read: `` You are what your great-great-great grandmother ate.'' PCB contamination of people who eat tainted food is a problem than can span six generations, a researcher told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Thursday. A 20-year-old woman giving birth to a child passes on sufficient PCBs so that even if all exposure to the substance were stopped, `` I would still measure PCB in the body fat ... six generations in the future,'' said <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>'s figures suggest that at 30 years to a generation, children born in the year 2138 would still suffer contamination from PCBs ingested in 1988, inherited through the female line PCB production has been banned for years, but the substance, believed to cause cancer, continues to enter the environment through such sources as old electric transformers. Using earlier research into the transmission of polychlorinated biphenyls _ PCBs for short _ <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> calculated the amounts of the substance passed to an infant through nursing and retained in the infant's body. He said an infant nursed by a mother who regularly consumed <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> fish, which have been found to contain small amounts of PCBs, would be exposed to 6.2 milligrams of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> by the end of 12 months, and 5.3 milligrams would be retained in the infant's body. `` It is clear that infants nursed by mothers who have consumed <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> fish exceed recommended consumption guidelines -LRB- for adults -RRB- for their entire breast-feeding experience,'' he told the subcommittee on investigations and oversight. The level of PCBs retained by such infants, in terms of body weight, was more than seven times the maximum consumption level recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. A mother passes PCBs to a child not only through beast feeding but through the placenta before birth, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. Infants exposed to excessive PCB levels tend to be shorter, have smaller heads, be more likely to catch infectious diseases, and exhibit an inability to focus on their surroundings, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. A recent decline in <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> levels in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> has slowed, recent research suggests, with the substance circulating from the sediment into the water and back into the sediment again in a cycle of continuing contamination of the food chain.

 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped Thursday after the government announced a $ 13.8 billion trade deficit in February, the biggest since last October. The Dow Jones average of 30 stocks skidded 101.46 points to 2,005.64, a 4.8 percent decline. It was the year's second worst drop after a 140.58-point slide Jan. 8. The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks fell $ 99.7 billion, or 3.7 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The White House and most economists said the trade deficit was still improving in spite of the setback, but the markets took the news badly anyway. Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between imports and exports would be less than $ 12 billion, and they bailed out when the disappointing report hit at 8:30 a.m. EDT. `` There was a lot of wishing-makes-it-so -LRB- attitude -RRB-. People wanted to see a good number,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, chief economist of High Frequency Economics. He had predicted a $ 14 billion gap. The decline in the Dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points. Last week, it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points. The Dow had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. The news killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones nearly 11 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. The trade deficit report also battered major foreign markets. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, stocks fell sharply from their record highs at the opening of trading today but later recovered much of their losses. The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, down more than 250 points at one time, finished the morning session at 26,967.83, down 143.52 from Thursday's record close. The dollar opened a sharp 1.7 percent lower against the Japanese yen but later stabilized at that level on reports of heavy dollar-buying by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activity, the dollar had lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the yen, British pound and West German mark in spite of heavy intervention by virtually all the major central banks. Big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving trading partners an oversupply of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market. The trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong domestic economy was sucking in too many imports. Traders also feared a weak dollar could push up import prices, causing inflation and hurting fixed-income securities. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking, but still finished with a decline of roughly $ 11 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to roughly 8.87 percent, a three-month high.

 The chairman of the tax-law-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been hit with more than 2,000 letters from angry, befuddled taxpayers complaining about the tax changes he once billed as `` simplification.'' Even Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> acknowledges now that the system did n't get much simpler _ he blames last-minute tinkering with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 _ and he says the flood of complaints does n't surprise him. `` We have been waiting for something like this to happen,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., said Thursday But he said he had expected even more letters to arrive as today's filing deadline approached, perhaps closer to the 10,000 he got after inviting people in a 1985 television address to `` write Rosty'' if they wanted simpler tax laws. `` I must say, it's a dog that did n't bark as far as we're concerned,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said `` There are very few individuals who are writing.'' Committee aides said most of the letters contain copies of an article in Money magazine's April issue lambasting parts of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. `` Fight back,'' the magazine said. `` Send a message to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by checking off the boxes by the laws that outrage you, ripping out this article and sending it to the top tax lawmaker: The Hon. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>.'' The article criticized nine tax provisions, including a limit on the deductibility of individual retirement accounts, elimination of a deduction for married working couples and a higher threshold for claiming medical deductions. `` There is a lot of frustration out there, and what we're trying to do is address it,'' <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, Money's managing editor, said of the mail-in campaign. `` People are mad,'' he said. `` They're mad about tax reform. They're mad about how long it took them to fill their forms out. They're mad about losing their <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deduction.'' Pointing to two huge boxes of mail, aides said <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has gotten more than 2,000 letters in a couple weeks _ with no end in sight _ from angry taxpayers. `` In the name of tax reform and simplification, the federal government has once again botched it,'' wrote a couple from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Would you believe there are parts of this country where you ca n't support a family and live in a decent neighborhood on $ 50,000 per year?'' said a letter from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` There are, and the situation is worsening.'' From <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>: `` Being a middle-class American, I feel that once again we are the ones supporting our government, paying for Public Aid persons who could help themselves and carrying the wealthy people right along. When can we expect a change in the attitude of the government?'' The Internal Revenue Service says the changes are not without benefits, bringing lower maximum rates for most taxpayers and an increase in the average refund from $ 806 last year to $ 825 this year.

 Always interesting, the <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> was not trying for `` pretty'' with its premiere of `` Counterswarm'' at the City Center Thursday night. Consider <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s 1986 `` A Musical Offering,'' danced in caveman costumes to <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>. Or his 1985 `` Last Look,'' danced by apparently insane spastics. In `` Counterswarm,'' dancers proved they were up to <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s choreographed speed and athleticism Music for the 25-minute `` Counterswarm'' is from the Hungarian composer <PERSON> Gyorgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligeti </PERSON> and contains droning and shimmering tones. The two swarms were eight dancers in purple and eight dancers in red. The purple swarm dances first, with elbows bent and close to the body and hands cupped like cobra heads. They dart their arms out and back, looking like snakes striking. One couple dances, with cupped hands together behind their backs. They strut, giving the appearance of peacocks. A couple in red enters and dances briefly, the man seeming to be subservient, lifting the woman, who maintains a regal posture. The red swarm dances about, with shoulders shrugging, looking like chickens. Suddenly the red swarm turns futuristic, arms shooting up and back like antennae on robots. The purple swarm enters doing backward sommersaults, then walks around with knees bent, arms dangling like those of monkeys. A woman in red and two men in purple dance, looking like insects. After a blackout, a short final section has everybody on stage for a not very serious war. One person in red and one in purple rush together and bump stomachs. One couple grappled arms in an unfriendly stance as the curtain fell. We do n't know what `` Counterswarm'' represented. But it did n't represent either the lyrical or humorous, more fun side, of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> The company dances at the City Center through May 1.

<HEAD>Bishops Back `Conditional Acceptance' of Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A committee of bishops urges the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church to continue its `` conditional acceptance'' of nuclear weapons, saying they have been a significant factor in preventing nuclear war. `` In a dangerous world, a world of both widespread nuclear knowledge and extensive nuclear arsenals, we find condemning nuclear deterrence too drastic a solution and embracing it too simple a response,'' the committee said in a report to their fellow bishops. As a result, the committee added, `` the best moral evaluation is neither to condemn deterrence outright nor to accept it as self-regulating or normal.'' The report calls deterrence `` a significant factor in preventing the use of nuclear weapons'' and said it has `` contributed to a more cautious posture of the two nuclear powers in world affairs.'' The church adopted the `` conditional acceptance'' posture in 1983. The bishops, in urging its continuation, called the meeting of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December `` the beginning of responsible statesmanship.'' They said it raised cautious hopes `` that an authentically new opportunity for redefining the political relationship of the world's two major military powers may be at hand.'' The committee said the church's acceptance of nuclear deterrence should be based on seven points, one of which is `` significant reductions in strategic armaments, which exceed the requirements of second-strike deterrence.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headed the committee which worked for two years to produce the report. The committee will continue to receive recommendations before issuing a final version to be submitted to the next general meeting of American bishops, in <LOCATION> Collegeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, June 24-27. `` Our publics share a certain tragic destiny,'' the bishops said. `` We are both targets; the possibility of a future for our children is always an open question because the weapons that threaten both nations are ` absolute weapons' ... Publics can hope but governments must act.'' Despite the `` uncertain promise'' brought about by a better relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` there stands the historical fact of major additions to the strategic arsenals of both superpowers, weapons whose character and numbers decidedly increase the danger of nuclear war occurring,'' the report said. `` This pattern of policy is not adequate to the moral danger of the age, that these arsenals, by miscalculation or mistake, will escape human control and destroy in an hour the product of civilizations which it has taken centuries to build and shape.'' The bishops said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative must be limited to research and development and not advanced to deployment and that the anti-ballistic missile treaty should not be cast aside or overridden. They said each step in SDI should first be evaluated for its consequences in the arms race and that spending for the program be judged `` in relationship to the basic human needs of the poor in our country and in other nations.'' Said the bishops: `` We can not avoid our responsibility to lift up the moral dimensions of the choices before our world and nation.''

 Polls in the last week before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary show <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> well ahead of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> mired in single digits. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the highest measure of support, at 49 percent, in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released Thursday. The poll also gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> his highest numbers, at 34 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 45 percent to 28 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll and 46 percent to 34 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> poll, also released Thursday. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had only 8 percent support in the first two polls and 7 percent in the third. `` Certainly nothing much moved this week except for solidity to the front-runners,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll last week had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 47 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 31 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 6 percent _ virtually the same results as the new <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> survey, conducted by telephone Monday and Tuesday among 359 likely Democratic voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strong support went from 53 percent to 67 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s became nearly unshakeable, moving from 67 percent to 82 percent strong. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s strength remained at about 40 percent despite the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator's aggressive campaign style and a television advertising budget that aides hope will reach $ 1 million. In another bad sign for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the Jewish voters surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> still supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> overwhelmingly, despite efforts by the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign to win them over by taking a hard pro-Israel line on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues. Seventy percent of the Jews in the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, just 12 percent chose <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and 6 percent favored <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Jews account for up to a quarter of the Democratic primary vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with his customary overwhelming black support and support from about 16 percent of white voters. `` The number really needs to reach into the 20s in order for him to overtake <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON> said. The polls did indicate some room for movement: 5 percent were uncommitted and 8 percent undecided in <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION>'s poll, 8 percent uncommitted and 11 percent undecided in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey. The ABC-Post poll had 6 percent favoring some other candidate and 2 percent undecided. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll was conducted by telephone Monday through Wednesday among 581 likely Democratic voters and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points. The ABC-Post poll was conducted by telephone Wednesday among 176 likely voters, and has a margin of error of 9 points. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.

<TEXT>
 For the last century or so mankind has been engaged in an unintentional experiment with the Earth's climate. The results should be available soon, a scientist reports today. Warming of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, caused by industrial gases spilled into the atmosphere, could soon be large enough to measure with assurance, said <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` Thus, the greenhouse theory of climate change has reached the crucial stage of verification because of the inadvertent experiment being performed on the atmosphere by human activities,'' <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> reported in the journal Science. `` In a decade or two we should start to see something. If not, then it's time to go back to the drawing boards,'' <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The one fly in the ointment,'' he cautioned, is that the relatively small changes seen so far have occurred in steps and not gradually. Thus, if climate waits until the gases build up to a point to `` kick'' over a change, it may take longer to see warming, he said. In that case, significant changes might take 20 to 50 years, he said. Signs could include larger temperature rises in polar areas than near the equator; less precipitation in the middle latitudes where many crops are grown, and a rise in ocean levels, <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> said. Industrial gases can lead to climate change because they act somewhat like the glass of a greenhouse, allowing energy from the sun to come to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but trapping some of the heat that previously would have radiated back out into space. Such gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons. This trapped energy drives the Earth's climate out of balance, says <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON>. If the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues, he adds, `` the cumulative surface warming would, in the next two decades, become large enough to manifest itself unambiguously.'' `` The predicted changes, during the next few decades, could far exceed the natural climate variations in historical times,'' he wrote. Measurements over the last century or so indicate that the planet has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit. That amount of change could just be part of the natural variation in climate, he said. But if concentrations of greenhouse gases continue increasing, theoretical models indicate the warming could total as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit during the next century, a change <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> termed `` unprecedented.'' Still in question, though, are the consequences of such a change. For example, the warming could cause some melting of polar ice, a process that would tend to accelerate the warming even more by increasing the sunlight absorbed by the darker underlying water or land surfaces, <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> reported. Ice melting could cause an increase in ocean levels, causing widespread flooding of coastal areas, scientists have warned. And many have expressed concern that the warming could cause changes in general weather and climate patterns. Another area of uncertainty, <PERSON> Ramanathan </PERSON> wrote, is that of cloud formation. Warmer temperatures might increase the water evaporated to form clouds. Those clouds might reduce the incoming energy by brightening the planet's surface and reflecting more sunlight back into space, causing a cooling of the Earth. Yet clouds also are good at trapping infrared radiation headed back into space from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Thus they possibly could raise the surface temperature instead of cooling it.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders say the chamber is not in any hurry to vote on the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons, raising the possibility the pact may not be ratified before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> six weeks from now. `` I'm not driven by a calendar deadline. I want first, last and always to have a good treaty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told reporters The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has pushed for a ratification vote before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s May 29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said there is a possible `` hole in the treaty'' that first has to be filled. That question revolves around whether the treaty bans so-called `` futuristic'' weapons, using exotic technologies such as lasers, plasma, or ion beams. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the treaty is not likely to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor before early May, after the chamber returns from a week-long recess. When the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> finally votes, ratification is probable, according to both <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators, and both parties say the treaty will likely be supported by 88 to 90 senators. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been meeting behind closed doors with administration officials, including chief treaty negotiator <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, to try to resolve the issue of which technologies are banned. The treaty does n't mention futuristic weapons, but <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> and administration officials have said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> understands the pact bars the possession or flight testing of all medium-range weapons, no matter how they are armed or operate. The Armed Services panel has already endorsed the pact, but it is planning to issue another report on the `` futuristic'' weapons issue, and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said no floor action is likely before that report is done. Two former top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said in letters released Thursday they do n't believe the treaty bans futuristic weapons. The pair, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, outlined their views in letters to the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> wrote, `` I can simply state that there was no understanding of any kind that I knew about that the treaty covered anything related to these so-called futuristic weapons.'' `` Certainly, there was no discussion or evaluation of the military sufficiency questions involved in banning futuristic weaponry that I ever participated in, and I never heard any others having such a discussion,'' said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. `` Indeed, had there been any suggestions that ` futuristic' weapons were banned, I would have opposed it in the strongest possible terms, because it would have had an obvious adverse effect on -LRB- the Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB- for us to agree to any limitation on any systems not yet designed or ` futuristic' systems ...'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said he never knew about any such ban that was discussed in National Security Council meetings he attended or in `` any meeting with Soviet officials with which I am familiar.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, a private group, announced a nationwide campaign to defeat the treaty or to delay the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said black umbrellas emblazoned with anti-treaty rhetoric would be sent to all senators to symbolize the campaign. `` Open, the umbrella symbolizes the protective shield which, for more than four decades, has prevented Soviet domination and intimidation of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` Closed, the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit of appeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized -LRB- <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s dealings with <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> precisely 50 years ago.''

<TEXT>
 Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to tell Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their summit meeting that continuing Soviet weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are undermining peace efforts in the region. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> rejected Soviet denials that they are supporting rebels in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and said a stable peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be beyond reach if the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> does not change its policy. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said Thursday that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> should prepare for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit next month by meeting with the five Central American foreign ministers, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s included. Such an encounter would end a three-year freeze on substantive diplomatic contacts between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, insisting on anonymity, said there is no prospect for a meeting along the lines proposed by <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> unless the Sandinista government demonstrates a clear will to negotiate seriously with the Contra rebels when talks on a permanent settlement are held. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special envoy <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> sounded out leaders from four Central American countries friendly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week and they generally agreed the time was not ripe for a regional consultation that would include the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the officials said. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> himself had expressed that view last week and one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official expressed surprise that the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> leader had made the proposal Thursday without reference to the qualifications he had made in his talks with <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, author of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan, talked about his proposal during a luncheon appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> and later discussed it with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. At the luncheon, he was sharply critical of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Following the congressional cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels in February, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> sent an open letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealing for similar Soviet restraint. He said he received a response from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that contained a `` lot of cynicism.'' The Soviets denied sending aid to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and also said they were supporting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government militarily because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was supplying its allies in the region, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said He said it is `` quite obvious'' that both <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are supporting the leftist insurgencies in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> in violation of the peace plan the five Central American president signed last August. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has accused <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> of sending weapons to leftist forces in the region but has not made the same allegation recently about the Soviets. Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said recently that his country provides `` political and moral support'' to the Salvadoran rebels but that there is no need to send them weapons because they are self-sufficient. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he decided to write to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and not to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> because the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader would not be sending weapons to Central American insurgents without the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s consent. In his prepared remarks, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the Soviets send military supplies `` worth millions'' to Central America. `` We ought to obligate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to rectify its policy about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we need for it the political backing of all friendly nations,'' he said. `` The coming withdrawal of Russian troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> provides hope for the political rectification needed in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said the Soviets sent about $ 450 million in military supplies to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last year and that shipments over the first two months this year were above the comparable period in 1987.

 The dreaded income-tax deadline is here, but some folks headed for the midnight mail will also be given a chance to bash a used car, gobble headache powder, sip coffee or nibble frozen yogurt. Some communities have decided to brighten the typically somber undertaking by making it into an `` event.'' Those frustrated by the new tax forms, for example, may want to do their mailing in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, Ark. Radio station KZOU-FM will broadcast from a parking lot where the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has set up a special mail box, to be collected at midnight. The station will offer last-minute taxpayers a chance to vent their feelings by taking a sledgehammer to a used car. A small charge for taking part will be used for charity. Things will be a little more festive in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has set up special collection points at shopping centers. Frozen yogurt bars will be offered to taxpayers by radio station KOOL-FM, while at another location KESZ-FM will give out fast food coupons, said postal service spokeswoman <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. Tax night in her city has become `` quite an event,'' she remarked. The nation's capital is n't exempt, either, with the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts joining in. The Center is using the rite of last-minute tax filing to promote the performance of `` The Rite of Spring.'' A postal clerk will set up shop at the Center from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. for patrons of the arts to buy stamps and mail their taxes en route to their dose of culture. For Arkansans who have been too busy completing their taxes to consider going to a concert, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> radio station KSSN-FM is setting up a `` tax aid'' station to give out coffee, donuts and headache powders at the general mail facility there, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reports. Those who prefer Alka-Seltzer with their coffee, donuts and taxes can head north to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where station <ORGANIZATION> WIBA </ORGANIZATION> will offer succor to the late filers. Postal Service consumer advocate <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said she could n't be specific about the last day, but that the post office expects to handle 30 million tax returns nationwide in the `` last couple of days.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> reminded taxpayers to use the correct postage _ under this month's rate hike, it now costs a quarter for the first ounce and 20 cents for each added ounce. She also encouraged use of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> envelopes because they make the mail easier for postal workers to handle. Taxpayers seeking last-minute postmarks annually flock to post offices, and service until midnight will be available in many communities to accommodate them, she reported. Indeed, streetcorner collection for people driving by will be available in dozens of cities. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the move this year is to decentralize the postal rush. `` Traditionally we have quite a bit of congestion at the main office on that night, so we're trying to solve that,'' explained spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheek </ORGANIZATION>. Special pickups have been scheduled for mail deposit boxes in front of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s 33 postal stations. That mail will be collected at 11:30 p.m., and postmarked April 15, she said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WCXR </ORGANIZATION> is offering contest winners free stamps and a limousine ride to the post office. Volunteer or government tax preparers will be on hand to help late filers in many locations including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Postal workers will collect tax returns from motorists at all four corners of the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> main post office and a clerk will be stationed inside to weigh items and sell stamps until midnight. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the Terminal Annex and Worldway Postal centers will be open until midnight, and a hotline to the main post office will give information on other late collection points in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. An Express Mail van manned with two clerks will be parked in front of the Denver Main post office to collect tax forms until midnight. And in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, two-ton collection trucks will loom at three locations around the main post office.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of a $ 1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget sets up a battle with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over domestic spending and how far <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can stray from its deficit-reduction pact with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. This year's budget debate is framed by the bipartisan agreement with the president, which sets out limits for taxes and major spending categories. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have now passed budgets obeying the pact's spending caps of $ 294 billion for the military and $ 16.1 billion in foreign aid. And neither chamber included tax increases beyond the $ 14 billion enacted last December. So when the two sides begin meeting next week to resolve their differences, the focus will be on domestic programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan, approved Thursday by a 69-26 vote, is similar to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan in supporting large increases in spending on AIDS research, education, and aviation safety. Both also reject <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request to terminate several domestic programs But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan is closer to the president's in several areas. It contains sharp increases for the space program and science. The House last month opted for more modest boosts in those areas in order to better protect mass transit, housing and development programs. Both plans fudge the numbers in order to claim they stay within the domestic spending limits, but they do it in different ways. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to use what <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., called `` creative accounting'' _ simply declaring that some expenses were not covered by the agreement The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, eager to make room for a new $ 2.6 billion anti-drug program but unwilling to make cuts elsewhere in the budget, at the last minute set up a special fund. Declaring the money would n't be tapped unless a `` dire emergency'' were declared, the budget simply does n't count that spending yet. Still, budget leaders from the two chambers said they hoped to reach agreement quickly. `` There are obvious differences,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., said in a written statement `` With good will, I am sure these differences can be resolved.'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said the talks between the two chambers would begin next week and, he hoped, go quickly. But Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the budget committee, said, `` It is a more formidable challenge than I thought it would be'' in the wake of the deficit agreement. The budget is a congressional resolution which does not require the president's signature, but it guides lawmakers as they pass their annual fiscal legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a self-imposed deadline of April 15 for finishing the budget. It has failed to meet the deadline again, but things are closer to being resolved at this date than they have been in recent years. There was no expression of concern in either the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> about the tardiness. While millions of taxpayers must file their returns by midnight tonight or face a penalty, there's no punishment for the lawmakers if they do n't figure out on time how to spend the tax dollars. Those tax dollars still do n't cover government expenses in either the administration's or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' budgets. But they all claim to meet the $ 136 billion deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said even those deficit numbers were based on too-optimistic White House estimates of a growing economy `` The wreckage of our fiscal policy will haunt the next president and presidents to come,'' he said.

 Tourists at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s Independence National Historical Park are n't getting the whole story about the birth of the nation, says a group fighting for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of a burial ground for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s army. The 2,000 members of the undermanned army were buried more than 210 years ago in what is now <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, and they should be honored by making the square a national park, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> energy and lands subcommittee was told Thursday. Washington Square receives scant tourist attention compared to adjacent Independence Hall and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. `` How pathetic that these greatest of patriots were buried without even a headstone to mark their contribution,'' <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazin </PERSON> said. `` The fact that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> is not a part of our <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is a disgrace to their memory and an embarrassment to all who pride themselves on being an American.'' In 1777, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, later the second president, wrote in a letter to his wife, `` I never in my whole life was affected with such melancholy'' as at the sight of the graves and trenches. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> wrote he had been told that `` upwards of 2,000 soldiers'' were buried at <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, later renamed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Only in 1957 was the flame of the tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier placed at the square. Now, it is time that `` those who fought and died and are buried in unmarked mass graves in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> should be honored and celebrated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Society of the Sons of the Revolution.

Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., and other backers envision <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, which owns the land, leasing it to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps for $ 1 a year `` As the bicentennial of the Constitution has just been celebrated, we must not forget those who made it possible,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. A similar bill was introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa., during the previous session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> It passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but was not acted on in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 Emotional ceremonies remembering the victims of Nazi atrocities included warnings against modern-day rights abuses and an award to an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> town for resisting Nazi-style white supremacists in the 1980s. Survivors of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> arrests 50 years ago wept as they lit candles Thursday with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the annual `` Days of Remembrance'' program of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Holocaust Memorial Council. The ceremonies at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also featured a hymn honoring Gypsy victims of Nazi atrocities, prayers by protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clergymen, and an appeal from Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> not turn its back on human rights abuses around the world. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he was shaken by a visit to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp in February. `` Do not forget, and do not allow the world to forget the inhumanity of which mankind is capable when it denies the sanctity of human life,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` resist the recurrent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> temptation toward isolationism'' and continue to work for human rights in other countries. High standards of education and culture attained by the Germans did not insulate them from `` the virus of religious and racial prejudice,'' he said. The council, which was set up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to build a $ 50 million memorial in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, awarded an <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> to retired Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, who commanded forces that helped defeat the Germans and liberate <PERSON> Wobbelin </PERSON> concentration camp. `` We who did our share, we wo n't forget _ never will we forget, never,'' said <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> after the audience of several hundred officials, diplomats and other guests gave him a standing ovation. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Couer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, also received an <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> medal for being among the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers into <PERSON> Wobbelin </PERSON>. In addition, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> accepted a certificate honoring <ORGANIZATION> Couer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION> citizens for `` standing fast and speaking out in the face of threats and violence perpetrated by the members of a neo-Nazi paramilitary group,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which made its headquarters near the town in 1982. `` Constant vigilance is the price of freedom,'' the town's award read. Stone, who was a high school and college history teacher before being elected mayor in 1986, said he spent only a few minutes in the concentration camp, but it changed his life. He said he tried to instill in his students the conviction that `` this thing must not happen again.'' The program included a ceremony in which six members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and six people who survived the wave of arrests of Jews in November 1938 lit candles. <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesser </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, now an <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, travel agent, wept as she participated in the candle-lighting with Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, R-Ill. She said later she was 11 when soldiers stormed through <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, burning her Jewish school and the synagogue next to her home `` I ca n't help reliving it and being amazed that I am here now,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>. She said she had never participated as part of a Holocaust observance program. The site for the Holocaust Memorial, next to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engraving </ORGANIZATION>, has been cleared and construction is expected to take about 2 -LCB- years.

<HEAD>Union Says Mandatory Health Benefits Would Cut Public Assistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional proposals to raise the minimum wage and require employer-sponsored health insurance could save taxpayers millions of dollars in subsidies for the poor and uninsured, according to a labor union study released today. `` Our study shows that the public picks up an enormous tab for those employers who pay their workers sub-poverty wages and offer no health coverage,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said of its study of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home care workers. By the union's calculations, `` passing the current minimum wage and minimum health bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would reduce taxpayer subsidies to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' -LRB- home care -RRB- program by $ 32.7 million in 1992.'' The savings would be achieved through reductions in cash assistance, Medicaid and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and indigent care costs, as well as higher tax collections from home health care workers, the union said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is weighing plans to increase the minimum wage from the current $ 3.35 to $ 5.05 in 1992 and to require employers to provide minimum health benefits to their workers. The service employees union based its conclusions on a survey of 1,031 home health workers in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The workers, roughly representative demographically of the county's 40,000 home care employees, earn an average of $ 3.72 an hour. Sixty percent of those surveyed had no health insurance and more than half needed public support through direct cash benefits from the government or health services from public hospitals and community clinics. Assuming similar proportions throughout the home services work force, the study said, public subsidies for cash and health benefits amount to $ 84 million a year. Federal dollars underwrite 61 percent of these subsidies, the study said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> study was released in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearings Thursday and today on the health plan. _ End Embargoed Material _ A so-called `` minimum health'' bill, introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., has already cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> It would require employers to provide a minimum health insurance package to people working 17.5 hours a week or more. Benefits would have to include hospital and doctor care, prenatal and baby care, diagnostic testing and catastrophic protection. Employers would pay at least 80 percent of the premium. Pool arrangements and a phase-in period would make plans more affordable to small or new firms. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill also says very small or new employers would only have to provide catastrophic protection. There are an estimated 37.2 million Americans without health insurance. About two-thirds of them are workers or dependents who would be covered by the Kennedy-Waxman bill. In testimony Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health, chaired by <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> argued that the Kennedy-Waxman bill would cause many workers to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs. But the president of another business group cited a strong and `` growing trend of acceptance among many major companies.'' `` With each month, we hear from more members who think that a federal mandate is far from the worst alternative. And, many of the changes we wanted have been accepted,'' said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldbeck </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which represents hundreds of Fortune 500 companies and other employers. One small-business owner told the subcommittee he feels ethically obligated to offer medical insurance. He urged passage of the bill, saying it would make policies more affordable and even the playing field. `` In my attempts to be responsible now and in the future, I am put at a competitive disadvantage against those -LRB- employers -RRB- who do not insure,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, owner of a carpentry and construction firm in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said he had been on the other side of the fence and experienced long-term debt when his wife became ill. Other uninsured employees also recounted their experiences with sporadic, inadequate medical care and sky-high bills

<TEXT>
 Shrimpers nationwide have been granted a reprieve from federal regulations requiring them to outfit their vessels with devices to exclude turtles from their nets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> told the government Tuesday to stop enforcing the regulations until the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rules on a lawsuit filed by the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> attorney general's office and Concerned Shrimpers of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Shrimpers contend the devices are expensive, cumbersome, and would drastically cut the size of their catch. Environmentalists say they are necessary to protect endangered and threatened species of turtles. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> upheld the regulations as lawful in a Feb. 29 ruling but decided this week to prohibit enforcement while his earlier ruling is appealed. `` We're pleased that Judge <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> agreed with the state's argument that little harm, if any, would be done to sea turtles if shrimpers continue to trawl without TEDs -LRB- turtle excluder devices -RRB- until the case is finally adjudicated,'' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guste </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said on learning of the ruling Thursday. `` We argued that shrimpers would have to go to great trouble and expense to equip their nets with TEDs,'' he said. `` The possibility remains that the appeals court will reverse <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s -LRB- earlier -RRB- ruling and not require shrimpers to use TEDs.'' <PERSON> Guste </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> shrimpers could lose up to 15 percent of their catches if they have to use the devices, meaning less tax revenue for the state. In his order this week, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said shrimpers have had trouble obtaining the TEDs and getting adequate training in their use. `` We still maintain the regulations are valid and lawful and necessary to protect turtles,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're preparing the papers to seek a cancellation of his order and an expedited ruling from the court of appeals.'' <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> drafted the regulations to protect endangered and threatened turtles, most notably the `` critically endangered'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley sea turtle, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I'm thrilled with Judge <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s ruling. This is the first major victory in the shrimpers' battle to stop TED regulations, and it is important recognition that the TED regulations are impractical,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> and the environmentalists will probably ask that the court of appeals to overturn this decision, but I believe that the evidence is overwhelming that shrimper compliance is impossible,'' said <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> was phasing in the regulations depending on location _ they took effect March 1 along the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>, on Jan. 1 in <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> near the Keys, and in October near <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The regulations were to take effect for the rest of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast May 1. `` We know they do n't work,'' Tee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, president and executive director of Concerned Shrimpers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said of the TEDs. More than 100 shrimping vessels converged on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> in February to protest the regulations, <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Megginson </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, said the devices would create enormous problems for shrimpers and the state, which would have to help enforce the law. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has 32,000 commercial and recreational shrimpers, and there were n't enough of the devices on the market to go around, she said.

<TEXT>
 Israeli orders to demolish a new mosque being built by villagers in their spare time has stirred religious and nationalist passions in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village. Hundreds of Arabs formed a human wall around the dusty hilltop site Thursday after the Israeli military government ordered the mosque torn down because it was being erected without a permit. `` If the bulldozers arrive, they will have to bury us inside the mosque,'' <PERSON> Seif </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, 50, said as he and hundreds of other villagers surrounded the half-finished limestone building. Villagers claimed the permit was withheld to punish them for taking part in the 18-week anti-Israeli uprising and for refusing to accept Israeli-appointed leadership. Since Dec. 8, at least 146 Palestinians, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a 15-year-old Jewish settler have been killed in riots in the occupied territories. But <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said they want to halt construction because the new mosque, an annex to a 61-year-old mosque, was built over archaeological ruins that may help identify <LOCATION> Anata </LOCATION> as the birthplace of a biblical prophet. The military government approved a four-day reprieve hours before the scheduled demolition Thursday, but the dispute has produced strong anti-Israeli sentiment among villagers. `` The Israelis do n't want more mosques. They are afraid it will help the Islamic movement. And because of the uprising, they want to take revenge against us,'' said <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, wearing a white prayer cap and a gray pin-striped robe. Minutes later, an army jeep pulled up the hill, and shouts of `` The soldiers are coming!'' swept through the crowd. Village elders in white Arab headdresses restrained hot-headed youths pushing toward the jeep, telling them not to provoke the soldiers. A lieutenant colonel climbed out of the jeep and toured the mosque with village elders. The officer told residents that they had won a reprieve until Monday, when the military government is to meet with <LOCATION> Anata </LOCATION> residents. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafovitch </PERSON>, a spokesman for the military government, indicated the demolition order might be canceled to avoid a violent confrontation. `` We know religous matters are very sensitive and we are going to work out a solution,'' <PERSON> Rafovitch </PERSON> said. He said a construction permit was denied because the mosque was being built on ruins from the Byzantine, Roman, Hellenistic periods and even the Iron Age. One of the mosque's outer walls is a yard away from the roofless ruins of a Byzantine church. <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> Biran </PERSON>, an archaeologist who has excavated sites in nearby villages, said remains underneath the church might provide clues as to whether <LOCATION> Anata </LOCATION>, called Anathoth -LRB- City of Refuge -RRB- in the Bible, was the birthplace of the prophet <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON>. He noted that <LOCATION> Anata </LOCATION>, just northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, has been declared an historical site, and that all building was strictly regulated. But villagers claimed the military government was trying to punish them for refusing to accept Israel-appointed village leaders. Construction of the mosque began about two months ago to provide more space for worshipers who have been forced to pray in the streets surrounding the old mosque. Residents have donated material and about 200 villagers labored at the site in their spare time. `` This is our mosque and I worked hard,'' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, who helped carry bricks and mix cement. `` It is a gift to God,'' added <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>. `` This land should be exempt from regulations.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Urges The Outlawing of Witchcraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Witchcraft is sweeping <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and must be outlawed so British children do n't fall into the `` sordid, sexual and diabolical grasp'' of those who practice it, a lawmaker told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, asserted Thursday that many people convicted of child abuse had been involved in witchcraft initiation ceremonies. `` People laughed when I spoke nine years ago about child abuse. Most people are listening now,'' said <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, asking for a debate on the subject. `` I now warn the House _ witchcraft is sweeping the country.'' His comments were met with laughter from other lawmakers. House leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON> rejected the call for a debate but urged <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> to pursue the subjects he thought important. Later, <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> said he would urge the introduction of legislation banning witchcraft, with prison sentences for offenders. `` These are extremely devious, evil people,'' he said. `` If we are to protect children from their sordid, sexual and diabolical grasp we must bring in new laws to wipe witches off the face of the earth.'' He said he had evidence that a vicar in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had surveyed 300 14-year-old pupils, and 87 percent had said they had dabbled in the occult. `` I have not gone mad,'' he said. `` This is a serious and growing problem which must be exorcised.'' The crime of witchcraft was abolished in 1951 with the repeal of the 1735 Witchcraft Act.

 Strange smells noticed by noses from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the last week have confounded experts, who sniffed out possible causes ranging from a No. 73 city bus to a freak change in the atmosphere. After an unpleasant gas-like odor caused one of the biggest evacuations in peacetime <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Wednesday in a busy shopping area, an even more widespread smell Thursday was reported by hundreds of people in calls to fire and environmental officials. `` I could smell it when I left my home in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> -LRB- southwest <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -RRB- this morning,'' said a fire brigade spokeswoman. `` When I got off the train in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> I could still smell it.'' Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> environmental group was inundated with calls from residents in <LOCATION> Oxfordshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, all in the south of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> within a 50-mile radius of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I contacted our office in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and apparently there was a similar smell in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last week,'' said an official from Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice. `` The theory is that it was caused by a freak atmospheric condition.''

<HEAD>Half Of Old Growth in Northwest's National Forests to Be Sold</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is defending a plan to log about half the old-growth timber in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> national forests, saying such action is needed to maintain the region's forest products industry. In testimony Thursday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, forest service chief <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> predicted that old-growth timber would have to be logged on about 3 million acres in the next 50 years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> because second-growth trees are too young to sustain the harvest. `` Alternatives do n't exist if you want to maintain the timber industry in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rindy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s director of government affairs, said it was the most clear-cut signal to date of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans. `` It's not so much new as that they have finally been forced to talk about the numbers publicly,'' said Ms. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. The head of the subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., likened the harvest of old growth to cutting down `` Sherwood Forest'' of Robin Hood fame `` Are you stealing our heritage?'' he asked <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` We will be protecting some of our heritage and the forest-products industry,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said there are roughly 7.5 million acres of what the forest service considers old-growth forest in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, with about 83 percent or 6.2 million acres in national forests. The agency plans to offer for sale about half those trees, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. At present about 50,000 acres of old-growth timber is harvested annually. About 700,000 acres of old-growth timber is included in various wilderness areas in the region and already is protected from logging. `` Are you going to cut ancient trees?'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't know what they are,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> then asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would cut `` tall, beautiful trees.'' `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said after the hearing that he was convinced there was enough other timber available in Northwest forests to maintain a healthy forest-products industry. `` There are plenty of other trees they can use,'' he said. `` You do n't have to build houses out of old trees. I would hate like the devil to see these old, beautiful trees cut down.''

 An experienced skydiver who was killed after leaping from a plane without a parachute had forgotten to put on a chute before an earlier jump the same day, a federal investigator says. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, 35, fell 10,000 feet to his death April 2 while filming an instructor and student at the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sport Parachute Center. The fatal jump was his third of the day. `` There was no problem with the first time, during which he videotaped the jump of a student and instructor,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigsbee </PERSON>, an inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` On the second, he forgot to put on his chute but one of the other parachutists brought it to his attention before he boarded the plane.'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> made the same mistake when he boarded the plane for the third jump, but no one noticed, <PERSON> Rigsbee </PERSON> said. After viewing the tape <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> made on that last jump, investigators said it appeared <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> had been reaching for the release pin of a parachute that was n't there. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'s videotaping may have caused confusion, <PERSON> Rigsbee </PERSON> said. `` The harness <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> wore for the video equipment is similar to that of a parachute.

<HEAD>Companies To Phase Out High-Estrogen Birth Control Pills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says birth control pill manufacturers have agreed to phase out high-estrogen pills based on a finding that they are no more effective than lower-dose pills and could heighten the risk of blood clotting. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the three manufacturers _ <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ortho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ will phase out distribution of the pills over a six-month period to allow physicians time to switch their patients to lower-dose estrogen pills. The action follows a recommendation by an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel that the high-dose pills _ those containing more than 50 micrograms of estrogen _ be withdrawn because of the heightened risk of blood clotting. `` I applaud the responsible decision of these manufacturers,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Low dose contraceptives are quite safe and, for healthy young women, are considered to be the most effective reversible means of preventing pregnancy.''

<HEAD>Doctors Discuss Ethics of Harvesting Donor Organs from Doomed
Infants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The immediate harvesting of organs from infants born with most of their brains missing could threaten entire groups of patients who have lost the capacity for thought, two medical ethicists say. Such a policy of taking the organs for transplant before the infants are declared brain dead also violates medical ethics, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arras </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON>, writing in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Because these infants, called anencephalic, inevitably die within days or weeks and many children require organ transplants, a debate has begun over the appropriateness of using anencephalics as donors _ and how soon. `` These arguments are by no means unique to anencephalic newborns,'' <LOCATION> Arras </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> wrote in their commentary. `` They are equally applicable to other severely damaged infants as well as adults in permanent vegetative states. We do not believe society is willing to harvest organs from living patients who have permanently lost the capacity for intelligent thought.'' Anencephalic infants have a brain stem, enabling them to breathe. They have no cerebral cortex, the part of the brain allowing thought and voluntary movement. Between 2,000 and 3,000 anencephalic infants are among the 3 million children born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates. `` Organ donation is very laudable, and people say these kids will inevitably die,'' Shinnar, a pediatric neurologist at <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But he added, `` What if there are not enough anencephalics and the transplant needs are greater two years from now? Who do we look at next?'' The debate intensified in October following newspaper reports that organs had been harvested from anencephalic infants and transplanted into other children in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` In the West German case, they took a baby from delivery, put a tube -LRB- of oxygen -RRB- in its mouth, took it to the operating room, harvested the organs and buried it,'' <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said. `` And in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although it did not pass, there was a bill in the legislature in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to have these children declared ` brain-dead' at birth,'' he said. Legal definitions of brain death used in making medical determinations require an end of all brain functions, including those of the brain stem, <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said. In December, the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> developed a medical protocol under which anencephalic babies are to be used for transplants only after brain death occurs. Six anencephalic infants were kept alive by respirator for a week under those guidelines, though none ultimately became an organ donor, said <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. `` We wrote our article before the protocol was developed,'' <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said, `` and this certainly lessens the magnitude of the ethical debate.'' But, he said, `` this protocol is not without its problems as well. What about extending the tragedy for the parents of an anencephalic child?'' Anencephaly can be detected before birth with ultrasound, the commentary said, and some doctors consider abortion appropriate as late as the final three months of pregnancy. `` Should we be encouraging pregnant women, in essence, to carry these children to term to provide spare parts?'' <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said.

 There was no signs of celebration in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>'s hot and dusty streets, no shots fired into the air as people do in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> when they are happy about something. The Soviets had just signed the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ticket home from neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but the prevailing mood among Afghan refugees encamped here for years was skepticism and indifference. <PERSON> Tanvir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, a taxi driver, said: `` Agreement? What agreement? ... It will make no difference. The war will end when the refugees go home.'' In Camp No. 6 of the nearby border town of <LOCATION> Munda </LOCATION> sat 34-year-old <PERSON> Israyal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghairad </PERSON>, a school teacher from <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province in northeastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` We're not concerned with this agreement,'' <PERSON> Ghairad </PERSON> said of the accords signed Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Afghan Moslem guerrillas were not invited to the negotiations that produced the withdrawal settlement. The accord was signed by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghairad </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are not `` the real parties to this war.'' The Afghan rebels say the conflict is with the Soviets and not the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, which they consider a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> puppet. The guerrillas say no agreement is valid without their participation. The seven-party guerrilla alliance did not issue a statement after the signing Thursday, but said a resolution would be read Saturday at a public rally outside <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, the Pakistani border city that serves as its headquarters. The statement is expected to repeat the guerrillas' position that they will continue fighting until the last Soviet soldier leaves Afghan soil. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement calls for the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops who began arriving in 1979 to begin leaving May 15 and be out within nine months. <PERSON> Ghairad </PERSON> said: `` We will wait and see if there is entire peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the Communists are no longer in power.'' He said his family of five will not return home until he feels it is safe there, and predicted the 5 million other Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would do the same. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees representative in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, said it was too early to prepare for a return home by the refugees. Countries in both the East and West hailed the troop withdrawal accord as a vital first step toward peace, and some offered to help Afghan refugees. But skepticism remained over some aspects of the agreement, particularly continued aid to combatants. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, an independent English-language daily, said in an editorial titled `` Meaningless Agreement'': `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be able to withdraw its troops without having to acknowledge the plain fact that it has failed to pacify <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the face of resistance by U.S.-backed mujahedeen -LRB- guerrillas -RRB-. But on the face of it, the agreement will be pretty meaningless otherwise. `` For it will stipulate that the Americans and the Russians will continue to be entitled to provide arms to their respective clients. And while <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will formally agree not to interfere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, it will in reality continue to do so inasmuch as it will still serve as a conduit for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms supplies to the mujahedeen.''

<HEAD>Early Results Show 0.3 Percent of Hospital Patients AIDS-Infected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three patients in 1,000 were infected with the AIDS virus, according to anonymous blood tests at four Midwestern hospitals, but researchers say that rate of infection does n't necessarily apply to the nation The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, attempting to gauge the prevalence of AIDS infection of the virus that causes AIDS, tested blind blood samples from non-AIDS patients at 40 `` sentinel'' hospitals in 30 cities. In results from the first four hospitals enrolled in the program, all in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 0.3 percent of the 12,000 tested patients showed signs of AIDS virus infection, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in a report made public Thursday. The early data, however, may not be representative of the nation, said Dr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, a CDC AIDS researcher. `` You ca n't do a national estimate based on four spots,'' he said. Federal health officials continue to estimate that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans are infected with AIDS virus. `` No new data have become available to prompt a change of this estimate,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, adding, `` accurate estimates of the prevalence ... of -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- infection in the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population are not possible at this time.'' The agency expects to enroll all 40 hospitals in its testing program by September. If 1.5 million of the nation's estimated 240 million population were infected, the rate would be about 0.6 percent, about twice as high as the early <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> results. One million Americans would be about 0.4 percent. The four hospitals reported that antibodies indicating AIDS infection were more common among adults 25 to 44. Rates also were higher for blacks and Hispanics than for whites, and higher for men than for women, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Those rates are comparable to national AIDS statistics, <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> noted, adding, `` The data look right.'' As of this week, 59,287 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome itself have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. The disease has so far killed 33,060, or 56 percent of those patients. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s report summarized the agency quarterly presentation on AIDS to the Domestic Policy Council last month. The report also reviewed tests among prisoners and among childbearing women. Out of 29,193 federal inmates tested by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> since last June, 843, or 2.9 percent, have tested positive for AIDS virus infection. That is little changed from a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement last fall, when 3 percent of the first inmates tested were positive. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to contract with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and with a `` major university'' for AIDS testing of 10,000 inmates at 10 state prisons beginning this June. In 52,326 tests of childbearing women in the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, researchers found an AIDS virus infection rate of 0.8 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one woman in 61 showed antibodies against the AIDS virus, and 40 percent of those women passed the infections on to their newborn children, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> added.

 <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had pleaded for his life and even escaped once from death row, but in the end he walked wide-eyed and silent to his death in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s electric chair for the 1980 killing of a librarian. Rebuffed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after his lawyers made a frantic plea, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>, 33, was administered two jolts of electricity late Thursday night and pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m. Outside the prison, about 50 opponents of capital punishment conducted a vigil and prayer service. They were interrupted by a single supporter of the death penalty who shouted, `` Pray for the woman that died.'' <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> had been on death row since 1981 for the robbery and strangling of <PERSON> Wilhemina </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> school librarian who lived in his apartment building. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> a stay to review evidence of childhood abuse that the condemned man said he suffered. Attorneys for <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> said he had suppressed memories of the abuse and thus was incompetent to help his trial lawyer in offering mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> on Thursday afternoon, prompting a hurried effort by <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s lawyers to stop the execution. The federal appeals court said that <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s case had been given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and that his sentencing had been found constitutional. On Thursday night, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused a stay in a 7-2 decision, with Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissenting, and Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> turned down a petition for clemency. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was visited by his mother, sister, two aunts and his lawyers as the execution hour approached, said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, the prison's operations officer. He also was visited by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the 1960s child television star of `` <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> the Menace.'' North has been working on a movie about the 1984 escape of <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> and five other <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> death row inmates. `` We became extremely close friends,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who opposes the death penalty. `` We've been in contant communication, wrote and called. We became like brothers.'' Witnesses to the execution said <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was wide-eyed and impassive and appeared only a little nervous as he was led into the death chamber. In an interview Monday with the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> complained about pressure being exerted by the state to have him executed at the scheduled time. `` Why kill me today and be wrong in just a few months later?'' he said. `` What is the urgency? Why such an urgency to take such a life.'' In May 1984, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He was recaptured the next day at a coin laundry in <LOCATION> Warrenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bran Provides Low-Cost Alternative for Treating High Cholesterol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People on low-cholesterol diets can reduce their blood-cholesterol level by eating oat-bran daily instead of taking drugs which can cost three to six times as much, researchers say. But hold the milk. `` The oat bran is not as effective as some of the pharmaceutical products -LRB- in lowering -RRB- cholesterol, but it's effective,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, one of two authors of a study published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Adding a bran muffin or bowl of oat-bran cereal to a daily diet can cost about $ 250 a year, compared with some cholesterol-lowering drugs which can cost as much as $ 1,450 a year, he said. The daily consumption of oat bran or other water-soluble fibers has the positive effect in people who maintain low-cholesterol diets, <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Researchers concluded that each 1 percent reduction in the cholesterol level translated into a 2 percent reduction in the risk of coronary problems, such as heart attacks. <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinosian </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> performed a cost-benefit analysis of three treatments _ oat bran and the drugs cholestyramine resin and colestipol _ being used for a clinical trial on 1,900 middle-aged men with elevated cholesterol levels. The subjects had previously changed their diets to lower cholesterol intake. Daily consumption of oat bran or other water-soluble fibers have been shown to reduce the level of cholesterol by 13 percent to 19 percent, the range of most medications, <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said. A few drugs lower cholesterol as much as 25 percent, he said. Not all kinds of bran would work to lower cholesterol because many, such as wheat bran, are not water soluble, <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said. Cholesterol, a form of fat contained in many foods, is deposited in artery linings. It can cause blockages and hardening of the arteries, restricting blood flow and increasing the likelihood of heart problems. For purposes of the trial, an elevated level was considered to be at least 260 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood serum. Over the seven-year trial, oat bran proved as effective as the two drugs in triggering cholesterol reductions _ but at a fraction of the cost, the analysis indicated. The maximum 19 percent reduction in cholesterol levels would lower the risk of coronary problems 38 percent. Including the cost of regular medical supervision, a one-year supply of cholestyramine taken daily was estimated at $ 1,442, colestipol at $ 879 and oat bran at $ 249. `` If a person needs a certain type of prescription, there is no way around that,'' <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said. `` But as it turns out, it's probably more cost-effective to start treating hypercholesterolemia with oat bran `` One note, though. If you use milk with the muffins or cereal, remember that you're adding some cholesterol,'' he said.

 After 40 years as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most successful playwrights, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says he's thinking about taking things a little easier. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 60, was just 31 when his first play, `` Come Blow Your Horn,'' opened on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Prior to that, he was a television reporter for 10 years. `` That's 40 years of writing,'' he said in a recent interview. `` I do n't anticipate grazing on a farm someplace, but this pace I do n't need anymore. `` Maybe I'll just write plays for regional theaters an not think about going to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Maybe I'll stop in a couple of years and just do watercolors. I do n't know. I ca n't think beyond these two plays. I only think in the present,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has had 22 plays on Broadway. The two plays that are currently occupying his thoughts are numbers 23 and 24. His 23rd Broadway production is `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>'s Women,'' which is already finished. The story of a writer and the ladies in his life is scheduled to open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next year. Number 24 is a farce he is rewriting called `` Rumors,'' scheduled to make its world premiere at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s Old Globe Theatre in September before becoming his 24th play for the Broadway stage. `` There's nothing safe in ` Rumors,''' he said. `` It's a farce _ a style of comedy I've never written before. It's the most complicated thing I've ever written ... I doubt if I'll ever do another farce, because it's exhausting.''

 As many as 25,000 migrant workers have arrived in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> more than a month before the strawberry crop is ready to pick, and thousands are without food or shelter, relief agencies say. Last year, there were n't enough workers to pick an early harvest of strawberries, and 20 percent of the state's crop rotted in the fields. Growers complained that Mexican pickers were confused over the Immigration Reform Act of 1986 and refused to cross the border. This year, social service agencies are stretching to help an estimated 18,000 to 25,000 early arrivals. `` Word got out that there were a lot of jobs and everybody was afraid there would be such a rush that when they showed up it would be too late,'' said <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who operates the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> emergency shelter in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said she often sees 50 or 60 people living in one room when they deliver food to migrant camps. `` We have people in the backyard in tents. We even have people staying in the camper of our pickup because there's no place else to go,'' she said. `` Everywhere you see that. They have no water, no facilities. Many come here to take baths.'' A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grower who asked not to be identified said many workers are asking farmers to sign papers saying they worked for them at least 90 days each year from 1984 to 1986, as required by the new law. `` A lot of them ca n't get legalized, but hope people will fill out the forms for them,'' he said. The illegal workers are `` just hoping and praying they wo n't get asked for papers, that farmers will be lenient toward them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` We bring it up to them all the time, and they say, ` It's just the chance we're taking.''' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the law allows special agricultural workers to enter the country this year if they pay a $ 185 application fee and promise to provide papers from former employers. The law offers amnesty to illegal aliens who have been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since before 1982. The amnesty application deadline is May 4, a date that has confused some migrants, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grower said. Some workers arrived early because they believed they could not cross the border next month. `` Right now the -LRB- strawberry -RRB- crop looks very good, but it's still too early to say,'' said the grower, who is providing hoeing work for 15 to 20 people `` I think everyone in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> now understands how the rules work. ... They say they're going to stay here: ` We're going to wait for the work.' I think they all realize that this is the last opportunity to harvest in the Northwest.''

 Arab hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet overlooked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> driver's license of an Egyptian-American, who said he feared being harmed if his captors knew of his American citizenship. On Thursday, more than 2,000 Kuwaitis attended the funeral of two countrymen killed by the hijackers. Many of the mourners said their country should never give in to the sky pirates' demands that 17 convicted terrorists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> be released. <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a consulting engineer who travels widely and holds both Egyptian and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizenship, said he hid his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport in his briefcase and showed only his Egyptian documents. `` One of them searched my wallet, and there was my -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- driver's license,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said during an interview at the home of a relative in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` I was so lucky. He did n't realize what it was.'' He declined to give his American address because `` these guys, they have long hands.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> was one of 12 passengers freed Tuesday night shortly before the hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 flew from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> with more than 30 passengers and crew still aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane was seized April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, who displayed bruises on his wrists, said the hijackers put plastic handcuffs on the passengers while the plane was in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where it first landed last week. His eight days as a hostage left him nervous, emotionally stunned and wary of flying, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. `` It became to me like a phobia,'' he said. `` It could happen again.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said the hijackers asked the branch of Islam he belonged to: Sunni or Shiite. All of Kuwaitis released so far have been Shiites, members of the branch that predominates in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but is a minority in the Islamic world. `` I was reading the Koran all the time. They noticed I'm a religious person,'' he said, speculating that might have helped his release. On Thursday, a military honor guard escorted the flag-draped bodies of <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyub </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibib </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khalidi </PERSON>, 24, into a graveyard in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The two men were beaten, shot and their bodies dumped on the tarmac at the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> airport, where the plane sat for five days. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s crown prince, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, led the procession of mourners along a condolence line of more than 60 male relatives of the slain men. `` Even if they kill all the hostages there on the plane, we'll never, ever release the killers who are here in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>,'' said one mourner, <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Marzouk </PERSON>, chief editor of <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Like him, many of the mourners supported <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s refusal to free the 17 pro-Iranian terrorists who were convicted in a series of bombings in December 1983 at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Fall In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and stock prices closed the week sharply lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today following the announcement of worse-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February. The dollar closed at 124.13 yen, down 2.02 yen from its close on Thursday, but up slightly from its 123.95-yen opening level. During the day, it ranged between 123.90 and 124.22 yen in moderate trading. Dealers attributed the dollar's fall to the $ 13.8 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in February, announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` The larger-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit prompted the dollar-selling in early trading, but the currency stabilized after reports of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and due to profit-taking by export-related industries,'' said a trader at a major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Kazuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Takasugi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar had remained fairly stable during the day because participants were nervous about possible additional intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which closed at a record 27,111.35 points Thursday, lost 217.78 points to end the day at 26,893.57. The decline came after four consecutive days of record highs for the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index. `` The overnight setback on Wall Street and the weaker dollar, coupled with profit taking, brought share prices sharply lower during early trading,'' said <PERSON> Taketomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securites </ORGANIZATION>. `` Toward the end of trading, share prices eased mainly because of a wait-and-see attitude toward the dollar and the coming weekend,'' he said. <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> said trading was calm, with no concern among participants that the market had risen too far. Among the losers were export-related issues, such as electricals and precision machineries. Some large-capital issues also moved lower. Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 1 billion shares, down from 1.2 billion shares Thursday. Declining issues outpaced advancers by 674 to 260, while 127 were unchanged.

 A 5-pound, 1 -LCB- - ounce South American toad recognized as the world's largest has died apparently of old age, but zoo officials said they're not sure just how old she was `` She was not obese, just a very healthy specimen,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Thursday of Toad A, known as `` Toad'' to her keepers.

The show, which opened Thursday at the Music Box Theater, examines the anxieties of a sensitive, 29-year-old, would-be novelist named <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> who is having a mid-life crisis 10 years too soon. Not exactly a novel idea for a musical, but for much of the time, the evening is fun in an obvious, good-natured sort of way. Seekers of <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> significance and solemnity should look elsewhere. The problem with `` Mail'' is that the production relies on a gimmick to keep the story going, and that gimmick falters during the second act, no matter how busy director <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiff </PERSON> keeps his actors and set designers. The hook, created by author <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Colker </PERSON>, is simple. An angst-ridden <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> -RRB- disappears for four months, and when he returns to his dingy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment, there is a pile of mail to open. When he does, the letters leap to life. So does the complicated set, designed by <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Baral </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>'s letter writers jump out from behind doors, walls and windows and pop out of the desk and bathtub. One even makes an entrance through the refrigerator. There's his bewildered girlfriend <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, dumped just when she and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> were going to get married, and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>'s best friend, an idealist turned entrepreneur. Other correspondents include <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>'s gruff, obnoxious father who wants his son to come back to the carburetor business in <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and the writer's vixenish literary agent who wants to get her client into bed before she gets him on the best-seller list. Their increasingly frantic missives are interrupted by overdue bills, junk mail, high school reunion letters and even sweepstakes announcements that sing and dance. These interludes are among the best in the show. It's hard not to laugh when a contingent of <ORGANIZATION> Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> workers, dressed in hard hats, T-shirts and short pants, bully <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> in time to a disco ditty called `` We're Gon na Turn Off Your Juice.'' <PERSON> Colker </PERSON> also wrote the lyrics for `` Mail,'' and <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> supplied the music. With this large score _ nearly 30 numbers in all _ the duo makes good on the promise they demonstrated in `` 3 Guys Naked From the Waist Down,'' an off-beat contemporary musical about the world of stand-up comics. <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON>'s music for `` Mail'' is eclectic, ranging from pop to soul to ragtime to country-western. The songs have a brash Broadway sound, the result of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s first-rate orchestrations. At least one number, a lament by the rejected girlfriend entitled, `` It's Getting Harder to Love You,'' would seem to have potential for a life outside of the show. <PERSON> Colker </PERSON>'s amusing lyrics are more enticing than his slender story. The tale starts to evaporate at the beginning of Act 2 when <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> has a momentous revelation. He decides to see others as they see him. That decision forces the letter writers to recapitulate their feelings about our hero. It's only a matter of time before <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> neatly resolves his problems with each of them and with himself. Fortunately, the show has been blessed with a fine cast. <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> is a consumate, hard-working musical comedy performer and he makes <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> an ingratiating character we can care about. <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> <PERSON> Getz </PERSON> as the lovesick <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> possesses the show's best voice while <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the opportunistic best friend, struts and swings with style. Only <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandan </PERSON> as the insensitive father with problems of his own seems uncomfortable in the musical. The show always seems to be in motion, even when the story is n't. Most of the recent Broadway musicals move, but they do n't dance <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> has come up with some snappy if abbreviated dance routines recalling a style of musical comedy choreography that has gone out of fashion. `` Mail'' makes for a reasonably diverting entertainment, especially if you do n't think too hard about the well-worn message it delivers. In other reviews: <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> writes: `` This is a revue sketch idea that might have been amusing for 12 minutes. ... the music is as facile and vapid as the characters who sing it. ... `` But maybe someone should point out to young American writers that the world has many more appealing subjects than their not very interesting lives.'' In The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> asks: `` Is it possible that ` Mail' is a surreptitious advertisement for Federal Express?''

<TEXT>
 The Mexican government rejected as meddling in its domestic affairs a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote revoking President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s certification that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was doing its part to combat drug trafficking. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution Thursday that also would slap trade and economic aid sanctions against <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But the measure stands little chance of passage in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and is almost certain to be vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In a brief statement Thursday night, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action as `` foreign interference'' in <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> affairs. `` No power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples,'' the statement said. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would stand to lose American support in international lending institutions for new loans to the country if the resolution became binding. The federal attorney general's office, which is responsible for overseeing <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s narcotics efforts to find and destroy drugs, issued its own strongly-worded statement late Thursday night insisting that `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is undertaking a plain effort of international cooperation in the campaign against drug trafficking.'' It expressed `` profound astonishment and its great displeasure with the resolution taken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in that -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- does not recognize the enormous effort of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> people to combat a problem whose causes are not, certainly, attributable to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' The statement cited `` the vast consumer market'' for drugs, in a clear reference to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand, as sustaining the illicit narcotics trade. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> receives little economic aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But officials here are concerned about a requirement under 1986 law that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives in multilateral lending institutions must vote against future loans to countries whose certification is revoked. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has a $ 105 billion foreign debt, and depends heavily on its relationship with foreign lenders. Officials point out that about one-quarter of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 100,000-member armed forces is permanently assigned to narcotics interdiction and eradication operations Mexican officials also have insisted they could use more financial assistance from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in fighting drugs. As recently as 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug assistance to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was about half that provided for eliminating the screwworm in Mexican cattle. More than 100 army troops and federal judicial policemen have been killed over the past 10 years during drug operations, according to Mexican army figures. Relations between the two countries have been soured by mutual accusations surrounding the Feb. 7, 1985 kidnapping of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. The bodies of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, a Mexican pilot who worked with him in anti-narcotics programs from their base in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, were found on March 5, 1985. American officials charged that Mexican authorities were slow in seeking out and arresting several drug barons who allegedly ordered the killings. Attorney General <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> has called for an end to mutual recriminations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over their contributions to the fight against the drug trade. `` We find it difficult to accept the opinion held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of what really goes on in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. `` The border is not a border between black and white, good and evil. It is a border between countries.''

<HEAD>Late Porn Star Confessed To Role In Slayings, Ex-Wife Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Pornographic film star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> tearfully confessed to a role in the bludgeoning deaths of four people, charges he was acquitted of in 1982, his ex-wife said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who died last month of complications stemming from AIDS, told his ex-wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, that he led three killers to a hillside home and stood by while they murdered four people, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday's editions. Ms. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who divorced the actor in 1984, said in a recent interview with the newspaper that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> confessed his role to her shortly after the slayings in July 1981. However, he said he did n't participate in the murders and never told her the names of the killers, she said. Another woman who had a longtime intimate relationship with <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and asked not to be identified said he made a similar admission to her, the newspaper said. She reported that admission to police in 1981. Together, the women's stories corroborate the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s theory of how the killings happened. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who died March 13 at age 43, was tried and acquitted in a 1982 trial. No one but <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> has ever been charged in the murder of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Launius </PERSON>, 37; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVerell </PERSON>, 42; <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 46; and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 22. The actor appeared in hundreds of sexually explicit films in the 1970s and early'80s, when he was the porn industry's leading male star.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made her last appearance as first lady before an anti-drug group's conference, telling students, youth leaders and teachers she will be with them `` in spirit'' after her husband leaves office in January. `` These past eight years of work against drugs have brought new meaning to my life, and I will not abandon what we are accomplishing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday in remarks to the PRIDE International Conference on Youth and Drugs. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, making her fifth annual appearence, drew frequent cheers from the crowd of 3,000 amid a pep-rally atmosphere.

The first lady told the young people that they pose `` a threat to the dealers and the traffickers ... a danger to the drug attitudes that have ruled this country for the past two decades.'' `` It's the young people who will solve the drug crisis in this country,'' she said. `` We could have parents following their children's every move. We could have drug agents on every corner, treatment centers on every block, jails in every neighborhood, and still there would be a demand for drugs. `` What will win the battle against drugs is a change in attitudes, and that's exactly what you're accomplishing,'' she said. `` While I wo n't be able to come here every year as I have in the past, I'll be with you in spirit.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> also spoke to the group Thursday.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Sanctions on Mexico for Drug War Failings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Moves penultimate graf pvs, bgng: ``Under a ...'' up to 5th
graf to raise description of sanctions.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

 Senators voted overwhelmingly to impose aid sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for its shortcomings in the war on drugs, ignoring warnings that the move would damage relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' third-largest trading partner. `` This may be just the signal <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> needs to wake up before it is too late,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a leader of the effort to slap penalties on drug-producing and transit countries that fall short in their enforcement efforts. But in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> released a statement condemning the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote as `` foreign interference.'' In voting 63-27 Thursday for the sanctions, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ignored vehement Mexican objections and a plea from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had certified six weeks ago that the government there was `` fully cooperating'' with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war on drugs and should receive all its normal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and trade benefits. Under a 1986 anti-drug law, countries identified as production or transit points for illegal drugs must lose half their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid and certain trade and lending rights unless the president certifies that they are `` fully cooperating'' with the war on drugs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders, warned that the impact of the decertification bill `` would almost certainly be an increase in the flow of drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' because it would insult <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and make the government less inclined to cooperate. In separate action, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 54-40 not to impose similar sanctions on the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, and approved a resolution adding <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to the list of international drug producing and shipment points that are subject to close scrutiny and possible aid sanctions if their drug enforcement programs do n't measure up. Legislation to slap aid sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and four other Latin American countries also is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which would have to approve the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> resolution before it could become law. Even supporters of the bill conceded the measure has little likelihood of clearing all the hurdles, but said the symbolic value of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was enough. `` It's all rather academic,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., the bill's primary sponsor `` But by adopting this resolution, we will be sending a message to the government of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' The Mexican government said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no business sending that kind of a message. `` No power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. However, Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said close to 40 percent of the cocaine that enters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, making the 1,900-mile border between the two countries the No 1 entry point for narcotics. `` We've got to take off the gloves,'' he said. Despite the remoteness of chances any real sanctions could be enacted, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> fought hard against the measure and was threatening privately to kick <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement personnel out of the country and tackle enforcement without outside help. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides familiar with the issue said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> feared that any no-confidence vote from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could erode its world standing and potentially harm the willingness of international business to invest in the cash-starved country. To complaints that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would be offended by the bill, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said: `` It's about time we told them they should be offended, because we're offended.'' Citing increased drug-related violence in his home state, he added, `` It's not about business as usual at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' But during a five-hour <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor debate, opponents suggested that lawmakers were pushing for the sanctions at least in part because of election-year pressure to strike a blow against drug trafficking. Noting the comments of <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> itself falls short of the standards they seek to apply to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said `` marijuana is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s largest cash crop'' and said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> streets are unsafe because of drug-related crime. `` I wonder if we should n't decertify those states'' and cut off federal aid, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> asked. Of particular concern to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was a requirement that if certification is lost, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives to international development banks must vote against future loans to the affected country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a weighted vote at the banks, but not a majority. Loans from the banks have been crucial to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which is laboring under a mammoth foreign debt.

<HEAD>Deposed Governor Could Be Delegate to GOP Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says his political career is n't necessarily over and that he could become a delegate to the Republican National Convention in August. The former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor, removed from office by impeachment conviction on April 4, will be on the ballot in the first step of the delegate-selection process in his district caucus on Wednesday. Asked Thursday if he planned to seek a spot as a GOP convention delegate, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, `` Oh yes,'' but he did not elaborate. There have been reports that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would seek to become a delegate for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has put his campaign on hold. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> -RRB- is a bona fide precinct committeeman'' and thus is among 175 people who will be on the ballot when his legislative district chooses 38 delegates and 38 alternates to the state Republican convention on May 14, said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s district <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>. The state Republican convention will choose the delegates to the national convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15-18. Other delegates will be chosen at state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mini-caucuses. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 5-4 on Thursday to approve a bill to create a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. One of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s first acts in office was to rescind a King holiday declared by his Democratic predecessor, Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, and the resulting uproar dogged <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> through his short term. The latest King holiday bill was virtually identical to the one the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated along a party line last year. Republicans, who control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 19-11, will consider the measure next week in caucus.

<HEAD>Filmmakers: Movie Doesn't Glorify Gang Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The movie `` Colors'' opens today in 425 theaters across the country amid protests by the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> and others who claim the street-gang drama will incite violence. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, the film's director, called the protesters `` irresponsible'' and said they were encouraging `` blood to flow in the streets.'' The movie stars <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> as gang-fighting <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policemen. The movie, which used active Los Angeles-area gang members as extras and advisers, portrays the world of the Crips and the Bloods, rival gangs, who use the colors blue and red, respectively, to distinguish themselves. Some theaters planned to increase security today as the film opened. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, police Supt. <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said extra police might be assigned to patrol near theaters where `` Colors'' is playing. He said the film might send a message that there is `` something clever and hip about being a gang member.'' Six Guardian Angels including <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>, the founder of the volunteer crime-fighting group, were arrested Thursday on charges of disorderly conduct when they tried to enter the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> office of the film's distributor, <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. `` The movie ... glorifies street crack youth gangs,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> declared during a rally in front of the midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building. The group had announced plans to `` take over'' the office. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said the film provides a virtual `` how-to'' of street violence, including the killing of a police officer, and fosters negative stereotypes by depicting minority youths as violent toughs. But <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said the protesters `` are whipping up the probability and the possibility'' of violence. `` The people who are saying blood is going to flow in the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, said the movie is a statement of conscience and could `` shock'' children into avoiding drugs and violence. `` If there is anything this picture does not do _ it does not glorify gangs or gang violence,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. `` We feel that ` Colors' is an honest and socially responsible portrayal of a problem that obviously exists in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and in the streets of every other American city.'' However, <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said `` Colors'' will `` leave dead bodies from one end of this town to the other.'' In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, the local <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> group threatened to seek a court injunction if <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> theaters show `` Colors'' and said a protest would begin tonight at the UA Cinema 150 in downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` Each one of us was horrified by what we saw on the screen,'' said <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, Guardian Angels chapter leader, after she and others previewed the movie Wednesday night. `` The movie as we saw it was a simple recruitment for gang members.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was mostly lower in thin late-morning European trading today, even though apprehension about possible central bank intervention was supporting the currency, traders said. Gold prices rose. Traders predicted little substantial change in the dollar before the weekend, but warned that the dollar could come under heavy pressure early next week. Dealers said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> February trade deficit of $ 13.83 billion, announced Thursday, had confirmed many traders' worst suspicions about the long-term trend of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance. The markets had expected January's $ 12.44 billion deficit to improve. `` The only thing that will really cure the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap is a recession and I do n't see that happening in election year,'' said a trader with a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. Another Milan trader predicted the dollar will face heavy selling pressure when the markets open on Monday. `` Traders had a busy day yesterday and are waiting for the weekend,'' he said. `` The real war will begin on Monday.''

<TEXT>
 A 37-year-old dairy farmer was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder in connection with the slayings of seven members of his family, a rampage he at first blamed on a 14-year-old victim. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> of <PERSON> Elkland </PERSON> wept with his face buried in his hands when the verdicts were read early Thursday night. The jury deliberated about two hours after hearing 2 -LCB- days of testimony. The jury was scheduled to return this morning to receive instructions for the sentencing phase of the trial. The jury must recommend either the death penalty or life in prison without probation or parole. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> was convicted in the deaths of his wife, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, and two nephews, 14-year-old <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> and 2-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>. He also was accused, but not tried, in the deaths of his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>; <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON>, and the Buckners' other sons, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON>, 6. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> were brother and sister. <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON>, the mother of Mrs. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, said one question remained unanswered for her. `` I just wanted to know why he did it,'' she said. `` I think it was cold-blooded.'' All the victims were killed Sept. 25 in an early-morning shooting spree at two dairy farms in nearby <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION>. Schnick originally blamed the slayings on his nephew <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, a revelation that shocked members of the community who knew the teen-ager. Within days, however, <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> himself was charged in connection with the seven deaths. Investigators discovered, among other inconsistencies, that <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> was left-handed.

<HEAD>Highest Court Turns Down ``Birmingham Six'' Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six Irishmen serving life sentences for the worst terrorist attack in modern British history failed to win permission to appeal their convictions before <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest court. The defendants, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, claimed they were beaten into confessing and were wrongly convicted on faulty forensic evidence for two <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pub bombings that killed 21 people and injured 162 in the central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in 1974. The three Law Lords of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, members of the unelected upper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges, rejected the men's bid to challenge their murder convictions Thursday. They did not give reasons for their decision. The men's only option now would be to take their case to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. `` At some stage a future Home Secretary is going to have to deal with the ongoing injustice to these men,'' said <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a lawyer for the six. The Home Secretary is the Cabinet minister responsible for the administration of law and order. `` They simply ca n't spend the rest of their lives in prison when they have committed no offense,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. The men were not present at the 90-minute preliminary hearing at which the Law Lords were deciding whether to hear the case in full. In January, after a five-week court battle, the Court of Appeal upheld their convictions and sent them back to prison. The Irish government believes the six may have been convicted wrongly. The failure of the appeal in January contributed to a severe strain in Anglo-Irish relations. The bombs exploded minutes apart at two pubs in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> on Nov. 21, 1974. Within hours, the six were rounded up among dozens of suspects. Four signed confessions and two were said to have made verbal admissions. In 1975, a court imposed multiple life sentences on <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlkenny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>. Three of the men are in their 50s and three in their 40s. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, fighting British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility for the bombings but said none of the six was involved. The almost exclusively <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> wants to join the Protestant-dominated province and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.

<HEAD>Sandinista, Contra Commissions End Technical Talks, Report
Progress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sandinista and Contra commissions charged with defining <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s cease-fire finished talks early today with both sides reporting progress. High-level government and rebel leaders, meanwhile, planned to meet later today in the capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for the first time to further negotiations toward lasting peace. The Sandinista and Contra commissions, meeting in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on the Costa Rican border, said they achieved `` considerable progress'' and `` reconciled differences of the earlier meeting,'' according to an official statement issued by both sides. They remaining differences were not known, but both sides said they would take them up in the high-level meeting today. The two sides held six technical meetings since March 28 and managed only to agree on seven zones in which the Contra combatants are to gather. They failed to define operating conditions within the areas affecting security and resupply. The zones and the technical talks were outlined in the March 23 cease-fire pact signed by the Soviet-supplied <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the U.S.-backed Contras after three days of unprecedented direct negotiations at the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> border post, 90 miles south of the capital. The goal is to end more than six years of war that have killed more than 40,000 Nicaraguans. The commissions were defining the mechanics of the cease-fire, which formally went into effect April 1. Under the plan, the Contra evacuation into the zones was to have been completed by today. In return, the Sandinistas were to have released 700 political prisoners, allowed humanitarian aid for the rebels and permitted the insurgents to send representatives to take part in internal political discussions. Two points contained in a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> proposal had been termed `` non-negotiable'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. It would allow the combatants to receive replacements of arms and ammunition inside the zones while prohibiting the government from accepting military aid, which comes from the Soviet bloc. The cease-fire pact allows only humanitarian aid to be distributed by a neutral organization to the rebels. It does not mention government supplies. The Contra delegation was to be headed by its Miami-based directorate, made up of <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. The government's delegation is headed by the nation's highest military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Agreement is needed on a new deadline for the Contras to gather into zones and for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to make their concessions, such as the prisoner release. The pact now calls for a 60-day cease-fire, which ends June 1. The Sandinistas and Contras still stand far apart on the issue of laying down weapons, which is not mentioned in the cease-fire plan. They do agree the rebel combatants can enter the zones with their weapons. The Contras argue that they will never put down their arms until <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is `` on the irreversible road to democracy.'' The Sandinistas contend that disarmament must occur before reintegration into civilian life.

According to the spokesman, the blast left residents of at least 20 apartments homeless. The spokesman did not immediately say how many people lived in the building. Police said the explosion may have been touched off by construction work on a nearby subway system, and a local resident complained of smelling gas shortly before the blast occurred.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said international relief agencies it expelled were helping separatist rebels in the drought-stricken north and that its own government relief program could handle the crisis. But Western officials said the Soviet-backed government alone will not be able to feed the millions threatened with starvation. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would consult with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about urging <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to allow food aid to resume. Last week the Marxist government ordered the expulsion of all foreign aid workers from the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre and said the situation was too dangerous for foreign relief personnel. But an editorial by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, published on the front page of the Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies were aiding insurgents. The editorial accused unidentified relief agencies of committing `` serious crimes by transmitting false information to the world about the drought situation ... through sophisticated communication facilities which they had installed purportedly to ease relief operations.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is at the forefront of these, which have been directly or indirectly supporting separatist bandits,'' it said. Rebels in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> have been battling the government for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. In neighboring <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>, rebels have been fighting for 14 years. A special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy arrived in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> on Wednesday to discuss the expulsions with government officials. About 60 Western relief workers were ordered out of northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> last week. A spokesman for the Geneva-based organization, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>, refused comment. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> also refused immediate comment. It had been coordinating the huge northern relief operation that relies on food from Western donors. Western aid officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said they fear the government expelled relief workers to remove witnesses from the war zone as it prepares for a major offensive against the rebels. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the Marxist government of sacrificing the interests of millions of its citizens in pursuit of military objectives. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> denied the charge. An estimated 3.2 million people are facing starvation in the northern regions. Until peace comes, all relief operations must be handled by the government <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and other national organizations, the editorial said. `` Refusal to go along with such -LRB- an -RRB- arrangement is tantamount to interfering in our domestic affairs,'' it concluded. <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jembere </PERSON>, the chief Ethiopian relief official, has said Western aid workers would be allowed back in the north only when the area had been `` cleansed of bandits.'' The government says it will be able to feed most northern drought victims with help from Ethiopian organizations. But <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> said the war effort took priority over relief operations and that there could be a `` temporary stoppage'' of food distribution in areas outside government control. Rebels now control most of Tigre and much of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. Western relief officials say that at most 1 million people could be fed from government-held distribution sites. They fear mass migration of the hungry and have warned that deaths from starvation could begin within weeks.

Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said that the People's Republic is the sole legal government representing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It was not known whether the two spoke about trade issues. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has sought a reduction in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s surplus in trade between the two countries. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who was formally confirmed as premier at the just-concluded session of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, greeted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in English and said: `` Glad to meet you.

We hope more and more Philippine friends will visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported. The ancestors of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, like those of many Filipinos, came from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On her first day in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited the home of maternal great-grandfather in southern <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the warm reception she received in the village of <LOCATION> Hongjian </LOCATION> `` was a reflection of the friendly feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> accepted an invitation from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to visit the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. No date was set. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> presided over welcoming ceremonies earlier outside the hall.

She received a 21-gun salute from cannons on Tiananmen Square. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> spoke about <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Both Asian nations support the rebels in their 9-year-old war against Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, accompanied by two of her daughters, planned an afternoon visit to the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, home in the past to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> imperial family, and the Great Wall. Her three-day trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is her first abroad since November 1986, and was called risky by opposition leaders because of fears of a coup following the escape of renegade military officer <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who led an attempted takeover last August.

 A bomb exploded today at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radio relay station near a U.S.-Spanish air base east of the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> capital and caused slight damage but no injuries, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, said the bombing took place about 6 a.m. -LRB- midnight Thursday EDT -RRB- when a bomb planted near an air condition unit exploded at <LOCATION> Humosa </LOCATION>, a radio relay station about six miles east of the U.S.-Spanish air base at <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> is 12 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. No group immediately claimed responsibility, <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said, and police gave no indication of what group could have carried it out. The Spanish national news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> cited an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source as saying the bomb attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility could be related to the second anniversary of the April 15, 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the air attack on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in the bombing of a nightclub in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that killed two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and a Turkish woman. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said the explosion caused slight damage to a maintenance building near the fenced perimeter of the station, but did not interrupt <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> communications at <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION>, which the station supports. <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> air base has served as the site of numerous protest marches against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in recent years. In a March 1986 referendum called by the government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, Spaniards overwhelmingly voted to keep <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on condition Spanish armed forces remain outside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> command structure, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> be substantially reduced and that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> remain free of nuclear weapons. Last Jan. 15, after 18 months of tough negotiations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> demands to withdraw within three years a tactical wing of 72 F-16 fighter bombers from <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> to gain a new eight-year defense accord to replace a five-year pact set to expire May 14. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed services currently maintains three air bases and an important southern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> naval station as well as 10,000 troops in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 A man who won a court order to prevent his 18-year-old girlfriend from ending her pregnancy believes `` fanatics who hold abortion above the law'' persuaded her to have the operation anyway, his attorney says. The would-be father will not seek a contempt citation against the woman, but `` is concerned about the people who advised her. They acted lawlessly,'' attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Thursday. The woman's attorneys said she made the decision to have the abortion. <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said he might try to find out who performed the abortion and who advised the woman to have an abortion. Those people could be targeted for further legal action, he said. Meanwhile, the appeal of the injunction in the case was assigned Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> while the woman shunned publicity. `` She would just like to disappear,'' said Terre Haute attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who represents the unmarried woman identified in court documents as V.J.H. `` She's a very private person. She never imagined that she would have had this publicity,'' said <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON>. The woman's attorneys said they can not reveal when or where the abortion was performed, but they said no one coerced the woman to have an abortion. `` A whole lot went into her decision-making process, and those are considerations of the utmost personal nature that do n't have to be brought out in court or the media and she did n't,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The woman's attorneys announced on Wednesday that she had undergone an abortion despite the permanent injunction granted Monday in response to the request of a 24-year-old Terre Haute delivery-truck driver who claimed to be the father of the unborn child. Attorneys for both sides asked for an expedited appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, the justices rejected that request, noting that the case no longer is an emergency, and told the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to consider the issue. The case has n't yet been assigned to a three-judge panel in the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, according to that court's administrative office. Because the case involves a paternity action, the names of the man and the woman are not revealed in court documents. The woman's attorneys dispute the man's claim to be the father Attorneys for both sides argued that, despite the abortion, the case is n't moot. <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> said the injunction issued by <ORGANIZATION> Vigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` represents a fundamental assault on a women's right to privacy.'' `` If this order is allowed to go uncorrected, other judges might be tempted to do the same,'' he said. <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said he wants a higher court ruling on whether a father's rights should be weighed against the mother's in cases where an abortion is in dispute `` Unless we get this case on appeal and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upholds the father's right, we could have other cases of a father going to court and getting an injunction but the woman going ahead and getting an abortion,'' said <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>, who also represents the national Right to Life organization based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Troops raided a suburban house today and arrested 10 people, including eight navy guards who helped the leader of an August coup attempt escape his prison ship this month, the military said. Officials said troops had surrounded at least four other houses believed to be hideouts of followers of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a distinct possibility <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> might be in one of the houses. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led the bloody Aug. 28 coup attempt but escaped April 2 with 14 of his elite navy guards. The charismatic former lieutenant colonel had been detained on the navy ship since his arrest last December in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said three Marine companies and 30 police and soldiers carried out the raid one day after a tip that renegade troops were hiding in the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> district of suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The raid lasted only 15 minutes, he said, and there was no resistance. Raiders seized 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light machine gun, five Israeli-made Uzis, a grenade launcher and several grenades. Those arrested included Lt. <PERSON> Eraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojica </PERSON>, commander of the security force aboard the ship from which <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped. Two of those arrested were civilians, <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said. Col. <PERSON> Emiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Templo </PERSON>, chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said raids were continuing in hopes of capturing <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who has vowed to continue his struggle against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` There are other places to be raided,'' Templo said. `` Maybe, before the night is over, we will know if he -LRB- <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> -RRB- is here or not.'' The raid took place as the military was on full alert to prevent a new coup attempt while Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> paid a four-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. She left Thursday. Before the raids, the military announced the filing of the first mutiny charges against officers linked to <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s failed coup. Military spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabingan </PERSON> said those who have been formally charged before a court martial include two lieutenant colonels, a major and two lieutenants. Their arraignment has been scheduled for Monday, he added. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 others wounded during the coup attempt. Military lawyers said more charges were to be filed soon against more than 100 military officers and enlisted men jailed in connection with the coup attempt, the most serious of half a dozen bids to unseat Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she came to power in February 1986. Also today, police clashed with stone-throwing leftists near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and blocked a nearby march by militant Moslems protesting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> two years ago. Two demonstrators and one policeman were injured in the melee, the second near the embassy in two weeks. The clash broke out when club-swinging riot police charged a group of about 120 students who had arrived at a square fronting the embassy, witnesses said. They said three of the demonstrators who threw stones at police were arrested. At about the same time 100 yards away, police blocked a march by about 350 Filipino Moslems who were heading for the embassy on a march marking the second anniversary of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986. The Moslems dispersed peacefully after a brief rally at an intersection where they chanted anti-American slogans. They also burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags as well as an effigy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Leaflets distributed during the rally said the April 15, 1986, raids on the Libyan cities of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> unmasked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as `` 20th century barbarians.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombings came 10 days after a terrorist bomb killed two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and a Turkish woman and injured more than 200 people at a disco in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Libyan officials said 37 people were killed in the raids.

<HEAD>Graham Family Seeks More Control of Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> family is seeking a corporate charter change to tighten its control of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a move aimed at preventing any outside takeover. The proposal, to be voted on by stockholders May 12, is a reaction to efforts to take control of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producer <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The Post has two classes of stock, one controlled by the <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> family and the other traded publicly. The system was designed so that no takeover could occur without agreement of the family. However, the number of publicly traded shares is larger than the total owned by the family, so if the two types of stock were voted together, the <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> family shares would be a minority. No attempt to acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has been made, company officials said. However, <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is challenging a similar two-class stock system in the Media General case. So Post officials say they are proposing a charter amendment that will clearly state that any attempt to take over their company would have to have separate approval of a majority of each class of stock.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is willing to invite Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if he can be sure the invitation will be accepted, a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman said today. The statement came after the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> planned a visit to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> later this month. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, confirmed that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in late April. Speaking in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Thursday after signing accords on Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> expressed optimism on prospects for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiations modeled on the Afghan talks. `` The signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements certainly stimulates positive processes in the settlement of other regional issues, including the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. Although he declined to say if he would visit the region, the Soviet foreign minister seemed upbeat about the possibility of arranging talks. `` Fairly good prospects are now opening for a resolution of this most difficult problem,'' he said. Officials close to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would welcome a visit by <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, either by himself or in the company of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is reportedly considering a return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The prime minister would very much like to welcome the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign minister to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for discussions,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman. `` But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will not just throw out an invitation. He needs to know the foreign minister will come.'' Some observers saw the prime ministry's statement, which was also published in Israeli newspapers, as a trial balloon. A visit by <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would signify a major thaw in Israeli-Soviet relations. Diplomatic ties were severed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of Arab lands in 1967. The visit could also spur ahead the stagnant <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have said the Soviets must demonstrate a more balanced approach in the region if they want to play a role in the peace process. Among conditions <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has set for Soviet participation in peace talks are a resumption of diplomatic ties and freer emigration for about 380,000 Jews <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says want to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Aides to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said a Shevardnadze visit would not be linked to those conditions. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> supports the idea of an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, a key element of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s recent peace initiative. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> have disagreed on the authority that forum would wield. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> envisions a conference as a ceremonial opening to direct talks, whereas the Soviets have visualized an ongoing conference actively involved in decision-making. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, sharply opposes an international conference, fearing it would be hostile to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and lead to territorial concessions. His coalition rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has advocated the conference as a launching pad for direct talks.

 Extra units of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers patrolled the occupied territories today on the Moslem Sabbath, one of the calmest in more than four months of anti-occupation violence. The army clamped a curfew on the Palestinian refugee camp of Shati in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and curfews remained in effect in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> camps of <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jelazoun </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Amari </LOCATION>. No violent disturbances were reported. Near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, the site of a clash 10 days ago between teen-aged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hikers and Arab villagers in which a 15-year-old Israeli girl was killed, dozens of Jewish settlers held their own hike to show they would still circulate in the area. The hike ended without violence, but settlers complained about a heavy army presence, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said. A spokesman for the civil adminstration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said teachers in the territories had been given a three-week mandatory holiday with half pay, pending an army decision May 8 whether to reopen schools. Schools have been closed since early February in an effort to thwart student protests. Also Friday, military panels began hearing the appeals of five out of 12 Palestinians ordered deported this week on charges of inciting recent unrest. On Thursday, Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinians after demonstrators pelted them with rocks and cinder blocks. Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Among them was a 12-year-old boy who lost an eye. The deaths brought to 146 the number of Arabs killed since the unrest broke out Dec. 8. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a 15-year-old Jewish settler also have died. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, the army's chief of staff, said the number and scope of Arab protests in the occupied lands is declining, so that when soldiers fire on rioters those hit are usually ringleaders. A general strike called Thursday to protest the arrest of nearly 5,000 Palestinians since December brought commerce to a virtual standstill in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said Arabs were tiring after 18 weeks of violence in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said protests now involve only <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, `` so when soldiers are forced to fire, they usually hit the inciters themselves.'' `` Many people are simply not going out or do n't have enough motivation to keep it up with the same energy,'' <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said. `` You see it in the field.'' The most serious clash Thursday occurred in the narrow streets of the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> central market, where shops were shuttered because of the general strike. Hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said youths on rooftops threw stones and cinder blocks at soldiers, who opened fire and killed two Palestinians. The army confirmed the deaths but said it was investigating the circumstances. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said two other Arabs were shot and wounded. In another clash in nearby <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, a 12-year-old boy lost his right eye after being hit with a rubber bullet, an official at <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said. A 17-year-old Palestinian was shot in the stomach and listed in critical condition. Two Jewish children were slightly injured when the bus they were riding was stoned near the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Tekoa </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. It said an Israeli passenger bus also was stoned on the <LOCATION> Jerusalem-Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> highway near the Arab village of Abu Gosh. The vehicle's front windshield was smashed, but there were no injuries.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and took other steps to cut off the flow of dollars to <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> after he was charged with drug trafficking by the grand jury. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is running out of plans to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and is doing little to enlist the help of neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
 An 8 -LCB- - month-old Navajo girl, caught in a tug-of-war of cultures and laws, has been handed over to tribal authorities by the natural mother and the foster parents who cared for the infant since birth The baby, named <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristian </PERSON>, screamed `` Da Da'' Thursday and reached out for the only family she's ever known as she was taken away by an Indian social worker. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, the 21-year-old unmarried natural mother who wanted her baby to be adopted by <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also cried as she and the couple gave up custody of <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, her mother and Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> accompanied the social worker, an Indian attorney and the baby on the flight to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for a tribal court hearing. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> accused Navajo authorities of reneging on an agreement to take a later flight, when his family had reserved seats, and trying to leave shortly after the exchange. `` You lied to us,'' he yelled at <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillery </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Guillery </PERSON> said he made no promise about when the flight would leave, and told <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> he would be violating a court order if he did n't turn over the baby immediately. After the group arrived in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, the social worker and <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> officials got into a van with the baby and left, leaving <LOCATION> Keetso </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> behind. They had expected to fly with the baby to <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> before driving to the reservation. <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Diakun </PERSON> said the infant was in the tribe's custody and that the location would not be revealed. `` The Division of Social Welfare will make the appropriate placement until the court decides otherwise,'' Ms. <PERSON> Diakun </PERSON> said, adding that no date had been set for a hearing on the case at <ORGANIZATION> Tuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The Pittses have said they will continue to seek to adopt the hild. Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> had met the <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> couple through an adoption attorney who advertised in a newspaper on the reservation. The Pittses, both 33 and parents of an 8-year-old boy, brought Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> into their home when she was seven months pregnant. They gave her $ 200 a month for spending money, paid medical costs, coached her through labor and brought <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> home after her birth July 20, 1987. Despite the wishes of the natural mother, a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled earlier this week that <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> must be turned over to <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> authorities, pending a tribal decision on custody. Violet A.P. <PERSON> Lui </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said a custody hearing would be held soon. She said she did n't know whether <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> or the Pittses would be able to visit the baby. The Navajos, citing the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, filed a complaint in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court in February to gain jurisdiction of the case and stop the Pittses' adoption petition. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> legally resided on the reservation in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and was under the jurisdiction of Navajo authorities. Rather than appeal <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' ruling, the <PERSON> Pittses </PERSON> decided Wednesday to drop their adoption petition and pursue the case through the tribal court.

<HEAD>Faulty AIDS Diagnosis Causes Panic, Confusion in West Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A faulty test for AIDS led dozens of West Germans to believe they had the fatal disease, including a woman who planned her funeral, a newspaper reported. `` This woman lived with the death sentence for 56 days,'' the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Abendpost newspaper said Thursday. It said she wrote a final testament requesting a white casket with gold lettering for her burial. Her doctor later determined the test was faulty and she did n't have AIDS, the paper said Another woman was ready to poison herself because an AIDS test had indicated her husband carried the deadly virus, the newspaper said. Three days later the doctor said the diagnosis was wrong. On Tuesday, the <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> AIDS committee said up to 30 percent of AIDS test results in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are incorrect. `` There are rheumatism-related illnesses that, at first glance, react the same as AIDS antibodies,'' committee member and state parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> told reporters. The committee based its report on recent AIDS test results in a section of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state, where 528 of 11,824 patients tested as AIDS-positive. In a second round of testing to confirm results, only 359 of the 528 again tested positive, <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. About 500 West Germans a day are tested for the AIDS virus, the Abendpost newspaper said. The committee said it was shocked about the results and called for uniform procedures in testing and informing patients. Social workers Wednesday supported the committee's appeal. They also criticized doctors who prematurely or without psychological considerations inform patients they have the virus. `` It's pure terror. One can only do that if one wants to encourage suicide,'' <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zastrau </PERSON> of the Deutsche Aids-Hilfe -LRB- German AIDS Help -RRB- self-help group told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. The committee also said <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state should end its policy of testing civil service applicants, foreigners applying for asylum and young men in military service. <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state in 1987 introduced tough measures aimed at preventing the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, including mandatory testing of those groups. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 Ethical and legal questions are behind a decision to prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> from using tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses in genetic research, administration officials said today. The decision came last week in a letter from Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, assistant secretary of health at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>. `` This proposal raises a number of questions _ primarily ethical and legal _ that have not been satisfactorily addressed, either within the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> or within society,'' <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> wrote. His letter was in reponse to a proposal from <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> _ which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> _ to implant fetal tissue into patients with Parkinson's disease. PHS spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted today that <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>'s letter instructs <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> to appoint an outside advisory committee to examine the ethical, medical and legal implications of using tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses. He also pointed out that the prohibition does not ban research on tissue from fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths, but acknowledged that it generally is not feasible to use that tissue in the kind of genetic research the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> proposal contemplated. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> anticipates that the advisory committee he has instructed <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to form will move quickly _ perhaps within a couple of months _ to make recommendations. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> was out of town and could not be reached for elaboration. His decision was reported initially by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` The morality and science are all mixed together,'' the paper quoted <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> as saying. `` They need to be evaluated before we rush ahead. We just ca n't afford to move too hastily on this.'' Thousands of aborted fetuses are used each year in research on Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes and leukemia. Researchers say the special composition of fresh tissue that is obtained quickly from inducted abortions holds promise for treatment of the diseases. Researchers contacted by the Post expressed dismay at the decision. `` <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> sets the pace, and this will cripple fetal research in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON>, professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is an extraordinarily valuable research tool with immense potential. Depriving research scientists of this material is a great disservice to humanity,'' he said. Abortion opponents praised the decision. `` If the parents were a part to the killing, they have no right to assign organs to another person,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-to-life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is desecration of a corpse.'' Researchers told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, however, that proper planning is necessary to retrieve the tissue while it is useful and that it is rarely possible to use fetuses that have been aborted spontaneously.

<HEAD>British Comic Actor Kenneth Williams Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Comedian <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who starred in more than 20 of the farcical British `` Carry On'' movies, died suddenly at his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home today, his agent said. He was 62. Agent <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> did not reveal the cause of death. In addition to the boisterous and often risque `` Carry On'' movies, which poked fun at everyday British life, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was a star of British stage, television and radio. He developed a distinctive effeminate voice which became his trademark, and when he appeared on television his arching eyebrows, flaring nostrils and rolling eyes made him instantly recognizable. The 22 `` Carry On'' films he made, including `` Carry On Sergeant'' and `` Carry On Camping,'' were full of bottom-pinching and jokes about faulty plumbing. `` I like smutty old jokes,'' he once said. `` Honest vulgarity is the central tradition of English humor and uninhibitedness the essence of comedy.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> first discovered a gift for mimicry in school and carried on with it as a soldier, entertaining troops in World War II His first theatrical job was in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> while waiting to be let out of the armed forces after serving in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> was a wonderful character and his death will be a terrible loss to us all,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` He was an actor whose talents were never fully used. He developed a style all of his own. As a person he was a great raconteur who really sang for his supper.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a bachelor, once proclaimed he had `` never been in love'' and thought marriage was unnatural. He lived alone in an apartment next door to his mother, <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in his 1985 autobiography that he never wanted to play serious roles. `` Laughs are more important than tears,'' he said. `` There are plenty of people who can play serious roles ... but there are not many who can be funny.'' Of life in general he said: `` The shorter the better. I think to go at 65 or 70 is fine. Why hang about?''

 Four members of a family were found stabbed to death early today in a mobile home, and the bodies were so brutally mutilated that police did not recognize at first that one victim was a male. `` It resembles the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> thing. It's the worst I've seen in 28 years on the department,'' Sgt <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express-News </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. There are knives broken off in their necks,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Officers were searching for a man who was seen leaving the mobile home in a car belonging to one of the victims. Police first reported that four girls had been killed, but the mother of the victims later confirmed that one was a boy. The mother collapsed after identifying her children, police said. The killer used an entire set of kitchen steak knives, police said. Broken knife blades were scattered around the mobile home and some knives had been broken off and left in the bodies. `` It's a mess down there. A real mess,'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. A friend identified the victims as <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 19; <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 17; <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 13. A former neighbor, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, identified the parents as <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who are separated. Police Lt. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said three of the victims were nude. Officers were unable to determine immediately whether the victims had been sexually assaulted. An ambulance attendant who was inside the mobile home park told reporters the interior of the home looked like `` a slaughterhouse.'' Officers were called to the mobile home in the <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> Home Park at 3:27 a.m. by a person who said a girl was fighting with her boyfriend, <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said. When police arrived at 3:55 a.m., <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said, officers found the bodies. <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 20, said she had worked with <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> at a grocery store until they both resigned two months ago. Ms. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said the victim was shy. `` She would n't talk, but she asked me about married life and said she was wanting to move in with her boyfriend. They were always breaking up but she said she loved him. `` She said that he hit her and that he also broke into her other house but that she still wanted to marry,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. Officers said there were signs that at least some of the victims had struggled with their assailants. Others may have been killed in their sleep, officers said. Authorities said the telephone jacks had been ripped from the wall of the mobile home. Reporters were being kept about one-quarter mile away from the scene on the south side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. At one point, the father of the victims struck a television cameraman and had to be restrained from striking a second one, authorities said. Four officers restrained him. `` Get those cameras out of here. This is not a carnival! This is not a damn circus!'' the father said. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> was convicted of directing the murder of actress <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> and six other people in 1969. Four members of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>'s cult were convicted of commiting the murders.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> says he's continuing to receive weekly treatments for pancreatic cancer and will continue to fight the disease even though he's been told it's fatal. `` I have n't given up yet,'' the brother of former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` I still think I'm going to beat it, you know. I'm going to try everything. ... I'm going to my seventh treatment next week, and if he does n't do any good I'm going to another one, and then I'm going to try a voodoo doctor, you know, and a snake doctor. I'm going to fight it as long as I can.'' In the interview, conducted Thursday in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he and his brother have grown closer since both moved back to their south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> hometown. `` He lives right around the corner, and we've become extremely close since I found out -LRB- about the cancer -RRB-,'' he said. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> became known for his wise-cracking and beer-drinking during his brother's 1976 campaign, but quit drinking nine years ago after undergoing treatment at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> alcoholism center. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 51, was told by doctors last fall that he had inoperable pancreatic cancer, the same disease which killed his father and his sister. He has credited a new treatment involving injections of a compound containing platinum with prolonging his life beyond the short spans lived by his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, after they were stricken. He said his brother's election in 1976 completely changed his own life, propelling him from the simple life of a peanut farmer in Plains to the problems of national celebrity. `` I've been asked a thousand times, I guess, what would I do if I had to do it over again, and I said I'd probably do the same thing because if I had it to do over I'd probably screw it up worse,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. He said he was sorry for his drinking, but had no other regrets about his life.

 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> today marked the second anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and led foreign dignitaries on a tour of the ruins of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s former home. About 40 delegates to an international terrorism conference and a few journalists were ushered into the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader's two-story concrete house shortly before 2 a.m. to coincide with the time of the American raid on April 15, 1986. Libyan officials promised that the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader would make an appearance, but <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> did n't show up. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a man claiming to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigades </ORGANIZATION> claimed that the bombing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club Thursday was in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The bombing in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> killed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicewoman and four Italian civilians. Another bomb exploded today in at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radio relay station near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. There were no injuries. The Spanish national news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> cited an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source as saying the attack could be related to the Libyan anniversary. Also today, police clashed with stone-throwing protesters near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and blocked a nearby march by Moslems protesting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids. In downtown <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, all was quiet. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said 37 people, including <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s baby daughter, were killed in the American attack, which was in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in the bombing of a West German nightclub. That blast killed two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and a Turkish woman. `` Even if they were able to kill me on that day _ the day of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-NATO </ORGANIZATION> barbarous aggression _ even if they were able to do that in the future, that does not mean that they have succeeded in accomplishing what they wanted,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> as saying Wednesday during a speech to the terrorism conference. There was no explanation for <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s absence from today's tour Since the bombing, countless visitors to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have been taken to tour the house. Blown out windows have been covered with plastic sheeting. `` This is one of the two bedrooms where the children slept,'' a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> official said, pointing to an unlit room littered with glass. Several schoolbooks and notebooks, including a coloring book with pictures of animals, were strewn on one bed. Hotel gift shops sell postcards of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s adopted daughter <PERSON> Hana </PERSON>, who reportedly died in the raid. The interior walls, including those of two bedrooms, bear chalk inscriptions in Arabic that Libyan guides said were written by students visiting the house. They said the inscriptions praise <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and denounce President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers that participated in the raid took off from a base in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In front of the entrance hall, the Libyans have erected a 12-foot high tin hand with its fingers gripped around a splintered silver jet representing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers. Those on the tour included delegates from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told them that <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> nations should `` start the struggle to rid the waterway from the fleets of terrorism, from nuclear arms and from military exercises. `` He said he endorsed Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal to withdraw both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet fleets from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>

 Two hostages aboard a hijacked jumbo jet broadcast messages today saying they would be killed if the Kuwaiti government did not bend to the demands of the Arab gunmen holding the plane. About 30 passengers were reported being held in grim conditions, all handcuffed and forced to remain silent. About four crew members also are believed to be aboard the jet. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was hijacked April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> with 112 people aboard. It was forced to land at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where the hijackers freed 57 hostages. The plane then flew on to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where 13 people were released and two Kuwaitis were killed. It arrived in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Tuesday night. The hijackers are demanding that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 jailed pro-Iranian terrorists. Kuwaiti officials have refused. The two recorded messages, almost identical in wording, were sent by radio from the plane to the control tower at <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and my friends and I ask the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> authorities to free the 17 prisoners held in <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> prisons,'' said <PERSON> Soleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Soleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Mashari </PERSON>. `` In the event of refusal, they are going to kill us.'' In a second message, a man identifying himself as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ajem </PERSON> said: `` I am one of the hostages from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> ... and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the prisoners held in the prisons. Without that, the kidnappers have decided to kill us.'' A passenger made a similar plea Thursday. The hijackers released one of their captives Thursday during the second day of negotiations here with a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation through Algerian mediators. The freed hostage, <PERSON> Djuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, is a 70-year-old diabetic who doctors said urgently needed an insulin shot. The gunmen issued a statement saying they would not budge in their demand that the 17 prisoners be released. They said they stood by their demand `` even if the price we have to pay is very high.'' `` We are not highway bandits,'' they said in the statement, radioed to the control tower in Arabic and English. `` We are men of principle.'' According to a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> reported that the hostage worst affected was <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, 33, cousin of the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, regarded as the hijackers' most valuable captive. <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>'s two sisters also are on board. <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> was quoted as saying <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> suffered from a severe nervous disorder even before he boarded the plane, and the experience of the hijack `` seems to have put him over the brink.'' <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> had continuous violent shakes, could not speak and `` just cries all the time,'' he said. <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> said there were eight hijackers. Other freed passengers have said there were between five and eight. `` Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the time and I am tired,'' <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> told reporters in the airport lounge. `` They are not good people. They beat me.'' <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> was examined on board Thursday by an physician who told the hijackers the man would die unless freed. The Kuwaiti official quoted <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> as saying all hostages had their hands handcuffed behind their backs at all times and were not allowed to speak or move. The official said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> had deep, bleeding cuts on both wrists from the handcuffs he said he was forced to wear since the plane was in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>. The Kuwaiti official quoted <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> as saying four bombs made of stick explosives connected by wires were attached to the four doors in the plane's midsection. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, lawmakers on Thursday urged Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers might be responsible for kidnapping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was seized March 16, 1985 and is the longest-held of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine are Americans. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday that the alleged kidnapper, <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>, was believed to have boarded the plane when it landed in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> has been identified as one of the security chiefs in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding the hostages.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is investigating human rights issues in the remote mountain region, authorities said today. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state, is visiting several cities in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> with an officer from the American consulate in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The main reason he's going is to see the situation for himself,'' said press officer <PERSON> Andew </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koss </PERSON>. A report on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> regional radio said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubai </PERSON>, deputy secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The report said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> raised human rights questions, among other issues. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> told <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> that the `` leftist errors'' of the past, when Tibetan religion and customs were oppressed, had been rectified and defended <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s human rights record in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, the radio said. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has erupted in violence twice in the past six months, with <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks leading anti-Chinese, pro-independence riots last fall and again on March 5. The disturbances last September and October in the capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, which left an estimated 14 dead. They caused a rift in U.S.-Chinese relations, with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accusing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of human rights violations and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> charging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government backs <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s contention that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have expressed support for Tibetan spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who has been living in exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since 1959. After last fall's riots, <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> authorities closed the area to foreign journalists and diplomats and all but a few well-watched tourist groups. Since late February the restrictions on foreign visitors have been eased somewhat, although the March 5 riots, in which as many as 24 people were killed and hundreds arrested, prompted another clampdown on visits. Chinese officials continue to insist that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, which has promoted tourism as a major source of revenue, is open. But they say the region can handle only a limited number of people at any one time. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> leads the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government delegation to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> this spring, following a group led by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> is to return to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Sunday.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today filed a formal diplomatic protest with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over what it called `` violations of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s sovereignty'' by American troops. The note said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops closed a Panamanian highway during a two-hour firefight Tuesday night `` between soldiers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and an unknown group.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON> called the act a `` flagrant violation of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s sovereignty'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers who `` violated Panamanian territory in a visible form.'' The highway was closed for three hours Tuesday night, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said about 100 Marines exchanged fire with 40 to 50 uniformed intruders at a fuel dump near <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said it consulted with the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces before closing the highway for `` security reasons.'' The highway runs past the air base and connects the capital with the western part of the country. Copies of the protest note were sent to <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Marines scouring rugged jungle at a fuel depot have found no evidence to back sentrys' claims that uniformed intruders engaged them in a nighttime firefight, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military says. Still, and despite Panamanian ridicule, the Americans stood by their story. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> was accidentally shot to death by another <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night as they investigated what was described as a break-in by six to eight `` uniformed, camouflaged intruders'' at the depot. The next night, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said, about 100 Marines and 40 to 50 intruders `` wearing dark uniforms'' engaged in a two-hour firefight. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that it would take at least another day for soldiers to complete their inspection of the 807-acre <ORGANIZATION> Arraijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>. Asked if the Southern Command was still sticking to its accounts in the absence of concrete evidence, <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON> replied: `` Yes, sir, we are.'' On Thursday, state-run news media and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> heaped scorn on the American story. `` Marines Made Fools Of,'' a headline in red ink said in the morning tabloid <LOCATION> Critica </LOCATION>, which is controlled by the government. The story said the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> had shouted `` cries of fear, desperation and terror'' during the reported skirmishes. A cartoon showed a Marine smoking marijuana against a backdrop of swaying palms. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains about 10,000 troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a permanent force to defend the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. About 1,300 more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week to increase security for the canal and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens there. On Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman suggested Monday night's intrusion had been made by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, an assertion angrily denied by the Panamanian government In describing the Tuesday night incident, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> officials carefully avoided implicating the Panamanian military, saying the reported intruders could not be identified `` with any particular organization.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are headed by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the power behind <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration has been seeking his ouster for months. Last month, in an attempt to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began freezing Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, creating a cash shortage in the country.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> regents left their regular meeting under guard and went into closed session today for the second day in a row after they were disrupted by students protesting anti-discrimination policy. There were scuffles between security guards and some of the 30 protesters who attended the open meeting after the regents were led out, but no injuries were reported. At least three people were hurt during a similar confrontation Thursday, when protests also forced the regents into a closed meeting. Soon after the closed meeting began, the protesters left the administration building, shouting they would return with enough students to surround it, <ORGANIZATION> WAAM </ORGANIZATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Campus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, said the students wanted to let the regents know how angry they are about a proposed anti-discrimination policy and about being shut out of the meeting. The anti-discrimination policy was meant to counter racial and sexual harassment on campus. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Student Assembly and other opponents complain that interim president <PERSON> Robben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> drafted the policy without consulting students and that it targets student misconduct without addressing such action by the university and its administrators. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> `` has a history of neglecting student input, and now he's trying to throw this code down the students' throats,'' <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, a former co-chair of the student assembly's <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. Protesters also demanded the dismissals of <ORGANIZATION> Regent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literature </ORGANIZATION>, Sciences and Arts. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has offended students for years with his attitudes about minorities and homosexuals and his support for military research at the university. <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> has been under fire since January, when students obtained a copy of his remarks during a closed faculty meeting in September when he warned against lowering university standards to recruit more black students. He later apologized for phrasing of his remarks but denied they were racist. On Thursday, about 35 students protested during a public board of regents session and demanded the dismissal of <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> and two other top officials, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Owsley </PERSON>, the school's director of news and information. The regents adjourned and headed upstairs to a conference room to continue the meeting without spectators, <PERSON> Owsley </PERSON> said. The protesters followed them and tried to enter the room while security guards held them back, he said. At least two school officials and one protester were slightly injured, but none required hospital treatment.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Frigate Encountered Field with Numerous Mines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The guided-missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> encountered a mine field with numerous mines Thursday morning before its hull was ripped open by one of the underwater explosives, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The frigate had come to an almost complete stop in the water at the time of the explosion after successfully maneuvering away from several mines spotted by lookouts, the officials said. The effort to maneuver out of the mine field was hampered by rough seas, however, and the mine the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> eventually hit was probably moored to the bottom, the officials said. The defense officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, said at least two mines had been spotted today by a reconnaissance helicopter dispatched by other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the area. The sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> now had four mine-sweeping ships closing in on the patch of water in the central gulf where the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was hit to begin a search. `` Ideally, we'd like to recover one of these mines,'' said one source. `` But we also want to do it safely. The seas out there are still heavy. It may take a while. `` We might end up just blowing them -LRB- the mines -RRB- up. But we're pretty much convinced this is a new field that was just laid And we certainly suspect the Iranians are behind it.'' The sources also said today the frigate had suffered extensive damage. `` At one point, there was 12 feet of water inside the engine room,'' said one official. `` The crew just did a hell of a job. She -LRB- the ship -RRB- took a really bad hit.'' Ten sailors were injured _ two of them critically with second-degree burns _ when the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was ripped by the underwater explosion at 10:10 a.m. EDT. There were no fatalities. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had been decided to tow the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> as earlier announced, and a commercial tugboat, the <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, was now en route with it. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined to estimate when the ship might arrive. One source said that by towing the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could move the ship immediately into a dry dock there for repairs. While the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> uses <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> as a base for its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> forces, there are no large dry dock facilities on that island. The sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would not be able to tell the full extent of the damage or make any decisions about repairs until the ship was out of the water. `` We know the damage is bad, though,'' said one. `` They're towing her only at about five knots because they do n't think she can take any more.

<HEAD>BLM to Stop Giving Away Large Numbers of Wild Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> today said it would curtail its practice of giving away large numbers of wild horses. Though the bureau did not mention it in the announcement, it has previously admitted that instances of what appeared to be abuse of animals in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> might help end its no-fee `` adoptions.'' Since 1976, more than 86,000 horses have been removed from the range in the West and placed with private owners, and the bureau will continue to offer horses to individuals. The bureau charges $ 125 per horse, but has been waiving the charge for people willing to take 100 or more. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burford </PERSON>, director of the bureau, said in the announcement the bureau still would accept applications for waiver of the fee from non-profit groups working to improve the adoptability of wild horses. Young horses find ready takers, but older animals are harder to break and for that reason are in less demand. <PERSON> Burford </PERSON> said the bureau had `` great hopes for another concept being developed, that of privately funded wild horse sanctuaries,'' and also would step up its use of prison inmates to break horses.

 Police said today that a member of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group was the prime suspect in a car bomb explosion outside a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club that killed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicewoman and four Italians Investigators said they were searching for <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, 39, who is also suspected in rocket and bomb attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British embassies in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> last June. At least 17 people, including four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors, were hurt in the Thursday night blast outside the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> club in downtown <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> identified the slain sailor as 21-year-old <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a radioman 3rd class from <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. She had been stationed at the Naval Communications Area Major Station in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> since March 1985 A man called a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency office in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> today and claimed the attack in the name of a group calling itself the Organization of Jihad Brigades. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imperialists must die today, two years after their barbarous attack against the Libyan Arab state,'' the caller said in accented English. `` Jihad'' means `` holy war'' in Arabic. At 2 a.m. on April 15, 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bombed the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> capital in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in the bombing of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> nightclub. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and a Turkish woman died in the nightclub blast. The <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdulrahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shargam </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency that attempts to link <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to the bombing were disinformation. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s anti-terrorist police said investigators believed <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> had accomplices and that they were taking the claim seriously. `` We do not think that the attack was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> alone,'' said <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON>, who is leading the investigation. `` We think he was working with other terrorist groups which we are still trying to identify. `` <ORGANIZATION> Argenio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> is believed to have parked the rented car, laden with explosives, outside the club Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified police official as saying `` the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> connection seems most likely.'' State-run RAI television reported receiving a call today from a man who said `` Justice has been done for the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people.'' The blast damaged the club's interior, wrecked cars and shattered windows along narrow <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marco </LOCATION> street. The slain Italians included a souvenir vendor who regularly sat outside the club and three passers-by. The bomb, in a white car with <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> license plates, exploded at about 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said most of the sailors in the club were from the frigates USS Capodanno and USS Paul, which are anchored in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> from the USS <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was quoted in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattino </PERSON> newspaper as saying he saw a man with dark hair and olive skin, who `` did n't look like an Italian,'' put something inside the car and flee just before it exploded `` We were getting ready to lower the shutters when the world exploded around us. We heard desperate shouts. We ran out into the street,'' said <PERSON> Valaria </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinetti </PERSON>, 22, who works at a nearby store. `` God what a terrible scene. I saw three or for people transformed into torches who were crying for help,'' she added. `` I went back into the store to get a fire extinguisher. When I went back into the street they were already burned beyond recognition.'' One of the bodies was later drapped with an American flag. <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> was identified as having rented the car that blew up outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> last June. There were no injuries in either that attack of the one on the British Embassy. <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> is also suspected of involvement in attacks on Western embassie in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 1970s. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1976 on charges of possessing a false passport and deported to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but was freed in 1977 when hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> demanded his release. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> identified the wounded sailors as Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Navalta </PERSON>, 39; of <LOCATION> Castillejos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>; Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON>, 22, of <PERSON> Gaither </PERSON>, Md.; <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, 27, 3rd Class electronics technician, of <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and Senior Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said they were in stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Agnano </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, but he would not describe the injuries <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was treated and released.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and three other grim-faced diplomats who signed the Afghan accords studiously avoided the word `` peace'' to describe what they had achieved. The tragic reality behind what <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called a historic agreement is that the killing will go on in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, as it did in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for two years after <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> put his signature on a similar accord in 1973. Yes, the Soviets pledged to remove their 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, 1989. Yes, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and the signing ceremony in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> talking about worldwide efforts to help Afghan refugees return to villages no longer threatened by Soviet napalm and helicopter gunships. Yes, the agreement signed Thursday by the foreign ministers of the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opens the way for what <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called `` Afghan control over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' Although the Soviets have not stated their intentions publicly, the sad expectation is that that the Soviets will continue to arm the Afghan government they have backed for a decade and the Afghan mujahadeen supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue receiving weapons from a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> pipeline. Today, however, a high administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still hopes that the Soviets may elect to end shipments to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and let that long war wind down. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried to get the Soviets to agree to a mutual cutoff of weaponry, but that effort failed so it is likely the Afghan rivals will continue receiving the means to kill each others' adherents. The accords signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> do not end the war; they merely begin the end to Soviet troop participation in it. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged the agreement was `` not perfect.'' But he and officials who traveled with him to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were clearly satisfied with what had been accomplished. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its allies, the Islamic world and most of the rest of the world have been railing against the Soviets for more than eight years for sending troops to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. To bring that withdrawal about, after the loss of an estimated million Afghan lives, was a major victory, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, prompting him to proclaim, `` History has been made today.'' The agreement also will permit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to step back a bit from deep involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> affairs, the officials said. After all, before the Soviets turned <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into a superpower sore point, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had little interest in the incessant warfare within Afghan's tribal society. The Soviet decision to withdraw could lead to the restoration of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to that shelf of countries the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> need not worry about and the officials seemed pleased at that prospect. There was a touch of irony to the signing ceremony in that it took place in the same chamber where the superpowers blessed a 1955 <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> accord that eventually failed. The parallels between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the 1980s and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, particularly in the 1970s, are inescapable. A superpower bogged down in an unpopular war at home and abroad, realizing its superior firepower can not defeat a tenacious guerrilla force armed by another superpower, signs an agreement permitting disengagement `` with honor.'' In 1973, Secretary of State <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> set the stage in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> accords for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop withdrawal, turning the struggle over to the well-stocked South Vietnamese. By April 1975, the North Vietnamese had won. On Thursday, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who signed the troop withdrawal pledge, said supplies to the `` legitimate'' government of <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> would continue. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, sounding vaguely like the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials of the 1970s, tried to put the best face on what had happened. How will Soviet generals swallow their defeat, he was asked at a news conference? `` Soviet generals do n't think they lost the war,'' he replied. He feigned ignorance of a well-publicized Soviet academician's assertion that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s initial decision in 1979 to send in the troops was a mistake The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> went into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to help a besieged, legitimate government, he said. Behind the gloss, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said, was a clear Soviet determination to end its involvement _ a determination unthreatened by last-minute finagling over the continuation of superpower assistance. Asked if <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s condemnation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance for the rebels could unravel the agreement, one official laughed and declared: `` They are n't looking for a pretext to stay.'' The accepted wisdom at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government collapsing eventually because it has little support among Afghans. Yet there is no consensus in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on how soon that could happen. The most graceful transition to peace could come about through a further mediation effort by <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official who led the negotiations that resulted in Thursday's accord <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> has agreed to begin talks with the factions on creating an interim government to supplant the Marxist <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> regime. In the meantime, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his enemies, the mujahadeen, vow to continue the struggle and the killing will continue.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the guided-missile frigate that struck an underwater mine in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> was out of danger today. Two of the 10 seamen injured were in critical condition. The USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was being towed to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` The ship is under control. It is out of danger,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> declined to give the exact location of the ship. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired six missiles on <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> economic and military installations in the cities of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, Ali-gharbi and <PERSON> Khaneghein </PERSON>. There was no immediate confirmation from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> earlier reported that 13 civilians were killed and a number of others injured in overnight Iraqi bombing raids on the western Iranian cities of <LOCATION> Hamadan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said today that the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> encountered a mine field with numerous mines before its hull was ripped open by one of the underwater explosives. The frigate had come to an almost complete stop in the water at the time of the explosion after successfully maneuvering away from several mines spotted by lookouts, the officials said. The effort to maneuver out of the mine field was hampered by rough seas, however, and the mine the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> eventually hit was probably moored to the bottom, the officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the 3,700-ton <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was in no danger of sinking. The explosion occurred about 55 miles northeast of the <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> peninsula while the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was on patrol. Four of the injured seamen were taken to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s Salmaniya hospital. Head said two were suffering from second-degree burns over 40 percent of their bodies and were in critical condition. The third had second-degree burns over 15 percent of his body, while the fourth was suffering from lower-back problems and smoke inhalation. The other six injured sailors were under observation aboard the combat store ship <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Head said they were listed in good condition. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was sailing southward on a return trip from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> after escorting one of 11 U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was blamed for a spate of mine blasts in the gulf last year i spillovers of its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> are two of 14 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships assigned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force in the gulf to protect merchant vessels flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and left there for gulf duty on Jan. 11. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said about 225 men were aboard. Officials said the type of mine suspected of causing the explosion was not immediately known. The $ 400 million, 445-foot frigate was the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship hit in the gulf in the past 12 months. The frigate USS Stark, the same type of guided-missile frigate as the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, was hit by an Iraqi missile in the gulf last May. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> apologized for the attack, which killed 37 sailors, saying it mistook the Stark for an Iranian warship. The <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, a Kuwaiti tanker sailing under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, hit a mine near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in July 1987. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has six mine sweepers in the waterway but they have worked mainly in the northern gulf. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration increased the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force in the region last July in response to a request from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, whose oil tankers had been targeted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> identified seven of the 10 injured sailors as: Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Royston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; Petty Officers 3rd Class <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbine </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Ashaway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Paprocki </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>; Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Seamam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Clearfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Slocomb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>.

 A federal magistrate assigned a lawyer today to meet with a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> man who has refused to speak to officials trying to find out why he carried three powerful bombs in his car on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> said the lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, would explain to <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> the charges pending against him. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> then recessed a hearing, called to consider bail for <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Kikumura is being held on federal charges of possessing a fraudulent visa and illegally possessing unregistered firearms, the explosives. If convicted, he faces up to $ 260,000 in fines and up to 15 years in prison. In addition to the explosives, authorities revealed in court today that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was carrying $ 3,600. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, entered the country March 8 and was arrested by a state trooper Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Vince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lombardi </LOCATION> rest area in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION>, authorities said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been unable to confirm reports by the Japanese Foreign Ministry that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> is a suspected member of the terrorist group <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlinley </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office. Officials have yet to link Kikumura with any group and were exploring any international ties he might have, <PERSON> McGlinley </PERSON> said. `` We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to answer,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is suspected of involvement in a bombing which killed five people, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicewoman, in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, on Thursday. Italian police said a known member of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have rented the car that exploded outside an American military club. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> here, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knights </PERSON>, refused to comment on the Italian bombing and any connection to <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s activities `` We're not saying anything about that,'' he said today. `` We're not making any linkage between the two. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, who was identified by officials in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> through fingerprints, faced a bail hearing under heavy guard Thursday before Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGisi </PERSON>, who released him to federal agents without setting bail. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> told DiGisi he would not talk to federal authorities until a lawyer was appointed for him. Meanwhile, Japanese police refused to comment on <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reports <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was believed to have established links to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese terrorist group, in 1974 when he ran a bookshop in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The news service said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s arrest had raised suspicions the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> might be planning attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations June 19 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> advocates `` simultaneous world revolution'' and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. State Police Superintendent Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said a terrorist task force is investigating the case because of the sophisticated nature of the bombs, which police said were made from three 18-inch steel cylinders. Authorities said they found 15 pounds of black powder in the car. Federal officials estimated that the explosives in the car were capable of destroying the car and a `` substantial part of a normal dwelling.''

He was sentenced to 14 years in prison but was released on parole last year. He spent the last 10 months of his parole in a mobile home on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> after a statewide outcry in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> against allowing him to leave the prison. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KOIN-TV </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Thursday that he had spoken to <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> by telephone. `` As we talked tonight, he realized there will be persecution,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But our home is open.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, linked to a bomb attack in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and an explosives arrest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, is a radical Japanese terrorist organization that has been relatively inactive in recent years. The army is a splinter faction of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed support from 850,000 of the 1.3 million college students in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the 1960s. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> apparently has not been involved in many attacks recently, although Japanese police went on alert last November when <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON>, 37, a long-sought army leader, was arrested in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and found to have a one-way ticket to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police theorized he had planned to disrupte <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s presidential elections in December The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was believed never to have grown beyond 300 members. Police action and internal feuding, climaxing with the killing of 14 members at a mountain hideout in 1971, sapped its strength. The group advocates `` simultaneous world revolution'' and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, police said Friday that a member of the group was the prime suspect in a car bombing Thursday outside a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club that killed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicewoman and four Italians. Seventeen people were injured. Investigators said they were searching for <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, 39, who also is suspected in rocket and bomb attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British embassies in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> last June. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, authorities Tuesday arrested a Japanese man after he was found with three bombs in his car. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, is being held on federal charges of possessing a fraudulent visa and illegally possessing unregistered firearms, the explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reported that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was believed to have established links to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

The army was also held responsible for the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight in 1977 shortly after it left <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Gunmen diverted the flight to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Once in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the terrorists demanded the release of six prisoners, including <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, from Japanese jails.

 The Turkish Cypriot administration said Friday it has started requiring Cypriots to carry passports if they cross the Green Line that divides this Mediterranean island.

Chambers stood silently while state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> handed down the predetermined sentence in a crowded <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> courtroom. As he did while pleading guilty, the defendant shook his head `` no'' several times during the session, including once when <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> repeated his guilty plea to manslaughter. `` <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s looking down, looking and wondering why this all happened. I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said later during his brief statement. `` I never wanted any of this to happen. I wish to apologize to her family and all her friends.'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> also apologized to his family and friends, and thanked more than 150 supporters for letters he has received since being jailed after his guilty plea. The Chambers case spotlighted the world of wealthy <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> youths and the underaged drinking, drugs and sex of their lifestyles. Among those in the courtroom for the sentencing were several Chambers trial jurors and several members of the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, the slain girl's father, was not permitted to speak at the hearing as he had requested. At the time of the plea, the jury was divided after several votes on the charge of second-degree murder, the stiffest Chambers faced, and sent notes to the judge saying they were at an impasse. The sentence followed a hearing before <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in which Chambers' attorney, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>, complained that the probation report on his client was `` slanted'' and asked for an opportunity to answer charges made by the prosecution in the report <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>'s request, telling the attorney to put his comments in writing. The sentencing was delayed for about an hour while <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> read <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>'s response to the probation report. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 21, agreed to the first-degree manslaughter plea in a deal with the district attorney as a jury deliberated second-degree murder charges against him, abandoning his story of an accidental death during `` rough sex'' in the park. The agreement was reached after two days of deliberations between prosecutors and Chambers' attorneys, and approved by the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family. A manslaughter conviction carries a maximum term of eight and one-third to 25 years. By pleading guilty to first-degree manslaughter in Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s strangulation, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> admitted he intended to hurt the teen during an encounter in Central Park on Aug. 26, 1986, and ended up killing her Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s bruised and nearly naked body was found beneath a tree behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art early on the morning of Aug. 26. The couple had run into each other earlier at a popular <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> `` preppie'' bar. Chambers' plea bargain also took care of three burglary charges against him.

 Soviet troops begin pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 30 days under an international pact signed here to end their 8-year-old intervention in that war-ravaged country. Prospects for Afghan peace remained dim, however. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed the international accord during a brief ceremony Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> building, where U.N.-mediated peace talks began six years ago. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today, the Soviets accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply weapons to the Moslem rebels fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is confirming its policy of neoglobalism, a course of export of counter-revolution,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in the first official Soviet press commentary issued since the signing of the pact. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was insisting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stop its military aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> both reserved the right to continue providing military assistance to the warring sides. `` History has been made today,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at a news conference following the signing of the accords, which go into effect May 15. The deposed king of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, proposed convening a `` loya jitga,'' or grand assembly of Afghan tribal leaders, to try to set up a transitional government. <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> made the comment Thursday in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where he has lived since being dethroned in 1973. He has been mentioned by various parties as possibly returning to play a role in an interim government. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees urged the safe and voluntary return of the more than 5 million Afghan refugees who have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> expects to spend hundreds of millions of dollars supervising the return, the largest repatriation effort ever. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials will present a detailed first-year plan within 10 days, refugee commissioner <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocke </PERSON> told a news conference. In addition to providing for the Soviet troop pullout, the accord also pledges non-interference by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in each other's affairs. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the withdrawal of Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where they have been supporting the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> against Moslem rebels since December 1979, would remove the cause of the `` brutal war.'' Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told a separate news conference that the agreements `` put an end to outside interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s affairs and make it possible for the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people to establish peace and harmony in their land.'' Others disagreed. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said: `` I see trouble and turmoil in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> through the insurgency, through the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- trying to achieve their objective to overthrow this regime and establish their own authority.'' He said `` that will mean more loss of life.'' The guerrillas' seven-party alliance rejected the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and vowed to keep fighting to topple the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. No resistance members attended Thursday's ceremony. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the rebels are based, represented them at negotiations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> expressed some annoyance at a suggestion during his news conference that the accords were flawed because they did n't stop the fighting. The agreements, he said, `` are not perfect. Everybody can find something wrong with them, but we're practical people trying to achieve important ends.'' He also brushed aside comments by <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in his news conference that continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the resistance forces would violate international law. `` It would surprise me if they challenged our right to resupply,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters aboard his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet on the return flight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He noted that a decision by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep helping the guerrillas and by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to continue aiding the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government had been thoroughly aired during the weeks before the signing. Under the pact's provisions, the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers will be out in nine months, with half leaving in the first three months after May 15. The Soviets have indicated they may complete the pullout by the end of this year. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> was given a mandate to continue promoting a political dialogue between the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and the rebels. The agreement does not deal with the question of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future government

 Passengers fainted and some oxygen masks did n't work after a <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> jetliner engine exploded at 31,000 feet, its turbine blades puncturing the pressurized cabin, authorities said. The twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28, carrying 56 passengers and a crew of four, made an emergency landing at 10 a.m. Thursday at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s Yeager Airport. Two flight attendants were treated for minor injuries. The explosion shot engine debris through the rear of the cabin, ripping a 6-foot gash in the plane's right side and a 2-foot hole in the left side, narrowly missing the other engine. `` It began with a wearing noise and loud vibrations about five or 10 times straight, and then there was an explosion in the back of us,'' passenger <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today after inspecting the plane Thursday afternoon and evening. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> crews dispatched to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> were given control of the plane today. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who was sitting three rows from the rear of the plane when the cabin depressurized, said a woman traveling with two children passed out in the seat behind him. `` She fainted. I turned around and she was blue. The baby was blue. And her 3-year-old was blue,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` I grabbed her and put a mask on her, gave the baby to a woman who was sitting next to her and I took the 3-year-old up with me.'' Flight 486 was en route from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, when the right jet turbine exploded about 9:45 a.m., <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> officials said. `` It blew a big hole in the plane,'' passenger <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said. `` I'm 240 pounds, and it was big enough that I could crawl through it. One of the turbine blades came right through the bathroom. We're lucky no one was in it.'' The plane lost cabin pressure and went into a dive. Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and flight attendants and adult passengers went through the aisles and assisted children, passengers said. But some did n't work and passengers moved to other seats. After the plane landed safely, several passengers later complained of headaches, earaches and elevated blood pressure. `` This could have easily been more serious than it was,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, assistant airport manager. Most passengers were placed on a connecting flight, but a handful rented cars and said they would continue the trip by ground. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said he did n't know when the plane's engines had been checked last. The engine was manufactured by <PERSON> Rolls </PERSON> <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>. Computers are used to maintain parts aboard the plane, including engines and oxygen masks, he said. The reported failures of the oxygen masks will be investigated, he said. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> owns 25 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 4000 Series aircraft, which seat a maximum of 72 passengers. It also owns 20 1000 Series craft, which carry 62. It was the first serious problem reported with the Dutch-made F-28s in the four years <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> has owned them, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> has on file only two injury-related accidents involving <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28s, spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. One jet was involved in a minor taxiway collision at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Oct. 24, 1985, and on Dec. 30, 1986, an unassisted handicapped passenger fell off the boarding stairs when a guardrail gave way, he said.

 A big jump in wholesale prices dealt another blow today to financial markets still reeling from an unexpected rise in the trade deficit, pushing stocks down further after Thursday's $ 100 billion selloff. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 4.31 points at 2,001.33 at 12:30 p.m. EDT. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 7 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in the session, the average was down by more than 20 points. The average took a 101.46-point plunge Thursday, which was triggered by a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit rose to $ 13.8 billion in February. The rise of 0.6 percent in wholesale prices in March reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today was the biggest in 11 months and heightened concerns that the economy was becoming overheated. `` It's part of the whole inflationary thesis: the weak dollar, rising imports and strengthening prices all spell difficulty for the economy later on,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, an investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, noting the big decline in the markets on Thursday, said, `` I think that we've paid for this bad news in the last day and a half already.'' Long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices also fell again today, putting interest rates at a three-month high. But the dollar held about even today after falling sharply Thursday. Overnight on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 225 </ORGANIZATION> selected issues lost 217.78 points to end the day at 26,893.57, a decline of less than 1 percent. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, stock prices edged narrowly lower. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 8.6 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,778.6. It had been off 24.1 points at the opening. In today's report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the March rise in wholesale prices of 0.6 percent followed a 0.2 percent drop in February. Many analysts had been looking for an increase in March on the order of a 0.2 percent rise. If the March rate held for 12 months, the full-year wholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for all of 1987. In midday trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, the dollar was bid at 123.8 Japanese yen and 1.66 West German marks. The benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond was off about -LCB- point, or about $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield edged up to 8.93 percent from 8.86 percent late Thursday. In foreign exchange Thursday, the dollar fell about 2 percent against the Japanese yen and West German mark despite central bank purchases aimed at bolstering the dollar, and bond market interest rates rose to their highest levels since January. The trade report raised concerns that the dollar would remain under pressure despite a months-old agreement by major industrialized nations to support it. That agreement was reaffirmed Wednesday by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Investors worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might try to support the falling currency by pushing interest rates higher. On Wall Street, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones nearly 11 to 1 in the worst day since the widely-followed Dow Jones average fell 140.58 points on Jan. 8. The Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation that February's trade news would be favorable. The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks fell by $ 99.7 billion in Thursday's plunge, according to a 5,000-stock index measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> In the bond market, the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond jumped to roughly 8.86 percent Thursday, the highest since January, from 8.73 percent late Wednesday The trade report also battered major foreign markets. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent on Thursday. Some economists called the markets' fears an overreaction. `` The quality -LRB- precision -RRB- of the numbers obviously leaves something to be desired,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The trade report indicated consumers were continuing to spend strongly, sucking up imports, <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON> said. The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $ 17.6 billion in October. It was up from January's $ 12.4 billion gap, but was down from a deficit of $ 14.4 billion in February 1987. `` It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, director of economic research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sun shines on rustling palms, the airport bustles with the world's business, and on the isolated `` plane of martyrdom'' three dozen people wait for their captors to kill them or set them free. The blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, hijacked April 5, faces north toward the main terminal and control tower about 400 yards away. From the cockpit, crew members talk with the tower about air conditioner maintenance, delivery of food and other routine matters. Police presence is discreet. Four small armored cars encircle the plane, but no soldiers are in sight. Algerian officials, proud of their country's ability to deal with both revolutionaries and conservative governments, note repeatedly that the gunmen have promised to refrain from violence while here and say an assault on the plane is out of the question. The hijackers killed two passengers during five days spent on the ground at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. At least 200 reporters and photographers patrol the sunbaked lawn between the terminal and the VIP lounge and fight for the scarce, unreliable telephones that were installed after the plane arrived early Wednesday. From the lawn, shaded by tents erected Wednesday night by blue-uniformed soldiers, journalists peer at the plane through binoculars and telephoto lenses. Now and then, Algerian officials climb the stairway and are allowed to enter the jumbo jet for 15 to 30 minutes of continuing, but episodic, negotiations with the hijackers. Talks between Algerian mediators and a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation take place elsewhere, presumably in government offices downtown. Passenger jets land every 10 or 20 minutes and taxi past the hijacked plane to discharge passengers into the crowded terminal, which is dusty from construction that has closed its self-service restaurant. Airport workers and taxi drivers show intense interest and press journalists for information about the standoff with the hijackers, who demand freedom for 17 pro-Iran extremists convicted of bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1983. On Wednesdy night the drama heightened. Two buses pulled up to the plane, official cars raced across the tarmac, the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation stood expectantly in what looked like a receiving line and the moving stairway approached the plane's front door. The control tower radioed the cockpit to say an official was ready to enter. The response: `` We are praying.'' An Algerian official entered. Rumors flew. He left. The Kuwaiti receiving line disbanded, reformed, then disappeared. Hours ticked away toward midnight, and it seemed that whatever had been on was off. There was no official explanation. Suddenly a hijacker was helping a hostage hobble down the stairs. Less than a minute later the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> businessman was being guided into a portion of the VIP lounge barred to reporters. His 10-day ordeal was over. Soon afterward, radio scanners recorded a statement from the hijackers describing themselves as `` men of principle'' and restating their demand for the release of the 17 prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> `` even if the price we have to pay is very high.''

<TEXT>
 American companies here say they're caught in the middle of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new economic sanctions and may have to close if they're not allowed to resume payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gave its workforce in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a 15-day paid furlough because of the problems in doing business, a company spokesman said Friday. Another company has given its employees `` collective vacations'' since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> froze all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments to the Panamian government on April 8, in an attempt to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power. A source familiar with the company's situation said it would not reopen until conditions are such that it can pay taxes in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> order prohibits direct or indirect payments, including income taxes, by Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to the Panamanian government. It also applies to Panamanian corporations owned or directed by Americans. Violators can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined $ 50,000. Companies have been told that until any exemptions are announced, the order is being enforced to its fullest extent _ right down to the $ 30 departure tax charged at the airport to people leaving the country. `` You ca n't move, you ca n't do anything without breaking the law,'' the head of one company said. `` The executive order puts a gun against my head and the -LRB- Panamanian -RRB- government has a gun against my head, and I'm just ducking,'' he said. All the executives spoke on condition of anonymity. Several company representatives said they were complying with the order and continued to operate, but they noted they did not yet have tax or other payments due the government. Commerce and Industries Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> has said the government will be flexible with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. But if electricity, water and telephone bills are not paid, the utilities services run by the government will be cut off. `` We were n't ordered to close, but it just does n't make sense to stay open,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We are not permitted to pay our utility bill. We ca n't pay the phone bill.'' One executive said the ability of American manufacturers to continue operating also would depend on whether they have enough raw materials in stock, since importing also requires payments to the government. `` We're hoping there will exceptions for essential items,'' a food company executive said. `` We have tax payments to the government but can not pay them,'' he added. `` We're caught in the middle.'' `` Sooner or later, the executive order is going to shut everybody down. The executive order will totally kill <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said some companies paid high taxes the first three quarters, but owed less for the year because of the economic crisis and now have credits, allowing them to postpone a payment decision. An American trade association representative said the law was hurting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies more than its target, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` In essence it's closing down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and sending Americans home and not affecting Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at all. I expect some leeway will have to be allowed,'' he said. `` Really you're a hostage here in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the airport tax. Panamanian residents also may not leave the country without showing what amounts to an income tax receipt. American businesses are worried about the progressive penalties the Panamanian government may charge if it decides to let the companies pay taxes late. Most executives said they would comply with the sanctions, but a number were said to be looking for ways to get around it. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Psychoyos </PERSON> said he and his father, both American citizens, have taken leaves of absence from the Panamanian-owned supermarket chain they headed. `` Non-Americans will run the company for a while. From all they said, this is all we can do,'' he said. `` I think most companies are evaluating now whether they want to be thrown in jail in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Psychoyos </PERSON> said the supermarket chain will continue payments to the government. `` We've got to abide by the laws. We've been here 80 years and we hope to be another 80,'' he said. Under the order, companies are to make their normal payments to an escrow account at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> established for <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was ousted from the presidency by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 26 after trying to fire the general.

<TEXT>
 In a world fascinated by computers and semiconductors, there's still a place for the serious consideration of abominable snowmen, frog showers and reincarnation. It can be found in a little-known magazine named for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist who researched the inexplicable `` just to knock holes in the smug orthodoxy of the scientists of his age,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiveking </PERSON>, a co-editor. <ORGANIZATION> Fortean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, caters to readers who think there just might be something to the hollow Earth theory, crying statues and close encounters of any kind. The odd, little periodical keeps its subscribers up to date with the latest on human horns, winged cats, giant squids and, of course, UFOs and the <ORGANIZATION> Loch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monster </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fortean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> is `` a bulletin about what is peculiar in the world,'' Seiveking says. Its name and philosophy come from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON>, an iconoclastic <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist who died in 1932. He spent his later years at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION>, researching the inexplicable. Being a Fortean means believing `` there's a continuum between subjective and objective experience, between dream and hard fact,'' <PERSON> Seiveking </PERSON> said. More importantly, however, it means `` conditional acceptance'' of things that `` orthodox explanation ca n't account for'' _ at least until further evidence comes along. Seiveking and co-editor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> Fortean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 15 years ago, put the magazine together at home in their spare time, and try their best to publish it quarterly. Their material comes from a dedicated Fortean cadre of about 60 correspondents, mostly unpaid, who scour the world's newspapers and other media for weird and wonderful tales to fill the magazine's 80 or so pages. Every month, the editors meet to classify the material their correspondents have gathered into about 35 main categories, `` like phantom smells, strange sounds, lights, stuff falling from the sky,'' Seiveking said. `` There's a lot of laughter in what we do,'' he admitted during a break from his regular job as an editor for a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reference book publisher. But he said the job also has a serious side. `` We're trying to broaden people's horizons. We see ourselves as chroniclers, as sort of scientists as well as being entertainers.'' A recent issue featured purportedly new photographs of the Yeti, the mysterious abominable snowman of the Himalayas, as well as items about giant whirlpools in the seas off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and fireballs in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and a `` reincarnation round-up.'' Finding a <ORGANIZATION> Fortean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> subscriber may be only a little easier than tracking down the Yeti. Just 2,500 of them are scattered in 36 countries, including 500 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At $ 3 a copy, the magazine just about breaks even. Regular readers, said <PERSON> Seiveking </PERSON>, include `` little old ladies who are spiritualists, people in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, professors, science fiction writers, journalists in obscure little countries who like to keep up with this kind of thing.'' They're a small, but faithful band who do n't let a few facts get in the way of a good time. `` While the real nature of the ` Cottingly Fairy' photographs is now apparent,'' one Australian reader recently wrote in a letter to the editor, `` surely the Fortean reaction will be that they are only relative fakes. For, in the spectrum of bogus-genuine, there must somewhere -LRB- in this or another world -RRB- exist photographs of real fairies.'' Not quite believing while not quite disbelieving always gives Forteans an out. It allowed the author of a recent piece on the luminous magnetic cloud supposedly encountered by a British steamship in 1904 to conclude: `` Although I remain disturbed by the suspicious aspects of the story, I am slightly inclined to think that the story is true.'' As long as there are mysterious lights in the sky and things that go bump in the night, Seiveking and <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> hope to keep publishing their `` journal of strange phenomena.''

 An ancient mummy found in a pawnshop is likely the body of a man who died at the age of 35 and would have had a longer and more comfortable life in the age of antibiotics, university scientists say. <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> paid a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> pawnbroker $ 40,000 for the 2,300-year-old mummy two years ago and asked the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, to run a battery of tests. The medical school set up a `` mummy team'' in 1985 to conduct similar tests on an ancient head acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of Egyptian Art and Archaeology The team tested tissue and hair samples and took hundreds of X-rays, and announced Thursday that the Egyptian apparently died of a brain abscess caused by an ear infection. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist, said the man was 5 feet tall, probably right-handed and had thinning brown hair, and also suffered from serious tooth infections. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>, a radiologist with the medical school, said the Egyptian had an infection that ate through a bone near his left inner ear and may have led to a fatal brain abscess. `` That's a reasonable cause of death,'' he said. `` We only have the bone for speculation because we do n't have the brain.'' <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, an Egyptologist from <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said the mummy was named Iret-Irew, according to inscriptions on its coffin. The mummy was brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1920s. It was kept at a museum in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> until 1976, when it was sold to an antique dealer.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blasted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today for having supported a `` dope-peddling'' dictator in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said one reason Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has lasted so long is that he has been getting money from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. All three Democratic candidates campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, four days before the state's primary, with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ridiculing his rivals as latecomers in the fight against illegal drugs and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> saying troubles at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reflected hands-off, greed-promoting values encouraged by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. New polls confirmed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead among <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> running second and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> a poor third. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will go.'' He said he did not know about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in drug trafficking until the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader was indicted in this country. Citing `` several reliable sources,'' he said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been able to stay in power despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions at least partly because he has been receiving millions of dollars from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Speaking before the same forum, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he still hoped his supporters could play a key role in the Republican convention in August. But he ackowledged, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will probably have things his own way.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made strong anti-drug remarks to students today at a junior high school in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. He spoke informally rather than giving the prepared remarks that aides had distributed to reporters. In those remarks, he asked rhetorically, `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON> and Mr. Vice President, what is going on? `` Why do we have the money for Star Wars but not for the war against drugs? And why did you pay $ 200,000 a year to a dope-peddling, gun-running Panamanian dictator?'' _ a reference to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spoke to about two dozen members of pilots, mechanics and flight attendants unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> early today, saying `` mismanagement of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, et cetera, stands as a symbol of the kind of approach <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> encourage with their policies of hands off, let'em have whatever kind of labor relations they want, promote greed as the principal guiding value for corporate America.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has refused to endorse any of the three Democratic contenders, saying he will wait until after the last primaries on June 7. Earlier in the week, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the governor was generous in his praise of the former civil rights activist. On Thursday, however, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lack of experience in elective office could hurt him if he won the nomination. `` I could make a better case for him if he had been a public official,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. Before <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> decided to hold off any endorsement, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been considered the odds-on favorite to win the governor's backing. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also had hoped to get the support of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor surprised many observers by announcing his backing of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, whom he described as `` a man of intellect, courage and integrity.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said that on the issue of support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was `` head and shoulders'' above the other two Democrats. The mayor said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was never in contention for his endorsement, but that he would back him if he became the party nominee. He added however that his support of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be based `` not because of his positions but because he would be less destructive of the country than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> needed all the help he could get in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which holds its primary next Tuesday with 255 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 45 percent to 28 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll, 46 percent to 34 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> poll and 49 percent to 34 percent in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had only 8 percent support in two polls and 7 percent in the third. `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s numbers are flat across the board,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>. While things can change before Tuesday's vote, `` certainly nothing much moved this week except for solidity to the front-runners. `` I only believe polls that show me way in front,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> commented after the debate. The latest confrontation offered no sign of a breakthrough. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> pressed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> once again on his statement to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that he would consider use of nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` This is a serious mistake'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, referring to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> statement. When <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> raised the issue again later in the debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` Do n't pick up the morning newspaper and then have a press conference. Give me a buzz and I'll tell you exactly what I said and there'll be much less confusion.'' When <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> first took <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to task, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> misrepresented what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had told the newspaper. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was simply restating longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, said there was `` a real danger in those of us who may very well lead our country to get trapped into a hypothetical situation on who will shoot your gun first and destroy the whole world to prove that you got macho.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> widened his delegate lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to 112, when 26 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members supporting him were nominated to be among the so-called super delegates to the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up 15 delegates in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> got 11. A total of 251 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be delegates to the convention.

The divisions are emerging at a time when the frequency and size of street clashes is diminishing, and the nature of the confrontation is changing into more of an economic test of wills. There are two basic splits in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ranks: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is at odds with the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> factions on the issue of convening an international conference to negotiate peace. _ The Communists, in a dispute over tactics, have pulled out of the PLO-affiliated underground command, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>. The underground has announced weekly action programs in a series of leaflets. But starting in early March, there have been multiple versions, some making conflicting demands on the 1.5 million residents of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the latest handbill, No. 13, one version calls for three days of general strikes to mark `` Prisoners' Day'' while another version, apparently Communist, called for sit-ins at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> offices and other locations. `` There are differences on how to act, on tactics, `` conceded <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON>, a journalist with the daily <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Taalia </PERSON>. As an example, <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON> cited the repeated calls for general strikes, which he said kept workers away from jobs at a time when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was using economic measures in an effort to put an end to the uprising. `` If <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is putting economic pressure on people, and we also put pressure on people, then we are doing what <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wants,'' said <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON>, who added workers would ignore strike calls if they became excessive. Instead of general strikes that hurt low-income Palestinians, <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON> said the Communists supported a boycott of Israeli products. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s government <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, about half the 110,000 Arabs who hold jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> went to work in February and March. Oficials claim the on-the-job figure has risen recently, although statistics were not available. After Palestinians stopped paying taxes, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities imposed financial and trade restrictions and put the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s 8,000 teachers on half-pay for three weeks The army has also ordered stores closed when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflets said they should be open. `` Food is very expensive. People are feeling the seriousness of the economic strikes,'' <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Araj </PERSON>, the pro-Jordanian mayor of <PERSON> Beit </PERSON> <PERSON> Jallah </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. A second split is between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of fundamentalist groups that has a large following in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. To counter the increasing Islamic influence, the PLO-affiliated factions, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Islamic Jihad formed a coalition in early January. Called the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, it has followed the policies of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in seeking an international peace conference and in not escalating clashes by using guns and knives. The fundmentalists, however, oppose negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and seek creation of a pan-Islamic, rather than Palestinian, state. `` The first phase of the uprising is winding down, and they -LRB- Palestinians -RRB- disagree about the second phase, about where to go from here,'' said Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman. `` There are feelings of fatigue. The people want to see some results,'' he added. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said another split threatening the unity of the underground was Islamic Jihad's desire to wage armed struggle, a policy opposed by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> groups. Despite the disputes, <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON> said the resistance would continue because local committees rather than the leaflet writers had the final say on whether to observe calls for strikes and protests. For example, he said he doubted whether local committees would heed the call in the latest leaflet to throw firebombs on April 21, the so-called `` Day of the Palestinian Molotov.'' The army spokesman said the overall level of violence had dropped markedly in recent weeks even though the bloodshed had not ceased altogether. `` The intensity of the clashes is still high, but there are fewer confrontations and the size of demonstrations is smaller, a hundred or so instead of thousands,'' said <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>. There have been 7,000 clashes between soldiers and demonstrators since Dec. 8, killing 146 Arabs and two Israelis. More than 1,000 Arabs have been wounded by gunfire. `` I think we are now in an ebbing phase of the uprising. We've already reached the peak But when it finally subsides, I do n't think it will go back to the same level it started at four months ago,'' said <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON>, a philosophy professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Welfare and Property Tax Laws Stir Thatcher Rebellion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s controversial social welfare legislation is stirring the fiercest opposition she has encountered since her re-election last June. The resistance is coming not just from the opposition, but from rank-and-file lawmakers within her own <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who on Thursday night staged their biggest back-bench revolt since June. Twenty-eight of the 376 Tories in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted against the government's decision to end free dental checkups and eye examinations. The sums involved _ $ 5.60 for the dental checkup _ are small, but they matter to the poor and they come in the same month as the top income tax rate is being slashed from 60 to 40 percent. And while the number of rebels looks relatively small, any revolt is significant, given Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s strong-willed style of leadership. Customarily, a lawmaker voting against his government almost automatiucally destroys his chances of winning government office. The social welfare moves and a controversial reform of property taxes, another <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> brainchild, have combined to arouse deep unease among sections of the Parliamentary rank-and-file about her radical third term program. `` At the heart of the debate is a fear that the very well-off make substantial gains which are wholly financed by the less well-off,'' said Conservative legislator Sir <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a leading rebel. `` Playing around with rebates for the poor in no way tackles that fundamental inequity.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> remains determined to wean Britons off what she calls the `` dependency culture'' and encourage private enterprise. She points to the economic revival her rigorous policies have wrought, including the fastest growth rate in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the country's first budget surplus in nearly two decades. But there are signs of defensiveness. On Thursday night, the 62-year-old prime minister made a comparatively rare foray into the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> tea room to rally support for the new property tax, popularly called the poll tax. And the government announced an extension of rebates, costing about $ 245 million and affecting 1 million people, in a move to blunt another rebellion when the poll tax comes up for a key vote Monday. That concession appeared aimed at heading off a major revolt Monday in the 650-member Commons, where the Conservatives' hefty 102-seat majority was whittled to 81 and 74 in Thursday's votes. Under the poll tax, families will be rated according to how many adults are living in the home. Estimates are that the tax on some homes will more than double, hitting modest earners hardest. `` It will manifestly be perceived to be unfair,'' complained another <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> legislator, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mates </PERSON>, who hopes to get about 50 colleagues to back an amendment that would base the tax on income instead of a flat charge. Like changes in housing subsidies which force everyone, including public housing tenants, to pay at least one-fifth of the property taxes on their homes, the poll tax is fundamental to a Thatcher onslaught on local councils. The local councils, which run local government, are dominated by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s left-wing. They levy and spend property taxes and most of the bigger councils are run by the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Guardian newspaper, the nation's foremost liberal daily, argued that <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> legislators with narrowly held seats are frightened by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s measures. `` Where damaging policy changes were unable to provoke a revolt, political survival has succeeded,'' it said. A straw poll among 100 rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> legislators by another daily, The Independent, found nearly two-thirds expressing alarm at the social security changes. The government says it is merely refocusing the $ 86 billion welfare budget on the most needy. But opposition and welfare groups estimate that two-thirds of the 8.6 million welfare claimants will lose funds. The government acknowledges 43 percent will receive less. Polls show the Conservative government is losing support. Gallup's March poll showed the Conservatives 5.5 points ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, down from 10 the previous month. Two-thirds of the 1,094 voters questioned said they thought the tax-cutting budget announced March 15 was `` not fair.'' The Conservatives received 42 percent support _ enough for another victory _ with Labor getting 36.5 percent and the rest split among two center parties and minority regional parties

 Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in March, the government said Friday, somewhat counterbalancing signs that inflation is reheating. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said gains in production of autos and business equipment offset declines in construction supplies and consumer goods other than cars. The slight March advance followed no change in February and, according to economists, is an indication that the pickup in wholesale prices may not be sustainable. `` It is n't the type of boom production environment that would support rapid gains in inflation,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate report Friday, said wholesale inflation was running at a 7 percent annual rate in March. That news sent jitters through the financial markets and pushed interest rates higher. `` Ironically, a fairly low growth rate in industrial production is good in one sense ... It may actually allay suspicions that the economy may be on the verge of overheating,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. Before February, production had been increasing at a steady pace: 0.5 percent in November and December and 0.4 percent in January. The last decline was in September, when production fell 0.2 percent. Production had shot up 1.1 percent in October. Despite two months of lackluster growth, production levels in March were a strong 5.6 percent above levels a year ago. The March rise included a 0.2 percent jump in production at manufacturing plants after a flat performance in February. That included a 2.6 percent increase in auto production, which followed a 0.8 percent drop in February, and a 0.6 percent boost in production of equipment used by businesses, the fourth consecutive gain. Factories making durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, saw output rise 0.3 percent last month; output at plants making non-durable goods was unchanged for the second month in a row. Mining output increased 0.4 percent after a 1.0 percent drop in February. Output at utilities dropped 1.2 percent after a 0.5 percent increase. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said the drop at utility companies was caused by warmer-than-usual weather in March. He predicted that industrial production overall would pick up in coming months. `` We ought to see auto production coming up ... Inventories are now down to near-normal levels. The drop in utilities should be over,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. The various changes left industrial production at 134.6 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>Nation's First Case of Electronic Income-Tax Fraud Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities say a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> man has been indicted in the nation's first case of income tax fraud involving electronic filing of tax returns. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>, 42, is accused in a 12-count indictment of fraudulently applying for tax refunds under false names through a professional tax-return preparer in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The preparer was not charged. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> returned the indictment Thursday. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> borrowed money from financial institutions based on the fraudulent tax refunds he expected to receive, said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Electronic filing of federal income-tax returns is available in 16 regions, one of which includes <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says the program results in faster processing of returns and lower costs. It is expected to be available nationally by the mid-1990s. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> assumed the identities of dead or fictitious people, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzalsky </PERSON> stopped at the Horse Around Bar to buy a frozen pizza, but he got a taste of history and a gander at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution before heading home with his dinner. `` Who built that?'' <PERSON> Buzalsky </PERSON> asked, circling a traveling exhibit the state put together to celebrate the 200th birthday of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. `` There's a lot of reading.'' The Horse Around Bar, one of two businesses in this prairie ranching town, is playing host to the four-sided display through Monday, because there is no other place for it in the county. The wooden exhibit was too large to fit through the doors of either the nearby <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> or the school, and a church that could accommodate it was already booked. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, who moved to <PERSON> Amidon </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> four years ago to open the <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Around </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, said he gladly volunteered a large garage and storage room attached to his saloon for the exhibit. Nine people had signed a guest book `` ratifying'' the Constitution by Thursday afternoon. `` Some spend quite a lot of time back there reading the stuff and some just look it over, in and out,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said, sitting near rows of liquor bottles, sipping coffee. `` In a lot of ways, it is the conversation piece of the bar. -LRB- But -RRB- I really do n't think it will bring me any extra business.'' The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, headed by a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruction </ORGANIZATION> created the exhibit and intend to display it in each of the state's 53 counties. It's a mini-museum featuring old pictures, newspaper stories and brief narratives about segments of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s history that relate to individual freedoms and government powers. <PERSON> Amidon </PERSON> is in the southwest corner of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> about 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> and boasts that it's the smallest county seat in the country. `` You can say 25 to 30 people live here,'' <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON> said. `` It depends on what day it is.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, one of two teachers at the elementary school, said all 20 students would go see the historical display Friday. It did n't make any difference that the field trip essentially meant visiting a saloon, she said. `` The kids are used to it. They frequent it quite often with their parents for supper,'' she said. The sheriff, whose office just is across <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 85, examined the exhibit Wednesday night. `` They have an old <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> homestead on it,'' said <PERSON> Lorge </PERSON>, whose grandfather was sheriff for 18 years. `` I'm not so sure it's not the old Day place. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> moved his pickup from the garage, which used to be a repair shop for a farm supply store, to make way for the display. An old horse harness hangs on pegs on one wall, not far from a saddle. A wooden-wheeled wagon that <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> hitches to his Clydesdales sits nearby. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> claims the wagon is at least 75 years old. <PERSON> Buzalsky </PERSON>, a rancher, circled the constitutional exhibit with its red, white and blue ribbons a couple of times before leaning into a chest freezer to pick out a pizza. He did n't have time to read all the history on the display. `` I have to get the pizza going,'' he said. `` The women folks sent me to town to get it.''

<HEAD>`Computer Potato'' Has His Way of Life Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teen-ager <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> has his way of life back _ in a bigger and better way. The 17-year-old, who was born with gross motor impairment that limits his physical activity, could n't afford to replace his <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> 64 computer and disk drive when they were stolen from his home, but got several replacement offers after a story appeared in a local newspaper. On Thursday, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s computer equipment was replaced by a <LOCATION> Ridgeland </LOCATION> computer dealer. `` Thank you a lot,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said repeatedly after the computer was installed atop the family television set where his old computer sat. `` It's overwhelming,'' said his mother, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> Weeks, who earns $ 700 a month at a taxi company. `` It's marvelous. I do n't have the words to say how I feel To think of the total strangers that were willing to help. I did n't know that there were that many caring people out there.'' Weeks said their home telephone rang constantly with people who offered to give <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> a computer or money. After talking with several people, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Murrah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, accepted a new <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> PC XT computer offered by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a 1974 <PERSON> Murrah </PERSON> graduate. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> also got a color display, a modem and assorted software. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s stolen computer and disk drive were worth $ 400; <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s gift was valued at $ 3,000. `` It makes us feel good to help. I hope whoever got your computer the first time wo n't come back,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> saved four years' allowance and lunch money to purchase a computer. Earlier this month, a burglar broke into the <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> home and took the computer, a disk drive, $ 28 in cash and a small television. Weeks said the computer was the first thing her son sought after getting home from school. `` Every available moment he was sitting there,'' said Weeks, who calls her son a `` computer potato.'' `` It was his way of communicating with others. He can not get out and ride a bicycle or play baseball,'' she said. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a student in the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Murrah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said he used the computer to do homework and a science fair project, write short stories and invent games. He had planned to use his computer to teach computer basics during a camp this summer at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said the theft occurred `` just as I was going to really need it the most.'' The incident taught him several lessons. `` I'm overwhelmed,'' he said. `` I think this was a dual lesson. That computer was a favorite item in my life. I learned that you do n't get heavily attached to a thing like this. I learned about the giving of people.''

<HEAD>`Extraordinary' Community Response To Suicides Can Be Appropriate,
CDC Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tragedies of multiple suicides by young people can provide lessons for other communities to follow in the future, according to a new report by the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. On March 11, 1987, in <LOCATION> Bergenfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, two young men, 18 and 19, and two young women, 16 and 17, committed suicide by locking themselves in a garage and sitting inside a car with the motor running. Within days, school officials identified other students they felt might be at risk, counseling was provided to young people and a local suicide hotline and a walk-in counseling center were started. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report, as is the agency's custom, did not name the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> town where the four young people died on that date. But <LOCATION> Bergenfield </LOCATION> has been identified in numerous news reports about the deaths. After an investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted in its weekly report Thursday that `` when a suicide cluster does occur, an extraordinary amount of community effort and resources is temporarily devoted to suicide prevention.'' `` Such a response ... is appropriate,'' the Atlanta-based health agency said. `` It is prudent for a community faced with a suicide cluster to make every effort to anticipate and prevent additional suicides among susceptible individuals.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said communities should consider contingency plans for suicide clusters, and `` may want to consider implementing a suicide response plan before a cluster has begun.'' Many suicide clusters, the agency said, have followed one or more deaths due to injuries among young people. Planning ahead can keep communities from `` reinventing the wheel'' during their own tragedies, said Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no reason for every single community that runs into this to try to start from scratch. There's experience they can try to take advantage of,'' <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Bergenfield </LOCATION>, a suburban community six miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had an annual suicide rate of seven per 100,000 during 1980-84, significantly lower than the national rate of 12 per 100,000, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers found. But in that town and in others where people have died in apparent suicide pacts, there have been similarities, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said: other young people had died unnaturally before the suicides, and the suicides may have had a `` contagious'' effect, prompting others to try to kill themselves. The young <LOCATION> Bergenfield </LOCATION> men had both been friends of an 18-year-old who died in a fall from a cliff six months earlier. And after the four teen-agers killed themselves, two other young people _ a 20-year-old and a 17-year-old _ attempted suicide together in the same garage.

<HEAD>Fitzwater Says Plant Closing Provision Would Harm Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied Friday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's resistance to a labor-backed plant-closing provision in a new trade bill constitutes an anti-worker stance. While renewing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threat to veto the legislation if the plant shutdown notification requirement remained intact, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We're trying to keep people's jobs.'' `` We want a trade bill that does n't eliminate jobs through foreign competition,'' he said. `` We want a bill that maximizes the opportunities for companies to stay in business and people can keep their jobs,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` And that's what you're going to hear from us if we have to veto this bill.'' But during his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing, the spokesman acknowledged that administration negotiators on the sweeping trade bill are stymied in attempts to talk lawmakers into discarding the plant notification provision. `` I think there's still some opportunity for talk,'' he said. But he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not accept any version of the trade bill that contained provisions which are `` injurious to a dynamic economy.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reiterated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto intentions in the wake of a further deterioration of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit and as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members wrangled over the language to be kept in the final version of the 1,000-page trade bill. Conferees are trying to iron out differences between competing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the bill. The plant-closings provision, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but not the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would require companies with at least 100 employees to give 60-day notice of plant closings or layoffs involving at least 150 positions if that represented one-third of the work force. All layoffs of 500 or more would have to be accompanied by notice, regardless of whether they represented a third of the work force. Business groups oppose the provision, arguing that it could lead to other steps to strip away the prerogatives of company managers. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations in the labor movement maintain the measure is necessary to prepare workers for the need to find new employment. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made good progress in moving toward such a bill,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday. But he said the White House is displeased that the plant-closing provision remains in the bill. `` Our negotiators ... were encouraged to believe the plant closing provision would be eliminated,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Later, however, we were told that after certain consultations took place, they could not remove that provision. The labor unions apparently would sacrifice the entire trade bill for this provision.'' `` While the administration would be willing to accept a positive trade bill, we can not accept one that includes seriously flawed elements that will hurt <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitiveness,'' the spokesman said. `` If the bill reaches the president in its present form, the president will veto it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The Democratic leadership had seemed close to dropping the plant-closings plan on Wednesday. But overnight lobbying by organized labor led to a chorus of protests Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus, said sources who spoke only if not quoted by name. Top Democrats announced their support for the plan at midafternoon Thursday. They said new figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showing a widening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and an accompanying 101-point drop in the stock market called for a strong legislative response.

<HEAD>Star Trek-style Monitor Could Be On Market in 18 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The idea is something out of `` Star Trek,'' a hand-held device that a doctor or nurse can point at a patient to register heart and respiration rates. But the vital signs monitor which a new company hopes to put on the market in 18 months is expected to look more like a pocket calculator than the sleek cylinders used by Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> `` Bones'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> on the Enterpirse. And the device was inspired not by science fiction, but by a military need to help medics in the battlefield. A prototype somewhat bigger than a briefcase has been delivered to the military by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> researchers. The university has licensed <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Techniques </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company formed last August, to sell the technology to civilian health care providers. `` We think it has particular application for patients who are severely burned, where no contact -LRB- with the skin -RRB- is possible or looked for, and also with patients who may have a contagious disease or patients who have compromised immune systems and have to be isolated from contact with other people,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chief operating officer of Health Techniques. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the device would weigh 1 -LCB- to 2 pounds and would have a top range of six feet to 10 feet. He said the comparison to the chirping medical scanners on `` Star Trek'' is inevitable. `` I've heard that more times than you can imagine. It's really very close to that,'' he said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonasera </PERSON>, a research engineer on the Tech team which is developing the monitor, said the device depends on microwave transmissions bounced off the patient's body. `` Phase changes'' in the waves show the heart's movements, he said. In addition to the heart and respiratory rate functions, Health Techniques hopes the device can be refined to also measure body temperature. <PERSON> Bonasera </PERSON> said the monitor also can reveal information about the mechanical workings of the heart, something an electrocardiogram, or EKG, can not do. The researcher said more work is needed on interpreting the returning microwave signals to do that. Tech's work began in 1984 with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> funding. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> later contributed funding, and <PERSON> Bonasera </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also is interested. `` They're imagining, say, a chemical battlefield in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, that you have medics going around and picking up patients for trage and you want to limit the exposure of the medics. They want a device you could point at a patient to find out yes or no, is he alive?'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said other battlefield casualties also would benefit. `` In the military, we have situations where people are in all types of clothing; it makes it very difficult to put on a stethoscope or blood pressure test,'' he said.

 A day after his conviction on charges of killing three patients was overturned, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> heart surgeon <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> was allowed today to leave <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where he had been held prisoner for two years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy-Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday overturned <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s conviction because, the court said, `` the evidence was simply not sufficient.'' <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, held at the fort since 1986, was released from the prison itself Thursday, but was held overnite in the base's bachelor officers quarters while administrative paperwork was completed <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> automatically returns to active duty with his previous rank of commander and is eligible for $ 120,000 in back pay, but he can not practice medicine, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, Lt. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mescus </PERSON>. She said <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> would probably be assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy-Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> reserve center in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> while the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> makes a decision on appealing the verdict. The service has 20 days to make that decision. The court's 20-page opinion said prosecutors had failed to establish <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s guilt `` beyond a reasonable doubt.'' The appeals court said the prosecutors at <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s 1986 court martial `` lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass surgery is an inherently risky business.'' The prosecutors argued that <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> used questionable surgical techniques, the court said, but never really produced the evidence or testimony to demonstrate that <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s work in the operating room was so out of line as to constitute criminal conduct. `` We shall set aside all findings of guilty based on this factual insufficiency of the evidence,'' the court said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 20 days to file a formal motion with the appeals court asking it to reconsider the matter. The service said Thursday it had made no decision yet on pursuing an appeal. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, 57, was the former chief heart surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and held the military rank of commander He was convicted in early 1986 of two counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of negligent homicide in the deaths of three patients. He also was convicted on 18 of 24 counts of dereliction of duty stemming from other operations. He was sentenced on March 3, 1986, to four years in prison. Last summer, he was rebuffed in his first bid for parole. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s case attracted great public attention, in part because of the sensational nature of some of the charges. It also prompted congressional reviews of military health care in general and several large monetary settlements between the government and relatives of <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s patients. Prosecutors described <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> as an egocentric man, nearly blind in one eye, who hid his visual handicap and continued performing complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was killing patients. The appeals court, in its opinion, said it was troubled by <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s conviction because his court-martial had involved criminal charges as opposed to civil claims for damages based on negligence. The court quoted from a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that stated: `` The question is not whether a defendant should absorb the dollar loss of his victim, but whether his conduct justifies stamping him a criminal and sending him to state prison.'' In <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s case, the military court said it appeared the prosecutors `` lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass surgery is an inherently risky business ... and that those patients who agree to this elective surgery are quite ill in the first place ...'' `` Given the critical nature of the work and its complexity, these surgeons face a difficult enough task without having to worry about the spectre of the criminal prosecutor, waiting to reduce to a ` charge sheet' honest mistakes which fall far short of the gross, wanton and deliberate misconduct ... that truly deserves punishment. `` We are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the deaths that formed the basis of the appellant's conviction were due to any negligence, simple or otherwise, on his part.'' The court also faulted the presiding military judge at the court-martial for allowing the prosecution to conduct `` a smear campaign'' against <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>. `` The appellant was forced not only to defend against the charges, but also to explain and account for virtually all of his mistakes, professional setbacks or surgical misadventures during the previous 20 years. This ` bad surgeon' theory permeated the trial proceedings and undoubtedly influenced the court members' decisions.

 Dozens of Israeli settlers, guarded by as many soldiers, marched Friday near the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> town where 15-year-old settler <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> and two Palestinians were killed in an exchange of gunfire and rocks last week. Their purpose was to demonstrate that Jews could walk freely in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said they objected to the large army guard for the mass re-enactment of the hike by Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> and a group of friends. Israeli troops wounded two Palestinians in scattered violence Friday after midday prayers on the Moslem sabbath, hospital officials reported. The army deployed hundreds of soldiers and surrounded major mosques to keep order in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Violence after Friday prayers has become a ritual since violence began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. At least 146 Palestinians have been killed in the 18 weeks, along with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was ready to invite <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if he could be certain the invitation would be accepted, a spokesman said. The Soviet foreign minister is to visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> later this month. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers surrounded mosques in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> and imposed a curfew Friday in the downtown district of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Soldiers and Palestinians clashed at several mosques in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and two Palestinians were reported wounded. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Shifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said a 13-year-old boy from nearby <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION> in critical condition with a bullet wound in the stomach. They said an 18-year-old in Jabaliya was was shot in the leg, the officials said. The army confirmed clashes at Jabaliya but said soldiers used only rubber bullets, and said the <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION> incident was being investigated. An army helicopter flew surveillance over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s two main mosques as thousands of Moslem worshipers gathered to pray. After prayers, 250 youths circled <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque waving a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag. They shouted `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>! -LRB- God is Great! -RRB-'' and threw rocks and empty bottles at police. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> saw police detain five boys aged 7 to 9. They had been throwing rocks near Flower Gate, a northern entrance to the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that borders a main shopping street used by Jews and Arabs. <PERSON> Romam </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON>, a 26-year-old settler who guarded <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> and the other hikers April 6, was beaten on the head in clash with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents of <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> and has not regained conciousness. Investigative reports indicate the girl may have been killed by <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON>'s gun but the bullet has not been found. Maj. <PERSON> Gen </PERSON> <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, military commander of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, visited <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON> on Friday at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, brushing past members of the man's family who angrily asked him to go away. `` I do n't welcome the visit,'' said <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Yanir </PERSON>, 29. `` Romam is lying here because of the way <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> reacted to the Arab violence. A strong army should be feared not only when it's in the area, but also when it is not there.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the prime minister `` would very much like to welcome the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign minister to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for discussions, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will not just throw out an invitation. He needs to know the foreign minister will come.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Thursday after signing an accord on withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that it could open the way for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement. `` The signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements certainly stimulates positive processes in the settlement of other regional issues, including the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> proposal for an international conference including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

The prime minister suggests that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to a meeting and then leave the two adversaries to negotiate directly. He also says <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> must allow Soviet Jews to emigrate and must renew diplomatic relations severed during the 1967 war before it can have a part in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiations.

<HEAD>Officials Warn Against Unofficial Observances Of Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Polish authorities on Friday warned organizers of an unsanctioned ceremony to mark the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Jewish Ghetto Uprising that the gathering would be considered illegal, an organizer said. The warning came on the second day of a weeklong official anniversary to honor the victims of the Nazi Holocaust during World War II. It is the largest such event ever organized in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Friday, meanwhile, a Polish scholar told a scientific conference that she is ashamed of anti-Semitic behavior in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1968 and asked why more Polish officials, including some conference organizers, have not come forward to accept responsibility. About 4,500 people from around the world, including 2,000 from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> including <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, have come to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the Ghetto Uprising Anniversary, honoring the fighters who resisted the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto for three weeks in April and May of 1943. In addition to the official observances, a group of 46 intellectuals and opposition activists has called for an unofficial ceremony Sunday in front of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Fighters' Monument and in the old Jewish Cemetery. The group is led by <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a longtime opposition activist who is the last surviving commander of the uprising remaining in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> says he is boycotting the official observances because he considers them a cynical attempt by the government to win favor in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, an organizer of the unsanctioned ceremony and an adviser to the outlawed trade union Solidarity, said he was taken to a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> prosecutor's office for the warning talk by plainclothed police. `` I was told that the event which I am co-organizing on Sunday... is illegal ... so the authorities can not assure protection and the -LRB- organizing -RRB- committee will be morally and legally responsible for any possible provocations which might take place,'' <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said the committee intends to proceed with the observances anyway, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Ghetto Fighters' Monument and the dedication of a memorial in the Jewish Cemetery to two Polish-Jewish socialists executed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during World War II The alternative observances have come under heavy attack in the official media, which has charged the organizers with being anti-Soviet `` hyenas'' trying to take advantage of the anniversary to call attention to themselves. Meanwhile, on the second day of a two-day historical and scientific conference on the struggle of Jews and Poles under the Nazi occupation, <PERSON> Irena </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciejewska </PERSON> drew applause at the conference when she referred to the politically inspired anti-Semitic purge that took place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1968. Mrs. <PERSON> Maciejewska </PERSON>, who was delivering a paper on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Uprising in literature, said that when she cooperates with one official institution co-sponsoring the conference, the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, she finds herself `` in the company of people who injured the good name of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1968.'' To applause from the audience of several hundred people, she added: `` As a university person I painfully remember that time and as a Pole I should be ashamed of it.'' The Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, in a newspaper article last month, said anti-Semitism played a role in 1968 in political purges that caused thousands of Jews to lose jobs in government, journalism, the army and academia. Opposition activists criticized the statement as being too mild and for not identifying individuals involved, some of whom they charged still hold prominent positions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Vetoes Resolution on Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today vetoed a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to halt deportations of Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy said the measure was unbalanced. The vote was 14-1. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> envoy, <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veto as shielding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from international criticism. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has chosen to single itself out,'' he said. `` There's always a rotten apple in the box.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> cast the veto and said the resolution's `` broad and sweeping condemnation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contains not a scintilla of balance. It contains no appeal or request for calm.'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the resolution `` neither contributes to easing tensions in the occupied territories, nor promotes the cause of peace.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy said it was the fifth time since December that the council considered the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> situation. `` We do not regard this recurrent recourse to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as befitting its authority and prestige,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was engaged in a major diplomatic effort with the parties directly concerned to bring about direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and her Arab neighbors. The meeting of the 15-member council was prompted by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deportation of eight <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians this week Since anti-occupation unrest broke out Dec. 8, 146 Arabs have been killed in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The resolution, originally toughly worded, had been watered down in an unsuccessful effort to avert a veto by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which often kills resolutions critical of its ally. The vetoed resolution, supported by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all other council members, urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to halt deportations and condemned violations of human rights in the occupied territories. It called for a U.N.-sponsored settlement of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> problem. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> reflected new flexibility by his government on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> solution, diplomats said. In his speech, criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was not as strident as in earlier speeches and he emphasized the importance of `` balance of interests of all parties concerned, both Arabs, including the Palestinian people, as well as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He said a U.N.-sponsored international conference is `` the most effective machinery'' to achieve a political settlement. He indicated that `` interim arrangements'' could be acceptable and said that a conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> could be conducted on both a `` bilateral and multilateral basis.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have opposed an international conference that would impose a settlement upon <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and are opposed to participation by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. They have emphasized the importance of bilateral negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and her neighbors.

<HEAD>Unions Strike For Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About half of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s businesses closed Friday in the first day of a national strike called by a union demanding a 300 percent wage increase. The government of this chaos-ridden nation, which faces a severe economic crisis, has offered an increase of about 75 percent. Police said 50 percent of both Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> areas were closed in response to the strike call issued Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, or GCLU. Some banks, schools, restaurants, movie theaters, gas stations and other businesses closed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors as well as in other major cities and towns, a police statement said. However, a variety of businesses defied the 300,000-member union and maintained normal activity. The union called for the two-day strike after rejecting as insufficient the 75 percent increase in private - and public-sector wages announced by acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> `` Some employers are clearly defying the <ORGANIZATION> GCLU </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. They called their employees to work, and strangely these employees reported to duty,'' a police spokesman said. `` GCLU teams are touring <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other cities in an effort to convince violators to abide by the strike,'' said the spokesman. A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 75 percent increase `` is the highest the state treasury and private businesses can afford.'' `` The employees realize this. That's why they are hesitant in abiding by the strike,'' he said. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Srouji </PERSON>, who runs a ready-made clothes factory in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said even a 75 percent raise would be `` difficult to meet.'' `` We will have to raise our prices. In this case, the unions will start nagging again and demand another pay raise,'' <PERSON> Srouji </PERSON> said at his factory, which stayed open Friday. `` If the unions insist on a 300 percent raise, I will close,'' he threatened. `` Closing will strip my 70 employees from their income. Is this what the GCLU wants?'' Some of his employees also appeared convinced that the size of the raise demand was not in their interest. `` The boss will definitely fire most of us if the 300 percent increase was decided,'' said <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, who works at a hairdressing salon in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` There would be less clients if the raise was decided because the fees would be brought up sharply. In such a case, the boss and an assistant will be enough to handle the job, and most of us will be fired,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to be unemployed, especially when prices are soaring,'' he added. The Lebanese pound slipped against foreign currencies following <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' 75 percent pay increase announcement Thursday and closed at 400 to the dollar. It opened at 380 to the dollar early in the day. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s economy, once the most flourishing in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, has been hit hard by 13 years of violence. The pound, which rated 2.5 to the dollar before the outbreak of the civil war in 1975, has declined sharply against foreign currencies, pushing prices sky high in a nation that imports more than 85 percent of its needs.

 The government on Friday blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for lack of progress in negotiations for a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases agreement to replace an accord that expires in December. `` The American side does n't seem disposed to accept certain points and that's the reason why the discussions are essentially where they started,'' said government spokesman <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roubatis </PERSON>.

Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has repeatedly said that successful negotiation of a new bases accord will be linked to progress on these issues. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to be drawn into regional disputes. Negotiations for a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases agreement to replace the existing five-year accord began in November. Officials have held four rounds of monthly three-day sessions to try to hammer out a new agreement. The next meeting is set for next week in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Four American bases have operated in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since the 1950s _ two near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and two on the southern island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was `` deeply distressed'' over a resolution approved by the Danish parliament which closes a loophole in a government ban on ships carrying nuclear weapons into Danish ports. The resolution, approved Thursday by a 75-58 vote, requires the government to inform visiting naval vessels of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear policy <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has a nuclear ban policy but has not been asking such vessels if they are carrying nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said implementation of the Danish resolution in a way which is inconsistent with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not discussing which ships carry nuclear weapons would undercut <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> security. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a long-standing policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships. `` This policy is central to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to fulfill its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commitments,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We are not going to change it.'' `` It would have extremely serious consequences for U.S.-Danish defense cooperation,'' he said, adding that the impact of this issue extends beyond bilateral relations. `` It goes to the very heart of the meaning and interlocking nature of our mutual commitments within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance,'' he said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the policy of withholding information about the presence of nuclear weapons is aimed at keeping `` terrorists and saboteurs'' in the dark and makes effective attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces more difficult. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will review together with the Danish government and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies the implications of the resolution for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and continued defense cooperation with <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Reverses Decision To Fire Japanese Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military on Friday reversed an earlier decision to lay off 271 Japanese employees at its bases on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hiroo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takakura </PERSON>, head of the labor division of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision followed talks since last year between Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Military Forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had planned the layoffs because the yen's recent rise against the dollar made it more expensive to maintain employees. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials notified the Japanese government of the decision Friday, <PERSON> Takakura </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed last month to assume a larger share of the costs of running <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Army soldiers on Friday captured 10 followers of the fugitive leader of a bloody coup attempt in raids the military said foiled a plot to attack the presidential palace. The military went on nationwide alert this week to guard against any coup attempt while President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was visitin <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Chief military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said those arrested included eight navy guards who helped former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escape his prison ship 13 days ago. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led the attempted coup last Aug. 28. The failed coup in August left at least 53 people dead and more than 300 others wounded. Among those hurt was Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s only son, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said the operation was continuing but that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> remained at large. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> had been detained on the navy ship since his arrest last December in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb. Col. <PERSON> Emiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Templo </PERSON>, leader of the raiding party, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the military learned of a plot to attack the presidential compound `` so we acted quickly. We pre-empted the plan.'' <PERSON> Templo </PERSON> said the conspirators allegedly planned to approach the palace by rubber boats, traveling down a nearby stream which flows into the Pasig river. The presidential palace is on the banks of the Pasig in the heart of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Templo </PERSON> did not say when the attack was to have been carried out. Government television reported that the raids foiled `` a destabilization plan'' which was to have been launched Friday night. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> left Thursday for a four-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. It was her first trip abroad since visiting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in November 1986. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was notified of the raids by telephone in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and `` she was delighted with what happened.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> met Friday with Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> agreed that their rival claims to the <LOCATION> Spratly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> should be settled peacefully, a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> also said they would take steps to reduce <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s large trade surplus with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesman. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said three Marine companies and 30 police and soldiers carried out the raids in the swank <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> district of suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said the raid on the house where the 10 men were found lasted only 15 minutes, and there was no resistance. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said up to eight houses were raided, but all those arrested were found in one dwelling. They included Lt. <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojica </PERSON>, commander of the security force aboard the ship from which <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped. Two of those arrested were civilians, <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said. Troops seized 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light machine gun, five Israeli-made Uzi machine guns, five radio sets, a grenade launcher, several grenades and ammunition. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> told reporters that the 10 denied planning any attacks. Last week, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> said in a statement that he was withdrawing a pledge made a month before his arrest that he would refrain from `` hostile acts'' against the Aquino government. Earlier Friday, the military announced the filing of the first mutiny charges against officers linked to <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s failed coup. Military spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabingan </PERSON> said those formally charged included two lieutenant colonels, a major and two lieutenants. They were to be arraigned before a military court Monday, he said. In other developments, police clashed Friday with stone-throwing leftists near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and blocked a nearby march by militant Moslems protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> two years ago. Two demonstrators and one policeman were injured in the clash.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for not doing enough to curb illicit drug flows could actually lead to an increase in such traffic. `` Far from serving as a catalyst for action, this vote castigates a friend for less than perfect behavior,'' department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He added that the resolution, approved Thursday night, fails to recognize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s substantial anti-drug efforts and the `` extremely positive response'' of President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for enhanced cooperation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 63-27 to overturn a finding made by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> six weeks ago that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was `` fully cooperating'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the war on drugs. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reverses <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s certification, this would `` jeopardize further U.S.-Mexico cooperation and could lead to greater drug flows into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It could, in addition, seriously damage important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and political interests in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' he said. If adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the resolution could deprive <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of certain trade benefits and would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives in international lending institutions to vote against Mexican loan applications. In a brief statement Thursday night, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action as `` foreign interference'' in <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> affairs. `` No power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples,'' the statement said. Legislation to slap aid sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and four other Latin American countries also is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which would have to approve the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> resolution before it could become law. Even supporters of the bill conceded the measure has little likelihood of clearing all the hurdles, but said the symbolic value of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was enough. `` It's all rather academic,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., the bill's primary sponsor `` But by adopting this resolution, we will be sending a message to the government of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said close to 40 percent of the cocaine that enters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, making the 1,900-mile border between the two countries the No 1 entry point for narcotics. `` We've got to take off the gloves,'' he said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s attacks on his rivals have brought him more animosity than votes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, leaving his campaign seemingly stalled in the last days before Tuesday's primary, poll analysts say <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s Democratic opponents have solidified their support, surveys this week indicate, with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> retaining a comfortable lead over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a poor third. One poll indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may have overcome the weakness of support that plagued him in early contests. It said 67 percent of his support was strong, 9 points better than <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s in 1984, when <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> won the state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> maintained his powerful support among blacks, who make up about one-quarter of the Democratic primary vote, but was drawing only about 17 percent of the white vote and was splitting the Hispanic vote with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I think it's a two-person race. I do n't believe to date that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has made a mark,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frucher </PERSON>, a leading state political strategist. `` A lot of people feel turned off'' by <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign style, he said Two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> polls by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> appeared to support that view. One done April 5-6 said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was viewed unfavorably by 29 percent. One week of campaigning later, that was up to 36. `` Part of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s problem is an overwhelmingly negative reaction on the part of the black community,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, the Marist pollster. Nine percent of blacks rated <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> favorably, 50 percent unfavorably, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll also indicated <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was not drawing Jews from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, despite his aggressive effort to portray himself as more staunchly pro-Israel. `` The problem with the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> strategy among the Jews is that he was appealing to conservative Jewish Democrats. And those are called Republicans in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 70 percent of the Jewish vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 12 percent _ unchanged from the week before. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s favorable-unfavorable rating among Jews was 87-7; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s, 49-23. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday, before <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> launched a sharp midweek attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nuclear policy. <PERSON> Frucher </PERSON>, a close adviser to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, said he expected <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s newer moves to miss the mark. `` Negative works, do n't get me wrong. But it only works if you have a positive image,'' he said. `` And that just has n't been created.'' For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, widespread support among whites remained elusive. A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll Friday put his white support at 17 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> said 16 percent. Voters who are supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are doing so solidly; 82 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll said they backed him strongly. That would help him in a light turnout, when only the most committed voters show up at the polls. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll found 67 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' supporters were strongly behind him. A survey by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> found less strength for both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It said half <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' supporters were strong, compared to two-thirds of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll was done Wednesday night among 176 likely Democratic voters and had a margin of error of 8 points. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll was done Monday and Tuesday among 359 Democrats and had a 5-point error margin. The strength of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s support was flat _ 40 percent in the April 5-6 <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll, 41 percent in this week's survey. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll said 13 percent of likely Democratic voters were undecided or uncommitted; a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said 19 percent were uncommitted or undecided. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll, which was done Monday through Wednesday and had a 4-point error margin, had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 45 percent support, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 28 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 8. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had it as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 49, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 8. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 46 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 34 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 7. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, done Monday and Tuesday and with a 4-point error margin, had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 50 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 33, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 9.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> will not make a $ 5.7 million payment owed creditors next month and will lay off an additional 125 employees, the court-appointed trustee for the television ministry said today. Federal bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> also granted <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> more time to make revisions in its court-approved bankruptcy reorganization plan. Possible revisions to the plan include the sale of $ 3 million to $ 4 million of undeveloped land this year, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Other assets, including the Heritage Grand Hotel, could be sold as a last resort, he said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> must try to keep the television show on the air even without other `` non-essential assets'' such as the theme park, he said. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> until May 15 for the revisions after a hearing on a government motion to delay the May 2 implementation of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s court-approved plan In the motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys argued that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> remains on shaky ground with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking more than $ 55 million in back taxes. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization calls for the television ministry to repay more than $ 60 million in debts accumulated by former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appealed the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> reorganization plan on Dec. 29, and still opposes it.

<HEAD>Third Full-Scale Test-Firing Set Wednesday For Redesigned Shuttle
Booster</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The third full-scale test firing of the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket will be conducted Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said the 1 p.m. horizontal firing of the 126-foot-long rocket will last two minutes. The booster, 12 feet in diameter, contains 1.1 million pounds of propellant. During the second full-scale firing on Dec. 23, the rocket's NASA-designed nozzle boot ring broke apart The boot ring, about two inches thick, protects a flexible bearing that allows the nozzle to swivel and steer the rocket. Company officials said the test will incorporate the nozzle boot ring designed by <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> which performed successfully during the first full-scale test last August. Wednesday's firing, although the third of its kind at the <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> Operations test site, is the first of three required to qualify the new booster for flight. Subsequent tests are scheduled June 3 and July 6. The August and December tests evaluated primary and alternate elements of solid rocket motor design, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. He said the center field joint on the motor to be tested next week has been assembled with an `` intentional manufacturing-type flaw'' in the bonded insulation's J-seal. `` This defect may allow hot gases to penetrate the bonded insulation'' and reach an O-ring barrier, but <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> added that short-duration test firings with similar defects have shown that such defects tend to seal under motor pressure, preventing the release of gases. The escape of such super-hot gases from a <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> booster was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger and deaths of its seven crew members. The resumption of shuttle missions is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 4, although <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said technical problems could further delay the launch.

The filling station abuts the sparkling new marble-and-stone memorial at <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION>, the railroad siding which bordered the walled Jewish ghetto during the war. The monument is being dedicated Monday as part of elaborately planned observances marking the 45th anniversary of the doomed <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ghetto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, in which some of the last 70,000 inhabitants took up arms against the final Nazi eradication drive on April 19, 1943. Workmen were busily trying to complete the 20-yard-by-6-yard memorial this week, but whether the gas station next door will reopen in a few weeks remained unclear and a source of controversy. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON> said Thursday that official plans always have been to close down the the station once the monument was built. But <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Slawinski </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> branch of the state gasoline monopoly CPN, said the station will reopen after the anniversary ceremonies. He did not elaborate, but an official source demanding anonymity said the station `` will start operations again until another location is decided upon, and another station is built at the expense of those building the monument.'' According to the designer of the monument, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Szmalenberg </PERSON>, that is `` blackmail.'' `` It should n't be there,'' she said. `` No other important monument has a gas station nearby. It is insulting to the memory.'' She said the station should never have been constructed at the site and charged that putting it there in the first place was a `` political decision'' which stemmed from an anti-Semitic purge which took place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1968. Even though an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> donor has offered to pay for construction of a replacement gas station, she said, CPN has been holding out for more money. Ms. <PERSON> Szmalenberg </PERSON>, interviewed in the gas station lot Wednesday, said she designed the $ 252,000 monument as an enclosed rectangle in part because of the station's proximity. There often are long lines of cars at Polish gas stations, and idling vehicles just a few feet from the monument could be expected to disturb visitors, she said. In her design, she said, visitors will be able to step inside to partially avoid the fumes and the traffic noise. Visitors will enter under a sculpted arch. Inscribed on the walls inside are about 400 names, representing some of the victims who passed through <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION>. Previously, a small tablet marked the site. About 450,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding countryside were crowded into the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto after the 1939 Nazi occupation. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> enclosed the quarter with a barbed-wired-lined brick wall. The railroad siding at the tightly guarded square of <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION> _ German for `` deportation point'' _ was the only exit for 300,000 Jews, who there were loaded onto boxcars bound for the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Majdanek </LOCATION> death camps. Ms. <PERSON> Szmalenberg </PERSON> said she was skeptical of official promises that the station later would be shut down for good. The pumps have been taken down but the office has not been touched, standing only about a dozen yards from the monument. `` Even the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> authorities are not strong enough to get the gasoline people to change their mind,'' she said. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, asked about it on Tuesday, said, `` I really do n't understand _ and you must pardon me for this _ what the problem is, because it concerns some technical details.'' If the filling station poses an obstacle to the monument itself, `` then it goes without saying that it will be closed down for good,'' he said. But if the station is just an impediment to the ceremonies, `` it is a different matter.''

 Less than 24 hours after the signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Friday of trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply weapons to the Moslem insurgents. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is confirming its policy of neoglobalism, a course of export of counter-revolution,'' the news agency said in the first official Soviet press commentary issued since the signing of the pact in the Swiss city. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said private and public figures from various countries had hailed the agreement, which paves the way for the May 15 start of the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops now in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been reacting `` in a typical <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> manner.'' It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was interfering in Afghan-Soviet relations by insisting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stop its military aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they will continue aiding the guerrillas as long as Soviet military supplies to the regime of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> continue. Similar American interference continues in other regional conflicts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using `` illegal, unclean practices'' to bring about a situation favorable to itself, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed agreements in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Thursday pledging to guarantee Pakistani and Afghan observance of the settlement of the 10-year-old Afghan conflict. It said that if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> strictly observe the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement's prohibition against interference in each other's affairs, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s military support of the guerrillas, funneled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, `` will not have a decisive influence. However, a separate <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> commentary expressed concern about <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s position as stated by President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-Haq </PERSON>. `` The ink had n't dried on the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements, in which the sides obliged not to offer their territory for hostile actions against other countries, when the Pakistani president undertook to aid the mujahadeen in the struggle for the armed overthrow of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> administration.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It called the Pakistani position `` irresponsible.'' The mujahadeen guerrillas, based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have rejected the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements and vowed to drive the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government from power. The Soviets sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another. They stayed to help combat a nationwide insurgency. Also Friday, a Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the number of Soviet soldiers killed and injured in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be disclosed during the troop withdrawal. Spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told reporters at a regular news briefing that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had promised disclosure of the figures while in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the signing of the Afghan agreement. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> was asked at the briefing whether he believes Soviet citizens, who have never been informed of casualties during the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, have the right to know the full costs of the war. `` Of course,'' he replied. `` As far as concrete figures are concerned, as the foreign minister mentioned yesterday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the number of Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and other figures on that score, casualties, will be published simultaneously with the process of withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' Western officials estimate that at least 10,000 Soviets have been killed in the war, and about 25,000 wounded.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday that `` millions of dollars'' from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is helping Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to force him out of the country. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will go.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited `` several reliable sources'' for his information but did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> indicated he had no further information on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s allegation. The vice president labeled Democratic charges that the administration had propped up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as `` demagogic statements'' and declared: `` It is this administration that has brought <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice, or at least taken the first step.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only remaining rival for the Republican presidential nomination, told the same audience that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s popularity stemmed almost entirely from his association with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was regarded as ` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the Second,''' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. He acknowledged there was no way to deny <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. `` It is obvious from the delegate count that has come out that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be the nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> absent any unexpected eventuality,'' the former television minister said. About his own camapign, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` I really do n't think looking now at the results that anything made any difference. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran a superb campaign. And I had no conception that he had adopted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mantle in so total a way.'' Still, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> indicated he was not ready to abandon his effort, saying he hoped to `` energize the people who support me'' to play a role in the GOP convention in August. However, he said he would support the party nominee in November. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who withdrew from the race earlier this month, said he was ready to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before the convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had lunch in the Capitol Friday with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators and former senators, including White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. In a unity meeting staged for television cameras and reporters, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood side-by-side behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s desk and said they were ready to work together. `` Yes, we had differences, some would say shades of differences,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. But `` we're ready to go to work for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in turn, said `` Nobody possibly could have been more gracious than <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned a private meeting later in the day at his residence with former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The vice president opened his speech by greeting `` the editors of the nation's finest newspapers _ and also those who publish Doonesbury,'' a lighthearted reference to the syndicated comic strip by G.B. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> that frequently has poked fun at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In a speech that focused on foreign policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the administration's efforts to `` protect civilian rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' `` So far he has stood up to the considerable economic pressures we have applied, and I can tell you one reason why,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Several reliable sources indicate that he is receiving millions of dollars in support from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' Later, at a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> briefing, spokesman <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s allegations. He shrugged his shoulders, indicating that he had no information on the matter. However, last month it was reported that a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> defense force major who defected told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that he had been sent to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in early March to pick up a $ 50 million payment for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but that the funds were never transferred. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reiterated his contention that he did not know about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drugs until the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader's indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in March `` In terms of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, those are the facts,'' he said. In response to a question, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that the administration is `` purusing every lead, going down every rabbit trail, running into dead ends'' in efforts to free hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' Middle East correspondent `` There are n't any easy answers,'' he said, suggesting that poor intelligence-gathering in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is making it difficult `` even to find where these people are.''

<TEXT>
 Contra rebel leaders returning to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday, some after years in exile, can expect to find considerably more misery but not many tangible changes in their capital. The trip by the directorate of the Miami-based Nicaraguan Resistance was to further work started last month to reach a lasting cease-fire and end more than six years of civil war. Just a few months back such a visit seemed impossible. But haggling and compromise on both sides, coupled with a need to end the grueling war, made the trip a necessity. The Contras 45-member delegation will find that the leftist Sandinistas still maintain a firm control on the day-to-day workings of the government, although their popularity has slipped. The capital still is dusty and hot this time of year, though increased poverty and population are evident. Vast open lots left barren since the 1972 earthquake have not been filled. The walls of homes and buildings bear pro-Sandinista and Marxist grafitti. A steep hillside bears the initials of the Sandinista party. A large black iron statue in a downtown plaza shows a fighter with one fist in the air, the other arm raised and holding a Soviet-designed AK-47 rifle. Red-and-black Sandinista flags fly everywhere. Thousands of people, most from the rural north, flooded into the capital and its environs to escape the ravages of war. <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> is home to about a third of the nation's population of 3 million. Wooden shacks sit in dusty lots. Water has been rationed for the past few years. Some neighborhoods do without for as little as two days a week, while others receive water only a few hours per week. There are shortages of everything from spare parts for cars to the basics of rice and beans. Discontent was on the rise earlier this year because of the economic conditions, the scarcities and the mandatory draft. But attitudes changed last month when the cease-fire talks made it seem that peace could be a reality. The mood in the capital has been one of guarded hope, with most residents acknowledging there never has been a point so close to ending the war. The Contra delegation was headed by the Resistance's board, made up of <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>. All of the directorate members, except for Ms. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, come from upper crust Nicaraguan families. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> went into exile in 1982 and was the political head of the largest <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> group, the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He holds a law degree and headed the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He opposed the former government of dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, ousted by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. But he later called the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> a group of Marxists. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where he was responsible for Contra logistics. He is considered a stauch nationalist and a pragmatic and sensible negotiator. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 and after the revolution became executive director of the International Construction Fund. He also served as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1982, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were Marxists, and moved to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He worked with the government there and later joined the Contras operating on the southern front. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, whose family owns the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, went into exile in 1984. His brother, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, is editor of the Sandinista newspaper Barricada. One of his sisters is the ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> was the latest to join the directorate, having stayed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> until last year. She was staunchly opposed to <ORGANIZATION> Somoza </ORGANIZATION> and reportedly aided some of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> during their guerrilla campaign against him. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, she comes from a middle-class family and became a vocal internal Sandinista critic.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan to Boost Capital Spending 8 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Businesses plan to increase capital spending by 8 percent this year, the government reported Friday, raising hopes that manufacturers will expand factory capacity enough to ease long-term inflation pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies expect to spend $ 419.9 billion, after adjustments for inflation, on expansion and modernization this year. If realized, that would be the best gain since a 9.6 percent rise in 1985. Businesses spent $ 388.7 billion last year, a 1.7 percent increase over 1986. The new estimate for 1988, based on a survey completed in March, represented an increase over a survey finished in November, when businesses said they planned to spend 7.3 percent more. `` That's good for inflation in the longer term,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That added capacity helps meet demand. ... If they were n't increasing their capital spending, I'd worry.'' A separate report by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, showing wholesale prices advancing at a 7 percent annual rate, renewed inflation fears among investors. Adding to the concern is the fact that the operating rate at factories, at 82.4 percent of capacity in February, is the highest in eight years. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> plans to release data for March on Monday. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-area forecasting firm, said if businesses follow through on their plans, they will be able to produce more. `` Most of the capital spending that companies are involved in is for equipment, a lot of it for replacing older, less-efficient equipment that they had been using for years ... In the long run, it's very positive for improving productivity,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. The capital spending survey also eases fears running in the other direction _ that dampened consumer demand would lead to a recession this year. Economists are looking to manufacturing for export and capital spending to keep the economy growing. The cheaper dollar is creating more demand overseas for U.S.-manufactured goods and capital spending is increasing so factories can meet that demand. In 1986, investment spending fell by 2.6 percent as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies battled stiff foreign competition. For 1988, manufacturing firms expected to boost spending by 8.9 percent, after a 1.1 percent increase last year. The anticipated growth this year includes a 6.5 percent boost by firms making durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, and an 11.2 percent advance at companies making non-durable goods. Non-manufacturing industries projected an increase in investment spending of 7.5 percent, with mining, transportation, utility and other commercial firms all expecting gains. Utility companies predicted the smallest increase in 1988, 1.9 percent, after a 0.6 percent drop in spending in 1987.

<HEAD>Widow Wins Early Round In Battle To Cash In 50-Year-Old Cuban
Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An elderly widow has won the first round in her legal battle against a bank and the government to cash in $ 127,000 worth of half-century-old bonds issued by the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The ruling led the woman's lawyer to wonder what happened to the millions of dollars that should have been in a bank account to back the $ 1,000-face-value bonds. It also has fueled speculation in the bonds. The 1937 $ 85 million bond issue matured in 1977. Manufacturers Hanover Trust of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was an indentured trustee for part of the bond issue, meaning the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government contracted to pay a set amount to Manufacturers Hanover, which would pay the bondholders. The government of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> stopped making payments in 1960. When <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, 77, of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, applied to Manufacturers Hanover in early 1987 to redeem the bonds, which she inherited from her mother, the bank refused. The federal Office of Foreign Assets Control told her the bank was correct in refusing to redeem the bonds, because they were considered frozen under the Trading with the Enemy Act. Mrs. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> filed suit in September, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> ruled March 13 that she was entitled to the money because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unreasonably considered all the bonds, even those held by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents, as frozen assets. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> resident should n't be stopped from seeking payment from an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institution, the judge decreed. `` This court recognizes the importance of providing the president with flexibility in his negotiations with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may only use those assets that are not property of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> residents,'' he wrote in his order. Attorneys for the government and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> asked to delay payment to Mrs. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> pending a decision on whether to appeal. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Arandia </PERSON>, filed a counter motion asking that they pay immediately. No court date has been set on the motions. `` There's many unidentified holders of these bonds. ... We do n't know who they are,'' <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroeger </PERSON>, an attorney for the bank, told the judge Estimating there are $ 44 million in bonds in circulation in this country, the bank says there is only about $ 1.5 million in the fund to pay off bondholders. <PERSON> Arandia </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s lawyer, said he wants a full accounting of the bond fund, arguing that according to the payment schedule, the bank should have received $ 40 million by 1960. Although the bond issue was to mature in 1977, <PERSON> Arandia </PERSON> said that as far as he can determine his client appears to be the first to ever try to redeem any of the bonds, meaning the question of whether they could be redeemed had never been asked before. `` It's very strange,'' he said Friday of the entire case. The federal Office of Foreign Assets Control was not happy with the judge's ruling. `` The court's decision could become a vehicle enabling <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to obtain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars,'' said agency spokesman <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Newcombe </PERSON>. In the meantime, speculators have been snapping up the old bonds and trading them on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with hopes of a thaw in relations between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>' ruling, the bonds traded for $ 200, but a week later they traded for $ 450.

 The artistic freedom fostered by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> brought the work of Spanish surrealist <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> out of a `` zone of silence'' to Soviets for the first time Friday, the head of the host museum said. <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonova </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pushkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s nightmarish style in sculpture, painting and graphics had been off limits in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The creative work of the surrealists, including <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> to some extent, belonged to a zone of silence of such themes of art that were closed until recent times,'' said <PERSON> Antonova </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` glasnost'' policy of more openness has encouraged intellectuals and artists to explore previously forbidden themes in their work, and <PERSON> Antonova </PERSON> said the display of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s work represents a break from conservative policies of Soviet museums. `` Very many blank spots in literature, art and cinematography are being opened for our audiences,'' she said. `` And I would assume that the work of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> now should be placed in that context.'' Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Soviet media blasted <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> as decadent and degenerate and did not publish any reproductions of his work. The Pushkin Museum kicked off its display of 160 Dali graphics and a few sculptures from the collection of Frenchman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Argillet </PERSON> with private showings for Soviet and foreign journalists and for invited dignitaries such as government officials. The one-month exhibition opens to the public Saturday, but people began lining up Friday during a snowstorm in hopes of getting into the museum, a few blocks from the Kremlin. They were told tickets wo n't go on sale until Saturday. Long lines are common at most cultural events involving foreign artists. <PERSON> Antonova </PERSON> bristled when asked if it would be difficult for people to get tickets. `` They will get tickets just like everywhere, as in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, people will stand at the cashier's booth, buy tickets and go to the exhibit,'' she said, declining to say how many people would be allowed to view the exhibit daily. Argillet, 78, said Soviet officials became interested in his collection of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s sketches after musicians from the Soviet Conservatory and dancers from the Kirov and Bolshoi ballets saw the works in the Frenchman's home, the <ORGANIZATION> Chateau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penil </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Melun </LOCATION>, 24 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He signed a contract for the <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> exhibition in October with the Soviet Culture Ministry. Argillet, a publisher of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s works, said the 84-year-old artist is in poor health in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and could n't attend the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> showing, but would be pleased it was taking place. Some Soviets said they regretted that the exhibition was limited to <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s etchings and drawings from the 1960s and did not include his better-known and more colorful paintings.

<HEAD>Students Walk Out When Squad Drops Black Majorette</HEAD>

 High school administrators have promised to review the way drum majorettes are chosen after 25 to 30 students staged a walkout when the squad's first and only black member was dropped. The students chanted `` We want Mazy'' as they left classes at <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for about an hour Thursday in the school and were joined at a schoolyard fence by 10 to 15 parents. <PERSON> Mazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruise </PERSON>, 15, a sophomore, has been a majorette for the past two years, but did not make the squad for the 1988-89 school year. She is the 10-member squad's first and only black member. `` All of the kids in the band felt Mazy was highly qualified to return to the majorette group,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a parent. `` I feel I've been treated unfairly,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruise </PERSON>, the only black to try out for the 1988-89 squad. She said she was touched when she saw that parents and students gathered at the fence to protest the decision. The school's enrollment of 1,000 students is 17 percent black. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a guidance counselor who is serving as acting principal, met with students and parents at the Thursday protest. After complaints that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruise </PERSON> had been unfairly treated, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed to review `` the whole situation concerning Mazy'' and the school's policies for majorette selection. The walkout `` did not totally disrupt the school,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Students returned to school after missing just one class Thursday, and the school day went on normally on Friday, she said. Students who tried out for the majorette squad last month did dance and twirling routines and then were ranked by scores tallied by four judges, all white. Two of the judges were from dance studios and two were former majorettes. Mazy was ranked 11th of the 14 students who tried out. Ten were chosen. `` I've been twirling since I was 6. ... I'm not bragging, but I'm better than all of them,'' Miss <PERSON> Ruise </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tajuana </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 16, who participated in the protest, agreed that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruise </PERSON> had been treated unfairly. `` They knew she was good,'' she said.

 The percentage of adults who say they are going out less because of economic concerns has doubled in the last five months, but consumers are spending more on gourmet food to enjoy their evenings in, according to a nationwide survey. Thirty-two percent of 500 adults around the country questioned last week by a consulting company said they are staying home more since last fall, because of the economy. <ORGANIZATION> Decision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s first poll of 3,500 people in November and December found only 16 percent staying home more often `` Many people are focusing on their own household and their personal finances,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a research consultant at the Lexington-based firm. `` But also the level of concern about the overall economy has not dropped off.'' On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating most concern, an average of 6.38 was registered in April among respondents asked about the state of the national economy, compared with 6.23 last fall. Concern for the global economy ranked 5.73 in the recent survey and 5.79 last fall. Parents under 40 years old earning less than $ 40,000 annually were most likely to stay at home. Only 7 percent of older respondents with yearly incomes over $ 40,000 indicated they are staying home more, she said. `` Having made the point that the anxiety level about the economy has not diminished, people are also stating clearly that they have changed their behavior patterns,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> survey, launched several weeks after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market collapse, has spanned a period in which real estate markets softened in some areas and several economists offered predictions of a return to inflation or recession. While 9 percent of respondents last year said they had changed plans regarding major expenditures such as homes and vacations because of economic worries, the number rose to 17 percent in <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION>'s April survey <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> undertook the study on its own and sells results to manufacturers and marketing firms interested in gauging consumer trends. `` I think the people particularly interested is the leisure and home food industry,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` There seems to be an impact in fancy foods and takeout food. It fits in with the ` couch potato' trend, but if people are going to stay at home they do n't want to just vegetate `` They want fun things to do. It seems there will be a significant impact in home entertainment, kids' games, books.'' A <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> report issued last month indicated only 12 percent of 1,000 adults questioned said watching television was their principal evening activity. Most told <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> pollsters they combine television viewing with other activities, such as cooking, cleaning and doing crafts, said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. In the April survey, two-thirds of respondents reported that their spending habits have changed since last fall. Items being purchased more include gourmet food and home improvement gadgets. On the decline are clothing, standard food and `` even 2 percent said they were cutting back on necessity items,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` It seems to be that people are saying, ` Well, if I'm going to be staying home, I'm going to have fancier food or more enjoyable things to do,''' she said.

<HEAD>Four Die in Rioting to Protest Higher Gasoline Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said six people died during a violent demonstration against increases in gasoline prices, the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Police said they used force to quell a riot that had degenerated into `` complete lawlessness.'' Nigerian newspapers had reported Thursday that police shot four people to death in the northern city of <PERSON> Jos </PERSON>. Authorities closed half a dozen colleges and universities, including the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lagos </ORGANIZATION>, to halt the spread of protests. The Plateau state police command said the dead included a police constable and a retired police inspector, the news agency said. `` The command unequivocally believes that it will not allow a situation where there is a complete breakdown of law and order, resulting in a state of anarchy,'' according to the police statement. The statement also confirmed that rioters burned down two court buildings, a metropolitan development board building, police station, local government secretariat and the state fire office. Police blocked rioters from burning down the city's main market, a bank and divisional police headquarters, the statement said. The news agency said businesses had reopened in <PERSON> Jos </PERSON> and life was returning to normal Friday. Gasoline prices were raised 3 percent last weekend by the military government, which is under pressure from Western creditors to raise money to meet a $ 1.5 billion budget deficit. Although the price increases appear small, transport companies subsequently raised bus prices from 50 percent to 100 percent in some areas. Since the oil boom days of the mid-1970s, Nigerians have come to regard cheap gasoline as a fundamental right. Even with the increases, gasoline costs about 40 cents a gallon.

 For 50 years people have wondered: Did <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> ever get back together, or was it all over for the tempestuous lovers of `` Gone With the Wind'' when <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> walked out the door. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> never told, and now the answer is up to <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> author chosen by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s estate to write the sequel to the Civil War-era epic Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> is n't saying what she'll do, but her novel appears certain to be a multimillion-dollar production that the luxury-loving <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> would have appreciated. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which is handling the book for the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> estate, said publishers are reading the first two chapters this week and next and will bid on the book at an auction in a week to 10 days. It is to be published in 1990. `` I just ca n't talk price because we just do n't know,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> agency, who represents Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>. But he said the auction price was sure to be `` in a substantial multiple of millions.'' Life magazine predicted it could hit $ 6 million. Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> told Life, which has contracted to run excerpts of the sequel, that she will take about 18 months to write the 1,000-page, still-untitled book. `` This one will never be mine,'' she said. `` It's a foster mother kind of thing. I am trying to prepare myself for a universal hatred of what I'm going to do. Yes, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> writes better than I do _ but she's dead.'' Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who was killed by an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> taxi in 1949, refused to write a sequel to her 1936 novel, saying the story had reached its `` natural and proper ending.'' But her estate announced last year that it had begun work on an authorized novel continuing the tale of <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON>. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, an attorney for the estate, said <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the author's brother, reluctantly agreed before his death in 1983 that the family must proceed with the book to prevent a flood of unauthorized sequels when the `` Gone With the Wind'' copyright expires in 2011. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said Friday that he was pleased with the selection of Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> from a dozen authors. `` Of course, we're prejudiced down here in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>,'' he said, `` and I think <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> herself realizes she may not measure up _ indeed she said so. But having said that, in our day and time I think she is an extremely talented lady and will do the most credible sequel that we could come out with.'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said the family will give Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> a free hand, although the estate set broad guidelines for the book and has a right to refuse her manuscript if she steps outside those parameters. `` We did n't want any hilariously raw sex,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, native who wants to keep her current hometown in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> a secret, promised there wo n't be any. She told Life she will write more openly about sex than <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> did, but `` I do n't do graphic descriptions of what people do to one another. It makes me snicker.'' She said she also will not imitate the thick slave dialect of the original because `` I find it hard to read, and black people find it demeaning.'' Although Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> is keeping her plot secret, she suggested <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON>'s hometown, would figure in the sequel. `` Can you imagine <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> in old <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>?'' she asked in an interview with The -LRB- <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> -RRB- News and <PERSON> Courier </PERSON>. `` Can you see her and <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> going to the St. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>? Hmmmmmm. ` Oh, fiddlededee, who IS that strange person?' I just do n't see how I can resist having a little touch of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> in the book!'' Ms. <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, 54, grew up in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Braid </PERSON> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on a scholarship from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daughters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederacy </ORGANIZATION>. She has written four historical novels, `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, `` On Leaving <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>,'' `` New Orleans Legacy'' and `` The Time Returns.''

 The execution of <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a participant in the largest escape of condemned prisoners in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, leaves three of the six inmates who fled the <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 still on death row. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>, 33, was put to death late Thursday night after final appeals to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a stay and to Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> for clemency were turned down. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>, who said he lived a troubled childhood that included beatings by his father and sexual abuse by his stepmother, was sentenced to die for robbing and killing a neighbor, <PERSON> Wilhelmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in November 1980. The 38-year-old victim, a <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> school librarian, was strangled, stabbed and robbed of $ 8. Before he died, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> expressed remorse for the murder, said <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrion </PERSON>, a Washington-based reporter for <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> television who interviewed <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> just hours before the execution. `` He said he felt sorry for strangling the woman,'' said <PERSON> Carrion </PERSON>. `` He was very articulate. He showed no fear of dying, but he felt apprehensive, obviously.'' During the trial, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> had denied killing the woman, saying he got blood on his clothing because he had tried to help defend her against two intruders. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> and five other death row inmates staged a daring escape from prison on May 31, 1984. All six were recaptured within a month, with <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> being one of the first two caught as they were drinking wine and eating cheese outside a coin laundry in <LOCATION> Warrenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Two of the escapees, brothers <PERSON> Linwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Briley </PERSON>, were executed before <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>. The other three _ <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Derick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuggle </PERSON> _ are still on death row. Previous executions at the aging State Penitentiary in downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, slated to close within two years, have attracted rowdy crowds of death penalty supporters who yelled epithets at prayer vigil groups opposed to capital punishment. But the scene Thursday night was subdued. About 75 death penalty foes held a candlelight vigil and sang `` We Shall Overcome.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagnoni </PERSON>, who spoke to the group, suggested that <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s use of executions was racist. `` When we use the death penalty, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is in a state of apartheid, like in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pagnoni </PERSON>, director of a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> shelter for the homeless. Since 1982, seven death sentences have been carried out in the state. All of the condemned were men; five of the seven were black, including <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s death brings to 98 the number of persons executed since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to restore the death penalty in 1976. Five of the executions have taken place this year.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reacted angrily Friday to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to impose trade and economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for not doing enough to fight the drug trade. However, Mexican officials expressed confidence that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto the sanctions if they are passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote an `` intervention'' and said in a formal protest `` no power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples.'' On Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> actually could lead to an increase in such traffic. `` Far from serving as a catalyst for action, this vote castigates a friend for less than perfect behavior,'' department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The Mexican government places the fight against the drug trade under the joint command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Federal Attorney General's Office. It also cooperates with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains an office and agents here. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decision did not surprise Mexican officials, but many said they were disappointed. Mexican officials have often been singled out in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by politicians and news media as corrupt and accused of participating in or permitting drug traffic. The Attorney General's Office, which says it has lost more than 30 agents in battles with drug traffickers in the past three years, issued a stronger statement saying the sacrifice of those who lost their lives `` does not appear to interest those who condemn an effort they are ignorant of or prefer to remain ignorant of.'' It said thousands of Mexicans risk their lives fighting the drug trade and added, `` All of this is not understood by those who should recognize the work that our country has undertaken to protect the lives and health of our own population and of other communities, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Mexican officials have tried in the past to avoid direct confrontation and the exchange of recriminations about who does more in the fight against drug trafficking.

<HEAD>Education Group: Textbooks Full Of Trivia, Faddism, Inconsistency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most textbooks are lifeless and boring because state regulations force publishers to cram elementary and secondary books with `` test-oriented trivia, pedagogical faddism and inconsistent social messages,'' an education group charged Friday. The Council for Basic Education said states should stop issuing lengthy list of what textbooks must cover, and publishers should have textbooks written by gifted writers instead of committee. In a study called `` A Conspiracy of Good Intentions: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Textbook Fiasco,'' the non-profit council said the textbook selection system `` is perfectly designed to produce textbooks that confuse, mislead and profoundly bore students. `` Authors and editors do not willingly chop and flatten sentences, nor do they thoughtlessly mangle storylines,'' it said. `` The source of the writing problem is not in the publishing house, but in the public agency. Legislators, educational policymakers and administrative regulators have unintentionally drained the life out of children's textbooks.'' It cited one book that rendered the fable of `` The Hare and the Tortoise'' this way: `` Rabbit said: ` I can run. I can run fast. You ca n't run fast.' <PERSON> Turtle </PERSON> said, ` Look Rabbit. See the park. You and I will run. We'll run to the park.' `` Rabbit said, ` I want to stop. I'll stop here. I can run, but Turtle ca n't.' `` ` I can get to the park fast.' <PERSON> Turtle </PERSON> said, ` I ca n't run fast. But I will not stop. Rabbit ca n't see me. I'll get to the park.''' In another instance noted in a recent article in <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION> magazine, a passage from <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s `` The Emperor's New Clothes'' was reduced from the original: `` ` Magnificent!' ` Excellent!' ` Prodigious!' went from mouth to mouth, and everyone was exceedingly pleased.'' To this: `` ` How marvelous,' they echoed the emperor. ` How beautiful.''' The council said the entire market is hostage to the textbook adoption method that 22 states use to decide which books their public schools can buy. Most Southern and Western states, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, have such adoption policies. States churn out `` undisciplined lists of particulars that publishers must include in the textbooks. Since publishers must sell in as many jurisdictions as possible in order to turn a profit, their books must incorporate this melange of test-oriented trivia, pedagogical faddism and inconsistent social messages,'' the study said. `` The harder they try to regulate the content of textbooks, the less useful textbooks become for their own students and students elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the study. The author, <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson-Bernstein </PERSON>, said `` readability'' formulas used to judge whether a text is too far over children's heads are partly to blame for the poor prose `` Another pervasive textbook sin is ` mentioning' ... textbook prose that fits from fact to fact, statement to statement, and topic to topic, without giving the reader the context that would make sense of the factual information,'' the study said. The study recommended adoption states stop `` issuing detailed, skill-oriented bid specifications to publishers,'' abandon the readability formulas and stop demanding a recent publication date, which `` forces publishers into hasty revisions.'' It recommended publishers hire authors `` who have demonstrated their ability to write clear and engaging text for mass audiences,'' and that they pay scholars, not public school teachers or education professors, to get the textbooks. <PERSON> Tyson-Bernstein </PERSON>, at a briefing for reporters here on Wednesday, said textbooks `` are too condensed and too compressed ... They are useful to teachers now, but not very useful to students.'' Teachers rely heavily on the textbooks in preparing instruction, she said. She discussed her findings Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The average public school district spent $ 4,000 per child in 1980, but only $ 34.17 on instructional materials, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>. The council is a three-decade-old group that advocates a liberal arts curriculum for all students in elementary and secondary schools.

 Eighty young people boarded buses Friday to escape _ at least for the 10 days of their mountain retreat _ the turfs of the gangs that bring violence and drugs to their urban neighborhoods. `` The thing I want to get out of this is to better my life,'' 15-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said as he waited to board one of the three buses going to the <LOCATION> Pocono </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Nearly all the 15 - to 20-year-olds taking part in the `` Youth at Risk'' program have been suspended from school at some point, and about 30 are serious gang members, said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, director of community outreach and enrollment for the program On Thursday, the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> issued a report that said gang violence will soon make organized crime family activities seem tame. The retreat at a camp near <LOCATION> Bushwick </LOCATION> will included hikes along with individual and group counseling. Some of the young people said they hoped to learn to control their tempers or do better in school. `` I want to keep from getting locked up,'' said 16-year-old <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouie </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> has run the `` Youth at Risk'' for <ORGANIZATION> Breakthrough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for eight years and said its programs have been succesful in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and other cities. This is the first time the program has been offered in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We're going to demand everything you've got, and when you think you're out of gas, we're going to demand more,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> warned Friday morning. He asked the youths to refrain from venting their anger with violence. `` You are in a room full of people with short fuses,'' he said. `` This is going to be 10 days of peace. ... It's called growing up.'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the youths were required to turn in any drugs, weapons, radios and snack food before they can participate. `` What I'm telling you is put down your arms. Put down your anger. Put down your hatred,'' he said. The youths appeared upset by only two of the rules: no snacking between meals and no music except when the staff provides radios. <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swans </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said the program's goal was to relieve tension and despair among <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s youths caused by high unemployment and an increased high school dropout rate. Swans said the same type of hopelessness caused gang violence resulting in a death a week during gang wars in the late 1960s and early 1970s. `` All the problems we had to deal with 20 years ago, we still have to deal with,'' said Swans, himself a veteran of the city's gang wars <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said her 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, came to her with the idea of participating in the retreat. `` He just felt like he wants to get away and sit down and think about what he wants to do in the future,'' she said. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said about $ 300,000 was raised for the program, which will have 100 volunteers at the site in the <LOCATION> Poconos </LOCATION> and hold monthly meetings for a year after the retreat. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, took the course in 1986 when he was a junior in high school and selling cocaine. `` Some guys wanted to get me. My money was n't coming straight. My parents wanted to throw me out of the house. I was flunking out. My life was n't working,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the group. After the course, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, he took a job and finished high school. `` I got dreams now,'' added <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who is spending a year working with `` Youth at Risk.''

 An additional 325,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The sale, equal to about 11.9 million bushels, was handled by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000; <ORGANIZATION> Artfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the grain was sold under terms of the long-term grain agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the subsidies averaged $ 24.70 per ton, or about 67 cents per bushel of wheat. No selling prices were announced, but wheat has been averaging about $ 2.84 per bushel recently, according to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. That could mean a farm value of about $ 50 million. The U.S.-Soviet pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets are required to seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval. The Soviets were given approval to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. So far, the Soviets have bought more than 8.8 million tons of subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year, as well as 4.1 million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal. Subsidies are provided under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive world prices. The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $ 20 to more than $ 40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $ 1.09 per bushel. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the Soviets have more than 185,000 tons remaining in their current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization. An additional 1 million tons were announced on April 4, plus some left over from earlier authorizations.

<HEAD>Critics Want Human Rights Attached to Creation of `Zone of Trust'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Czechoslovak human rights group has called on its government to release all political prisoners and allow free travel abroad before a government-proposed `` zone of trust'' is created in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` If trust is not to remain a mere propagandistic slogan, certain basic preconditions must be fulfilled for it to emerge,'' said the appeal from the Charter 77 group. A text was released Friday through the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newsletter. The document was signed by three Charter 77 spokesmen and issued in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on April 11. It welcomed a Czechoslovak government proposal to set up a `` zone of trust and good neighborly relations along the dividing lines of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries'' in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> made the proposal in February, but no details have been made public. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> officials said the buffer zone, to include such countries as West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, would cover cultural, military, ecological and human relations issues. The Charter 77 appeal calls on the Czechoslovak government to prove its `` trustworthiness and credibility by respecting the fundamental rights and liberties of its citizens while submitting itself to open and public scrutiny.'' A copy was sent to <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and to the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> follow-up Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, As reported by <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, signatories <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bohumir </PERSON> <PERSON> Janat </PERSON> specifically demanded the immediate release of <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who is serving a six-year sentence for publishing information on conditions in Czechoslovak prisons. He was jailed in 1983. They also demanded that priest <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Javorsky </PERSON>, sentenced to eight months in jail last year for celebrating Mass without official permission, be set free. The appeal also demanded freedom to travel abroad, in particular to the couuntries included in the proposed trust zone; an end to discrimination against nonconformist citizens; and a halt to persecuting human rights groups. `` If the government does not take decisive steps in the spirit of the above-mentioned points, its peace proposal will remain a mere empty gesture,'' the signatories of the appeal said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Rice Exports Could Blossom in Face of World Supply Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American rice farmers may benefit in the early months of the 1988-89 season from a shortage of exportable crops in competing nations, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Friday. World rice production from the 1987-88 harvests is forecast at 304 million metric tons, milled equivalent, down 4 percent from last year, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Weak monsoons left <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> producers with limited supplies. Meanwhile, global rice consumption is expected to increase 3 percent, leaving world stockpiles at their lowest level relative to use since 1974. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice supply also has tightened, reflecting a 6 percent reduction in last year's harvest. But the department's planting survey in early March indicated <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers intend to boost 1988 rice plantings by 19 percent to 2.8 million acres. That could boost this year's output sharply. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers will harvest rice crops at least four months ahead of their <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> competitors,'' the report said. `` Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be the major source of supply during those months, some increased export opportunities may exist towards the end of 1988.'' However, analysts cautioned that some foreign importers, if possible, may `` choose to wait until the beginning of 1989, when prices are likely to decline during the Asian harvest.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Lengthens Delegate Lead With `Super Delegates' Help</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has expanded his delegate lead to 112 over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with the help of support from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> elected as delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Most of the 237 senators and representatives picked so far to have votes at the convention have not announced their choices. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the early leader Friday in the battle for support from congressional `` super delegates.'' In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so far: _ Twenty-six of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats nominated to be delegates are backing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, while 15 are supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, according to a survey by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> has 12 in his corner and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has suspended active campaigning, has 10. _ Nine of the 32 senators picked so far as delegates have endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 5 senator-delegates and <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> 2, including themselves. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has none. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose campaign strategy is pegged on putting at least 250 delegates between himself and second-place <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the next few weeks, already has gained 100 toward that goal during the past week. On Wednesday, he won the endorsement of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s governor, who delivered himself and 51 other previously uncommitted delegates as a bloc. For sheer size, the congressional caucuses rank behind only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in terms of the number of delegates being sent to the convention. The two houses next week complete the selection of 251 senators and representatives as delegates. In both houses, the delegate nominations are supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership, and next week's party caucuses are expected to be little more than ceremonial. But the delegates' choices are still generally unknown. Overall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 842.15 delegates, some 100 of whom are `` super delegates,'' the party leaders and politicians _ including members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ who are being sent as delegates to the convention because of offices they hold or held. In all, 644 of these delegates, who are free to make or dissolve their commitments to presidential candidates as they see fit, are to attend the convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are super delegates, as is <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who dropped out of the presidental race last month. The remaining 85 percent of the delegates to the convention, 3,518, are getting there through the primaries or caucuses, in which they are required to pledge themselves to support a presidential candidate or declare that they are uncommitted. Although, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' delegate lead is becoming formidable, his total represents just 40 percent of the 2,082 delegates needed to win the party's presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose landslide victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on March 26 momentarily pushed him into the lead in delegates, now has 730.1 delegates in the AP count. That includes 45 super delegates. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 411.55 delegates, including 41 super delegates, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has 183.5 delegates overall, including 28.5 super delegates. More than 600 delegates are uncommitted, including about 400 from the ranks of the party's political professionals.

<HEAD>Lawyers Request Reopening Trial For Six Blacks On Death Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawyers on Friday filed an application seeking to reopen the trial of six blacks who were sentenced to hang in a case that drew worldwide protests. The court action came a day after six other blacks were hung at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison, raising to 50 the number of executions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year. The application on behalf of the so-called <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six was filed in <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. It is not known how soon a decision on the request will be made. The five men and one women were convicted of complicity in the mob killing of a black town councilor during anti-apartheid riots that broke out in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, in September 1984. The violence touched off two years of nationwide unrest. The six were scheduled to die on March 18, but a stay of execution was granted to allow time for defense lawyers to request the case be reopened. The stay was decreed because of evidence that a state witness committed perjury during the original trial. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had previously rejected international appeals to grant clemency to the six, saying he did not want to interfere in the judicial process. The six were not accused of contributing physically to the death of <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> councilor <PERSON> Kuzwayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlamini </PERSON>. They were convicted under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which held them responsible because they were part of the mob that killed the man. The government has argued that the Sharpville Six are being falsely portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law. Authorities say evidence in the trial showed that each played an active part in the killing, through such alleged actions as making firebombs to burn <PERSON> Dhlamini </PERSON>'s house or slapping a woman who pleaded for the councilor's life. The six men hung Thursday included two blacks in their 20s described by authorities as `` comrades,'' a term commonly used to describe anti-apartheid militants. They were convicted of killing two other black men by setting fire to oil-soaked tires placed around the victims' necks. One of the executed men was convicted of killing a mixed-race man, while the other three were hung for murdering elderly whites. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> formally requested congressional approval Friday for a $ 2 billion co-production deal that would allow <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to build M-1A1 Abrams tanks. The arms transaction, disclosed several months ago by administration officials, calls for the sale of 555 M-1A1 tanks. As many as 540 of them could be built on a new assembly line to be constructed in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will now have 30 days to veto the deal should it wish to do so. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in notifying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it had approved the transaction, argued <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> `` needs an advanced tank to ensure the stability of the existing regional military balance, especially vis-a-vis <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' `` The sale of this equipment and support will not adversely affect the basic military balance in the region,'' the Pentagon said. `` This sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by helping to improve the security of a friendly country which has been and continues to be an important force for stability and peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would be responsible for overseeing the transaction and that the prime contractor would be the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>End of Season Ratings: Bad News and Confusion for Networks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> says it came in second in the television ratings for the season according to the ratings company <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION>, although <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> results used by all three networks have <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> finishing third for the first time ever. No matter whose figures are used, the end of season ratings released by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Friday show that viewers are no longer enchanted by its new shows and are turning instead to VCRs, cable and independent stations, and perhaps even books, conversation or exercise. CBS apparently suffered most. Except for `` Beauty and the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' it could count no new shows as successes, even though `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' `` Wiseguy'' and `` Tour of Duty'' received critical praise. `` We are not, as some people would expect, going to fall on our swords in defeat,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing, who briefed reporters on the end-of-season results. `` We are not defeatists.'' The networks' prime-time season does n't officially end until Sunday, but the last week's results are n't expected to change the picture. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Entertainment President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> is to have a session with reporters Monday, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which will win its third season in a row, is holding an end-of-season briefing Tuesday. CBS held its briefing early perhaps because it is already conceding it will come in third for the first time in the network's history _ according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the ratings service of record since the 1950s Last year, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> signed up with <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> competitor <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a British company. Although AGB numbers are not bought by the other networks, nor are they used in the real business of television ratings _ negotiating advertising rates _ <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> uses <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> to back its contention that <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s new people-meter audience measurement system is inaccurate. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> estimates that the networks will lose a combined $ 50 million in advertising revenues because of the lower numbers produced by people meters. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> agree that <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s new system is not accurate enough, but they have n't been hurt as much as CBS. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has prospered. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> would n't say how much of the $ 50 million loss was CBS'. According to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, the network averages after 29 weeks of the 30-week season were: NBC 16.1, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.7 and CBS 13.5. The rating is a percentage of an estimated 88.6 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes equipped with television. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said AGB figures gave <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 16.2, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 13.9 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.2. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> conceded that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has little hope of getting advertisers and the other networks to switch to AGB in lieu of <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION>. Despite the ratings system squabble, a general erosion in network audiences is uncontested, <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> said, although the extent of it is unknown. According to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, the three-network average rating dropped 9 percent from 1986-87 to 1987-88. The previous year there was a 3 percent drop. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> estimates that roughly half of the percentage drop is real and half is a function of the people meter, a more complex measurement device that requires particiants to actively punch in and punch out when they watch television. The old system was a hands-off attachment on the set. Historically, networks have lost audiences to increasing cable availability, but this season the numbers show all cable channels combined gaining only 1.2 percent in the ratings. The biggest drop in network audiences was in the realm of theatrical movies, indicating increased use of cable or videocassettes. However, audiences are also rejecting new network programming. The highest-rated new show of the season was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' which, with an average rating of 25.1, is the only new show to qualify as a bona fide hit. But it has never been tested away from its timeslot that follows the No. 1-rated `` The Cosby Show,'' of which it is a spinoff. Otherwise, new shows performed miserably. Of the 47 this season, only eight exceeded the a 14.4 rating, the average for all network prime-time programming.

<TEXT>
 Stepping over splintered glass and twisted metal, <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> officials led foreign visitors through Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s former home Friday to mark the second anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. The tour began at 2 a.m., the time that F-111 fighter bombers attacked the Libyan capital and the coastal city of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> on April 15, 1986. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he ordered the raid in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in the bombing of a West German nightclub which left two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and a Turkish woman dead. Two bomb explosions in the last two days _ one near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, which killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> woman _ may have been linked to the anniversary. Libyan officials promised <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> would appear early Friday at the house, which was hit in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid. But after an hour, the visitors were escorted back from the fortified barracks compound on the outskirts of the city to their hotel downtown. No explanation was given for <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s absence. Most of the 40-odd visitors were delegates to a three-day conference on terrorism that ended Friday. The group included people from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Journalists also were invited on the tour. Some of the convention delegates signed a green guest book in the rubble-strewn entrance hall of the two-story tile-decorated structure. The Libyans have turned the ruins into a memorial. The walls of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s two master bedrooms are covered with chalk graffiti, which guides said were the work of students denouncing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers used in the raid took off from a British base. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, addressing the convention delegates on Wednesday night, spoke about the 1986 raid that Libyans said killed 37 people, including his adopted baby daughter. `` Even if they were able to kill me on that day _ the day of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-NATO </ORGANIZATION> barbarous aggression _ even if they were able to do that in the future, that does not mean that they have succeeded in accomplishing what they wanted,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a translation of his speech from Arabic by the official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am carrying the banner of peace in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and would like peace for my country as much as for the other countries of the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as telling the delegates. `` But at one time I thought of leaving this country to form an internationalist secret army to effectively terrorize the imperialists who savagely killed my children in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>.'' Friday, the Moslem holy day, found <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> quiet. Two soldiers with assault rifles guarded one of the entrances to <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s compound, where he lives and works In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a man claiming to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigades </ORGANIZATION> claimed that the bombing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club Thursday was in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The bombing in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> killed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicewoman and four Italian civilians. In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> cited an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source as saying a bombing at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radio relay station east of the capital Friday could be linked to the <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> anniversary. No injuries were reported.

<HEAD>Gore Increases Campaign Debt To $1.6 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has taken out $ 100,000 in new loans from banks in his home state, plunging his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination $ 1.6 million into debt. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was able to obtain the loans even though his prospects for winning his party's nomination appear to be dimming. Polls indicate that his support in next Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, and the contest a week later in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, is mired in the single digits. He has not won an event since finishing first in six of the 21 Super Tuesday contests on March 8. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has spent at least $ 700,000 on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television advertising. Of his two rivals, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has purchased $ 550,000 worth of ads and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reportedly will spend as much as $ 1.5 million. Campaign officials said the most recent loans, for $ 50,000 each, were from the <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on April 11 and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Putnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cookeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, the following day. Campaign manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the campaign has no plans to take out any more loans before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, but he would not rule out additional loans after that. The campaign had acknowledged a $ 50,000 loan from <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on April 5. One problem <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> might face in repaying the loans is that the federal matching funds he has been receiving may soon be dwindling. Federal assistance to campaigns is diminished if a candidate fails to receive 10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries _ which <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has already done _ and then fails to achieve 20 percent support thereafter.

Their letter, addressed to `` Dear Friend of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' accuses liberals of `` trying to put <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in jail for standing up for our freedom. That's why we need to show Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> that he has friends not only in the great Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, but all across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` I think <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be the best and strongest candidate with the right kind of charisma to beat someone like a <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, referring to former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.

 A dozen rockets went off Friday at a smoldering ammunition dump that exploded five days earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Five people were injured in the latest blasts. High temperatures rekindled fires at the devastated ammunition dump, detonating twelve rockets, the official <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying. Five people were injured in surrounding areas, the news agency said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s conservation chief said Friday that more volunteers are needed to help carry out a massive program aimed at protecting the nation's soil and water resources. Last year some 2,200 volunteers provided more than $ 1 million worth of assistance to agency field offices, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> Scaling, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. This `` Earth Team,'' he said, put in more than 132,000 hours in helping with tree planting, inventorying wetlands, conservation education, telephoning land owners to inform them of the Conservation Reserve Program and providing clerical and other office help. Many of the volunteers have expertise in geology, biology, botony, surveying, mapping, and soil and erodibility determinations, Scaling said. Under the 1985 farm law, farmers with highly erodible cropland must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989, and have it implemented by Dec. 31, 1994, or loss <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> benefits such as price support loans, payments and insurance. Scaling said the agency estimates that 800,000 conservation plans still need to be developed nationwide. Anyone interested in volunteering for the Earth Team, he said, can call 1-800-THE SOIL for the location of the local <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> office. Volunteers receive coverage for injury claims, are compensated for travel expenses, and have their contributions made part of a permanent work record, Scaling said.

<HEAD>Panel Updates Guidelines for Treatment of High Blood Pressure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal advisory panel issued updated guidelines on treating high blood pressure Friday, citing the potential value of new classes of drugs but emphasizing the need to prescribe the lowest effective dose of any medication. Intended primarily for physicians, the recommendations were described by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> panel as `` a sort of Bible or gospel of treatment.'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chobanian </PERSON>, incoming dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, added that the suggestions were based on an eight-month review of latest research to update the guidelines last issued four years ago. He noted that two new classes of drugs _ so-called calcium antagonists and enzyme inhibitors _ have been approved for treating high blood pressure since the last report. `` For many patients, they may cause fewer symptomatic and biochemical side effects than diuretics and beta blockers,'' he said, referring to the only high blood pressure drugs on the market in 1984. But <PERSON> Chobanian </PERSON> emphasized that the updated guidelines call for `` lower initial doses for most drugs than we did in 1984.'' `` The point here is that smaller doses mean fewer side effects,'' he said at a news conference. `` This a critical advantage because the side effects of traditional antihypertensive drugs have been a major stumbling block to keeping patients on their treatment.'' Among other things, the widely used diuretics can cause impotence and excessive loss of potassium in some patients. `` We recommend that some patients, especially those with mild hypertension, start with nondrug treatments,'' said <PERSON> Chobanian </PERSON>. `` By that I mean reducing weight, limiting sodium and alcohol, stopping smoking, exercising and perhaps using biofeedback and relaxation techniques.'' The report urges physicians to carefully monitor those patients who do need drug treatment with an eye to reducing the dosage or perhaps eliminating such medication. The updated guidelines also say people with high blood pressure should drink no more than the equivalent of two beers a day, down from three in the 1984 report, and emphasizes that lowering blood pressure alone is not a major reducer of heart attacks if the patient does not also control other risk factors _ especially smoking and high blood cholesterol levels.

<HEAD>Senate Bill Encourages Alternative Fuels Such as Coal, Gas, Grain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday passed legislation designed to foster use of alternative motor fuels in order to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependency on foreign petroleum and tap vast <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies of coal, natural gas and grain. The bill passed on a voice vote over warnings by Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that it could lead to increased emissions of the `` greenhouse'' gases that some scientists say are overheating the Earth's atmosphere. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action all but ensures that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will enact alternative fuels legislation in 1988. A similar proposal was passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The bills' differences will have to be resolved by negotiators from both chambers Both proposals are geared toward encouraging the automobile industry to mass-produce vehicles that can operate on fuels such as methanol, ethanol and compressed natural gas. Methanol, which powers <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500-type race cars at 200 miles an hour, can be manufactured from coal or natural gas. Ethanol is made from grains like corn. The legislation has broad support from coal and agricultural state lawmakers. The proposals would break an impasse that now prevents any widespread switchover from gasoline to alternative fuels, according to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., a principal sponsor along with Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` Automakers are unwilling to produce -LRB- alternative fuel -RRB- cars for which there is no current demand,'' `` Consumers are unwilling to purchase cars for which there is no readily available fuel supply, and service stations are unwilling to provide fuel for cars that are not on the road.'' <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said that besides lessening the growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> need for imported oil, a conversion of just 10 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vehicle fleet to coal-based methanol would mean jobs for 20,000 miners in the depressed coal industry. The sponsors said automakers would be encouraged to mass-produce vehicles using alternative fuels because the legislation would make it easier to meet the federal requirement that their fleets have an average fuel economy of at least 26 miles per gallon. Under the bill's formula, a 25 mpg vehicle that uses a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline would get a fuel economy rating of 165 mpg, according to <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>. A 25 mpg vehicle using a 50-50 blend would be rated at 40 mpg, he said. The higher credits for alternative fuels would begin with the vehicle 1993 model year. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>'s argument that methanol and ethanol would cause fewer environmental and health problems than gasoline was disputed by <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> said coal-derived methanol would double emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect, and bring a tenfold increase in tailpipe emissions of formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical He urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to proceed cautiously because many scientists warn that the production of greenhouse gases is overloading the atmosphere, trapping heat around the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and threatening major climate changes. `` Once we commit to a program like this, it will be too late,'' said <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully tried to add amendments to require alternative vehicles to meet the same emissions standards as gasoline vehicles. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> succeeded in adding language putting the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on record as saying that coal-based methanol would boost carbon dioxide levels, contribute to global overheating and should not be used until emissions controls are developed to control carbon dioxide.

 <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> airlines maintenance crews Friday began making temporary repairs to a crippled jetliner, replacing an engine that exploded in midair and patching holes that ripped through both sides of the cabin. The Fokker F-28 4000, a Dutch-made jet carrying 56 passengers and a crew of four, was forced to land at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> on Thursday after it lost cabin pressure and plunged partway toward the ground as passengers screamed and fainted. After the workers replace the engine and cover the holes, the plane is to be flown Saturday to a <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> maintenance facility at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, for further study and repair, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubar </PERSON>, manager of Yeager Airport. The engine mounted on the right side of the fuselage exploded Thursday morning as the plane was at 31,000 feet en route from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. It was a half-hour out of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, and about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, when the explosion occurred. A turbine blade and other engine parts cut through the plane's right rear bathroom and a flight attendant work area No one was hit by the debris, but two flight attendants suffered bumps and bruises as the plane plunged. The explosion was the first significant trouble reported with the engines of a Fokker F-28, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> statistics show. <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> manufactured the engine that exploded Thursday. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flies 25 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 4000s, which carry 72 people, and 20 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 1000s, which carry 62. They've used the <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> planes for about four years, but the model has been in use elsewhere for about 20 years. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said it was too early to tell whether safety checks will be required for the F-28s in <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>'s fleet. `` The damage that took place is very apparent,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who handled the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s initial investigation of the incident. `` What we have is engine failure ... and the side of the airplane was breached. `` There was only limited work we could to there -LRB- in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office. `` Our work does n't really begin until we can get the engine and the plane elsewhere.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that despite the relatively safe history of the <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> model, the investigation would be needed to check whether the problem could be found in other <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> planes. `` Right now, were going to look at that particular aircraft and that model of aircraft,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` During the course of the investigation, that will all be looked at, but we ca n't make that determination now. `` We want to look at the problem it poses for the future. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, in general, is set up to investigate accidents and prevent similar occurrences.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> has only two injury accidents involving <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28s in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> since the early 1980s, one when there was a minor collision on an airport taxiway and the other when a person fell off the boarding stairs when a guardrail gave way, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> contended that with such a record, grounding the airline's other Fokkers would not be necessary. `` We'll take a judicious approach to what the next step will be,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. The airline, based in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, owns 25 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 4000 planes and 20 of the F-28 1,000 series.

<HEAD>Smothers Brothers Producer Lauds Exemption; 3-D `Moonlighting'
Scrapped</HEAD>

 The producer of the `` New <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>'' said Friday that approval of an independent contract with striking scriptwriters came in the nick of time for the show and its stars. `` We made the point that it would be financially and, careerwise, disastrous for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'' if the show ended, producer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kragen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, whose members are concluding the fifth week of their strike against producers and studios, voted Thursday to reject independent contracts that would have allowed work to resume at selected companies, with two exceptions: the Smothers' show and <ORGANIZATION> Ivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, which has produced such movies as `` Ghostbusters'' and `` Animal House.'' Guild leaders had recommended against allowing the separate contracts because `` it could lead to divisiveness and destruction of morale among members,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She added, however, that the exceptions were granted because of unspecified legal considerations and because negotiations with the two producers `` were more advanced.'' While the contract agreement with the 9,000-member union forbids discussion of terms, <PERSON> Kragen </PERSON> said he believed the Smothers' support of the strike on their show, as well as their reputation among writers, won the day. `` There are a lot of writers who got their start in the business with the Smothers, and went on to win Emmys. And now some of them are on the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> board of directors,'' said <PERSON> Kragen </PERSON>. He also said the three union-written scripts for the show, which ran out with Wednesday night's 8 p.m. broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>, were kept untainted by non-union revisions. `` They laid out guidelines for us. We strained mightily, but we stayed within those guidelines, and I think that impressed them,'' <PERSON> Kragen </PERSON> said. Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> made official what `` Moonlighting'' producer <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> announced four weeks ago: The much-publicized 3-D version of the popular program for the May ratings sweeps period has been scrubbed. `` After exhausting all of our options, we have concluded that to go forward without an original script would not be in the best interests of ` Moonlighting,' our viewers or Coca-Cola,'' a promoter of the episode, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for prime-time entertainment, said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, federal mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> scheduled a meeting Monday morning between the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> and representatives from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. Writers on both coasts went on strike March 7. The walkout shortened the season for some prime-time TV shows and stalled the start of a few new series. There have been no formal negotiations since mediated talks broke off March 10. Producers spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said he had little hope for the Monday session, adding that alliance negotiators will attend because the law requires them to. He declined comment on the contract waiver deals. Disputed issues include how much writers are paid for foreign broadcasts of their material and for reruns on domestic television. How much creative input they have over their work is also an issue.

 The Soviet withdrawal agreement brought no accord to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Friday: President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> asked the guerrillas to join a coalition government and they demanded he be tried by a Moslem religious court. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply arms to the Moslem insurgents. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is confirming its policy of neoglobalism, a course of export of counter-revolution,'' it said. The guerrillas were not invited to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations and have said they will continue fighting. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name, also sent a message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> thanking him for his efforts leading to the agreement signed Thursday, under which the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will begin May 15 to withdraw the 115,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a statement broadcast by by <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> invited the guerrillas to accept his policy of national reconcilittion. `` We are prepared to cooperate with those who are still fighting this honorable policy,'' he said. `` We stress our willingness to meet the leaders of the opposition in order to reach a decision on peace, for the happiness of afflicted people ... for the future of the country's children. We are waiting for the -LRB- naming -RRB- of your candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' Elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> ended Thursday. The guerrillas, who have been fighting since a Communist coup in April 1978, were offered seats but dismissed the election as a farce. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said 1.5 million people voted, showing their `` confidence, needs and views.'' About 5 million Afghans _ one-third of the population _ have left the country since Soviet soldiers arrived in December 1979. `` Another step has been taken toward ending war and brother-killing ... deepening political dialogue, the expansion of democracy, the establishment of a coalition government with the participation of all forces which represent the Afghan society,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-party guerrilla alliance based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, a border city in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and all members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must be tried in absentia by religious courts. He said Soviet soldiers held by the guerrillas would be exchanged for Afghan army soldiers, and `` all those POWs will be kept until the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> regime is toppled and is replaced by an Islamic government so all those criminals who flee with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could be brought back ... for trial'' in exchange for the prisoners. `` In my view, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ... including <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> the puppet must be tried in absentia ... so that after the withdrawal of the Russian forces such criminals be dealt with in accordance with Islamic laws, and those who have been misled and played off against their nation by these criminals be pardoned,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said. The insurgents have said they will not share power with Communists in a future government, but had not called for trials. They have predicted that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> would follow the Soviet soldiers to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders have not said how many Soviet prisoners they have, but last month <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> party said an agreement had been reached to exchange a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldier for 25 guerrilla prisoners. The exchange has not occurred.

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> weekly newspaper editor who rose to be a presidential spokesman and Wall Street executive, often boasted that he never lied to the press during his years at the White House. But in his new book, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> admitted that he fabricated quotes and attributed them to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He resigned Friday as vice president for communications of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, saying it was `` the best course of action'' in the wake of that admission. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' successor, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, would say only, `` I'm sorry for him, personally.'' Earlier, he had called <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' practice an outrage, said it reflected on the integrity of the White House press office. He promised that he would never do anything similar. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, 48, became the chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, was wounded during an assassination attempt on the president on March 30, 1981. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has continued to hold the title of press secretary although he has been unable to return to his duties. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who served two years as a deputy to <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> and then became press secretary to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has been the chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman since <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> left the post 14 months ago. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Merigold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, which he describes in his book, `` Speaking Out,'' as `` <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the heartland, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The words are similar to those <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has often used in speaking of his own home town, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, Ill. In fact, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said that when he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of his decision to leave the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and accept the offer from <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, he told him, `` As a kid growing up in a town in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> of 700, I never expected to meet a president, much less work with one.'' He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` Well, what do you think of a kid growing up in a small town in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississipi </ORGANIZATION> for four years, but did not receive a degree because he had not completed his second year of French. While in summer school trying to complete the work, he accepted an offer to be editor of the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, Eagle, a weekly with a circulation of about 4,000. For a young married man whose wife was expecting their first child, the salary of $ 85 a week was too good in 1961 to turn down. Later he held editorial posts at other <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> weeklies and became co-owner of four such newspapers. In 1968, he came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as press secretary to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s Democratic Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>. He was an honorary pallbearer at <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION>'s funeral in 1986 and said in his book, `` Not a day goes by even now that I do n't remember him and tell another <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION> story.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> first entered the White House in 1974 as an assistant to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned a few months later and <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> stayed on to serve as an assistant in President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s press office. In the 1976 election, he was press secretary to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. After <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> lost to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> went to work for the public relations firm of <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knowlton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Saying that he found the public relations business `` neither as interesting nor as much fun as I had expected it to be,'' he went to work for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign in 1980 and then returned to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a deputy press secretary. After he took over the chief spokesman's job, his relations with the White House press corps were often contentious, with <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> accusing reporters of being out to get the president, and the reporters accusing <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> of not being candid. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> often said his credibility was his most precious possession and he would not risk losing it by lying to the press. In his book, however, he says that at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1985 summit meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> he had an aide `` draft some quotes for the president,'' polished them and then told reporters that they were what the president said to the Soviet leader. `` In restrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,'' he said in his book. But, he added, `` I had been able to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with my P.R. man's license.

<DATELINE>SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> suburb is 2-for-2 when it comes to electing mayors. The first elected mayor was indicted four times before he was convicted of fraud and extortion conspiracy. The second and current elected mayor, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, turned himself in Friday, the day after he was indicted on theft charges by a <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury. He was booked at the county jail and released on a $ 2,000 bond, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state attorney's office. An arraignment date was not set. The grand theft count, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine, charges that <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> last year illegally obtained a city-owned chain saw worth at least $ 300, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. The petty theft charge accuses <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> of ordering workers at the city garage to repair a riding lawn mower owned by his daughter, said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. The petty theft charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. The alleged incident took place between August 1986 and February 1987. Asked on his way into the jail if was confident he'd be vindicated, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s only reply was, `` Very.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 62, a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer and self-emloyed insurnce appraiser, was elected to the non-partisan post in this town of 40,000 in September 1985. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing since the allegations became public early this year. He voluntarily testified before the grand jury for nearly three hours Wednesday. Former city garage employee <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who maintains he resigned from his job because he was harassed for tattling on the mayor, said after the indictment was issued that `` justice has been done. We've been telling the truth from the beginning.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, the second elected mayor in Sunrise's 21-year history, also is the second elected mayor to be indicted while in office. Former Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomelo </PERSON> was indicted four times during his 18-year term. In the first three cases, he was acquitted or cleared by a judge. But in 1985, he was convicted by a federal jury of extortion conspiracy for forcing a developer to pay a friend $ 30,000 in exchange for his support on a nursing home project. He was also convicted in a $ 52,000 mail fraud scheme. <PERSON> Lomelo </PERSON> was released from prison last year. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the governor had not received official word of the indictment and had not acted to suspend <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> from office. Such suspensions are required when a mayor is indicted on a felony count. `` The governor ca n't suspend unless and until we have paperwork,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. `` Clearly, if there is an indictment and he is suspended, the governor will move quickly to fill the vacancy.''

 Federal investigators said Friday they have broken up a Chinese heroin-trafficking ring, arresting 11 people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and nine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while seizing 137 pounds of heroin worth over $ 100 million. Five of those arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were charged with conspiring to supply 1,000 M-16 military rifles to undercover federal agents and to provide false documents so the rifles could be shipped to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The breakup of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> ring was the culmination of a two-year investigation called <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> that was launched when federal agents learned that a restaurant owner in the <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was buying stolen firearms and distributing cocaine. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> conducted the investigation and law enforcement officials announced the arrests at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Drug-importing Asian criminal gangs `` are moving in to fill the void'' left by the successful prosecution of Sicilian Mafia members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into the hands of terrorists and drug smugglers,'' Customs commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said in a statement. Federal officials said the ring had supplied 600 handguns, mostly to Chinese gangs. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> inserted undercover operatives into the ring, including a Chinese-speaking agent who portrayed himself as a drug dealer. The Cantonese-speaking federal agent, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Yau </PERSON>, met with gang members in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to negotiate the purchase of heroin from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The heroin came from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and was transported to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>. It also was distributed to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen or illegally obtained hand - and machine guns and rifles on the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, usually to Chinese gangs Many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulent identification documents from gun shops in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the officials said. The Chinese gangs were buying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles _ the civilian version of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s M-16 rifle _ and converting them into fully automatic M-16s. Customs and <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> undercover agents bought 10 weapons from the five people charged in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and ordered 1,000 more M-16s that were to be delivered to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Such shipments would have violated the Arms Export Control Act, which sets up federal licensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries.

 The town of <LOCATION> Ogunquit </LOCATION> will appeal a $ 300,000 jury award to a Canadian woman who sued for injuries suffered when she was knocked down by a teen-ager trying to catch a Frisbee on a beach, an attorney said. <PERSON> Josee </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, was struck from behind by the teen-ager as she walked along the beach while on vacation in July 1982.

<HEAD>Pro-Stalin Letter A Mistake, Soviet Paper Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Soviet newspaper said Friday that it made a mistake by printing a letter that criticized <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and defended <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> The letter from a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher, published March 13, said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s accomplishments were being ignored and his crimes overemphasized. It criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' program of restructuring Soviet society. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, the organ of the Russian republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government, said in an editor's note Friday that it used poor judgement in printing the letter The editors said they had `` not demonstrated enough responsiblity, a sufficiently balanced approach and the understanding that -LRB- the letter -RRB- leads one away from the revolutionary renewal of society through democracy and glasnost.'' Glasnost is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness in selected topics. The editor's note was accompanied by 10 readers' letters condemning the teacher's comments. Some observers believe the offending letter indicated the newspaper fell under the influence of conservatives led by <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, considered the second most powerful official in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, has suggested that glasnost has gone too far in uncovering past Soviet mistakes. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said in an editorial April 5 that <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>'s editors had been irresponsible in publishing the teacher's letter and warned that the Soviet press is `` not a private shop'' where opponents of party decisions can voice their opinions. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON> reprinted the Pravda article without comment on April 6. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised Pravda for setting the record straight. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON> discussed the letter again in Friday's editions, on a page bearing the headline `` The Party is Going to the Lead of Perestroika. It said it had been swamped with letters about the dispute and claimed all supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program. However, the editors said they would not shy away from controversial articles. `` Direct, frank talking to readers has been, is and will remain the main genre of our party newspaper,'' they wrote. In an accompanying article, historian <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryansky </PERSON> defended the media's uncovering of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes and rehabilitation of his victims. He said the writing proved that `` the truth, no matter how concealed, sooner or later will triumph.''

<HEAD>Judge Warns Against Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra trial warned Friday against the unauthorized disclosure of some 300,000 classified documents expected to be turned over to the defense by prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. In an order detailing procedures for handling the documents by the defense, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> warned that `` unauthorized disclosure of classified information may constitute violations of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> criminal laws.'' `` Persons subject to this order are advised that direct or indirect unauthorized disclosure, retention or negligent handling of classified documents or information could cause serious damage, and in some cases exceptionally grave damage, to the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or may be used to the advantage of a foreign nation against the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the judge said. The nine-page order requires that the defendants, their lawyers and any witnesses must obtain approval of the court-designated security officer before gaining access to classified documents. Access will be granted on a `` need-to-know'' basis and the defendants, their lawyers and witnesses must sign an agreement not to make unauthorized disclosures of the information contained in the documents, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` Any violation of the terms of this order shall be immediately brought to the attention of the court and may result in a charge of contempt of court and possible reference for criminal prosecution,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> are accused of conspiring with arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to divert profits illegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. At a hearing Tuesday, independent counsel <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that as many as 300,000 classified documents are being reviewed by an interagency government task force. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he expected that 50,000 documents relevant to the case will be ready for defense review by month's end. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered that the defense is entitled to review the rest of the material to determine if it is relevant to their case when the matter goes to trial. The order requires that lawyers can only work with the documents or discuss them with each other or witnesses in the special security facility that is being constructed by the court security officer. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> prescribed a type of word processing equipment, which is apparently resistant to electronic eavesdropping, to be used by the defense for preparing court pleadings based on the materials. All pleadings dealing with classified information must be prepared in the facility and filed under seal with the court security officer, who will delete classified references before the briefs are placed in the public file, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered. Before any classified document is introduced into evidence at the trial, it must be declassified by the government agencies that produced it. If the government refuses to declassify a document, the Classified Information Procedures Act empowers the court to substitute a statement of facts that the material would prove. The court could also agreed to delete certain classified markings that reveal intelligence methods but were not pertinent to the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> gave the defense until April 29 to file a challenge to the application fo the classified information statute to the case. The defense complained that the law requires procedures that inhibit their ability to prepare their case.

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won praise but no endorsement Friday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who said all the contenders were `` singularly important'' Democrats. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said at a state Capitol news conference that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner in polls preceding Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, was `` a singularly important Democratic leader.'' Two days earlier, the governor had told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> he was `` singularly important Democrat.'' Questioned by reporters, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said all the Democratic candidates, including <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were `` singularly important'' no matter where they finish. Recent polls show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> far behind in the battle for the 255 delegates at stake in the primary, the biggest delegate prize of the campaign season so far. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has n't met with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> since March 21 and is not scheduled to. On Friday, the governor scrapped plans to make campaign stops with all three candidates in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area over the next few days. His aides cited the press of state business. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke with students at a junior high school in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, warning against using illegal drugs and engaging in an exchange with students on how widespread the problem is. He met privately with some students and said they told him 25 percent to 50 percent of school-age kids were using drugs. Then, he walked around the crowded school auditorium, asking students how many of their peers used drugs regularly. `` Crack can kill you, right? Who was killed by crack _ <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON>, right? ... In about four minutes, that young man's life was snuffed out,'' he said, referring to the former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> basketball star. At one point, he asked students what should be done to students who use drugs. `` Should we suspend them?'' he asked, eliciting a chorus of `` no'' from the students. `` Why not _ they're breaking the law, are n't they?'' he said. Later, at a rally in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> after his appearance with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not doing more in the fight against illegal drugs. `` Why do we have money for Star Wars and not money for a war against drugs?'' he asked. `` The greatest threat in this hemisphere is not the Sandinistas, it's the avalanche of drugs.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, during his news conference with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said all three candidates had grown during the campaign, but he declared `` that is particularly true of Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' `` If Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> becomes the candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he will be a superb representative of the Democrats,'' he said. `` I believe he will be a winner in November and I believe he would go on to be a great president.'' During their news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he had `` any fear that when you get to the convention, you may be facing him -LRB- <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> -RRB- as a competitor?'' `` Should I have?'' joked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor said, `` No.'' While <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declared more than a year ago that he would n't seek the Democratic presidential nomination, it was only in the past few days that he has indicated he would n't accept a draft at a deadlocked convention. When the questioning turned to whether the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would want <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to serve in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said it was `` not the time to be thinking about who should be in your administration.'' `` Can we fix a time?'' asked <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` But his mother always wanted him to serve on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 A bomb exploded in front of a crowded movie theater in downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> on Friday night, killing a man and injuring a woman, police said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> said the blast occurred about 7:30 p.m. -LRB- 1:30 p.m. EDT -RRB- on the street in front of the Sterland Cinema complex. A second explosion happened about 15 minutes later at a shop several blocks away. <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> said a man was killed in the theater blast, and police are investigating whether he may have been the person who planted the bomb. He said a woman was slightly wounded. He had said earlier that there were `` numerous'' injuries, but amended his report. The spokesman said the dead man's body was `` very badly mutilated,'' and a car in the street was destroyed. But he said there was no damage to the eight-cinema complex, which attracts hundreds of people on Friday nights. `` The possibility that the man killed was the person who placed the bomb is being investigated,'' <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> said. `` At this stage this has not been determined whether this is the case or not.'' Police immediately evacuated the movie theaters and cordoned off surrounding streets. The second blast occurred on a street where all the shops were closed for the evening. Some windows were broken but there were no injuries, <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> said. No one claimed responsibility for the explosions. On Thursday night, a bomb damaged the facade of the City Hall building in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, but caused no injuries. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. However, police have blamed virtually all bombings in recent years on the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the white-led government. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> rarely confirms or denies involvement in bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. There have been more than 60 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the government declared a state of emergency in June 1986. Three blacks, including a policemen, were killing March 17 in a car bombing in <LOCATION> Krugersdorp </LOCATION>, about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Child care is `` a new urgency for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s working parents'' and increasingly an issue that employers must face, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Friday Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said the issue was `` a national concern.'' `` Let's start with a key fact: over half of the country's women with pre-school or school-age children work,'' she said at a news conference, noting that each group of children from infants to latch-key children required a different programmatic response. The department's 12-member Task Force on Child Care, composed of senior <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, has reviewed proposed legislation, major articles, surveys and studies on the issue to determine the severity of the problem. The panel's report found the child care issue to be `` a matter of new urgency for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s working parents, one that by simple arithmetic is of considerable magnitude.'' The task force said that there was `` widespread -LRB- public -RRB- concern that a crisis exists ... in the ability of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s parents'' to find child care, but the panel stopped short of describing the problem as a crisis. `` We do n't see it as a national ... crisis but we see it as a terrific national concern,'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The report, entitled `` Child Care: A Workforce Issue,'' said the federal government is already addressing the child care issue with more than $ 6.9 billion spent on <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> and other child care programs. It said state and local governments have shown commitment to funding for child care, training providers, referral systems and defining standards for providers. But although many employers have realized the economic benefits of responding to employee child care needs, others have yet to grasp the impact of inadequate child care on worker performance and absenteeism, the report said. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would conduct a comprehensive review of all departmental laws and regulations to evaluate their impact on work and family; recognize employers and unions who develop new approaches to child care and publish and promote examples; provide technical assistance and information to labor and management, and increase the availability of child care options in the <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the Job Training Partnership Act. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said department's day care center would be expanded as an employer model, as would the availability of assistance to department employees.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Friday vetoed a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution that urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop deporting Palestinians from the occupied territories, saying the measure lacked balance. Arab diplomats denounced the action and said it hurt the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative to promote <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. Fourteen of the council's 15 members voted for the resolution and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> made an unusually harsh speech against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of deporting Palestinians allegedly linked to disturbances in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. British Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> called the deportations `` brutal and often indiscriminate actions'' and said they are `` immoral, illegal and politically self-defeating.'' `` World opinion has been shocked and disgusted _ rightly so _ by the widespread suffering of the civilian population of all ages and both sexes'' in the territories, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the veto `` mortally wounded'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative and would encourage <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to mistreat the 1.5 million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. `` The veto today ratifies that level of permissiveness that has emboldened <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to defy the international community,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> told a news conference after the council meeting. <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, envoy of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that has observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, told the council the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had isolated itself by killing the resolution. `` There's always a rotten apple in the box,'' he said. In casting the veto, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the resolution's `` broad and sweeping condemnation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contains not a scintilla of balance. It contains no appeal or request for calm.'' The measure urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to halt deportations, condemned human rights violations in the occupied territories and called for a U.N.-sponsored settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported eight <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians earlier this week and issued deportation orders for 12 others as part of its effort to quell four months of violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> that has claimed more than 140 Arab lives. Two Israelis have died. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> told the council the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is engaged in a major diplomatic effort to bring about direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and most Arab nations want a peace conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices that would include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Permanent members have veto power. Other members of the council are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist organization, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has opposed an international peace conference, saying it might try to force concessions that would jeopardize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. Despite its veto, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been critical of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of violence in the occupied territories. On Jan. 5, it cast a rare vote against Israeli, joining the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in approving a resolution urging the Jewish state to refrain from an earlier round of deportations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defied the resolution and deported four Palestinian activists to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Jan. 14 declined to use its veto to protect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and abstained as the council passed a resolution urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to let the deportees return. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said Friday the latest resolution was redundant.

 The former police chief of <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> was charged Friday with second-degree murder, a month after authorities dug up the remains of his wife's first husband in his yard after his father made a deathbed confession. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 36, appeared relaxed but said nothing as he surrendered at the state police station in <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> and sat through two court appearances in the 1978 killing of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, a close friend. Unable to post the $ 200,000 bail, he was taken to the <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. Chambers was not handcuffed during his arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> Keene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and bail hearing in superior court. He entered no plea, but his attorney, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisti </PERSON>, said his client will plead innocent to the charge, which he called a mistake. Bean was 25 when was last seen in 1978. His wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, moved in with <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and married him soon after her husband disappeared. After Bean's remains were found last month, she and Chambers separated. Chambers' sister, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, came forward March 10, the day after her father died. She said in affidavits that <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 61, told her that his son came to him 10 years ago and said he accidentally killed Bean in a fight, and that the father helped his son bury the body with a backhoe. Authorities dug for three days in a spot that once was a pig pen before finding Bean's remains 25 feet down. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> resigned as the town's part-time chief. He also took a leave of absence from his job as part-time chief of nearby <LOCATION> Gilsum </LOCATION> and was suspended without pay as a trainee with the <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION> police department. Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> announced the arrest at a news conference in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was not charged with first-degree murder because there was no evidence of premeditation. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said further charges related to concealment of a corpse may be filed, but that he anticipates no other arrests. If convicted, Chambers could be sentenced to 30 years in prison without parole, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said. While Chambers is held at the county jail he would be separated from other inmates to protect him from prisoners he might have arrested as a police officer, said the attorney general. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said he expects the defense to challenge the elder Chambers' `` dying declaration'' as inadmissible hearsay and anticipates having the issue settled by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> law allows so-called dying declarations to be admitted as evidence in certain cases. Although acknowledging that without the dying declaration Bean's body may never have been found, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said investigators have enough evidence after interviewing 15 to 20 people to convict Chambers even if his father's declaration is not allowed in court An autopsy showed Bean had been beaten with a blunt instrument. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> declined to say whether a weapon had been recovered, what physical evidence there was or whether there had been witnesses. Maj. <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who headed the investigation, said Bean's disappearance had not been treated as a crime in 1978 He said his investigation showed that Bean and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> `` had an altercation, which indicates there was bad blood.''

<TEXT>
 An explosive device blew up early Friday at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radio-relay station causing slight damage and no injuries, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> reported. He said the bomb had been placed near an air conditioning unit at the <LOCATION> Humosa </LOCATION> relay station six miles east of the U.S.-Spanish air base at <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION>. The air base is 12 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The Spanish news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source as saying the bombing could be related to the second anniversary of the April 15, 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The explosion occurred a day after a car bomb blew up in front of a USO club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, killing five people, including a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> servicewoman. Italian police said they believed a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was responsible. A group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigades </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was in revenge for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said no group or individual asserted responsibility for the attack near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. He said the blast damaged a maintenance building but did not interrupt <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> communications at <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION>. There have been many demonstrations in recent years at <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s membership in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In January, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw within three years a tactical wing of 72 F-16 fighter bombers from <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION>. That was part of a new eight-year pact on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military units in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that will replace a five-year accord which expires May 14. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed services maintain three air bases and a naval station in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that involve some 10,000 military personnel.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> business student whose dismissal and subsequent reinstatement in a women's studies class has sparked a controversy says he was intimidated by what he called `` male-bashing'' in the course `` I felt about as welcome in the class as a black at a Klan meeting,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> told a meeting of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> became the focus of a controversy after a dean, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>, banned him from an introductory women studies course during the winter quarter for alleged disruptive and threatening behavior. The dean later reinstated him, and <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> was given credit for the course although he had missed nearly half of the classes. The class is ungraded; one either passes or fails. The controversy has sparked several emotional campus demonstrations, and <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> has even been approached by television producers seeking rights to his story. Class instructors and some students had charged that <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>'s reinstatement was an attack on feminism and as violation of their academic freedom `` I believe it was a violation of the rights of women in the classroom, not to know why he was reinstated,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, who was a fellow student. She also claimed that she was verbally attacked by the 6-foot-2 inch, 220-pound <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and his supporters believe the instructors and their assistants were hostile and vehemently anti-male. `` There was male bashing during which all white males were described as child rapists and women abusers,'' said <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>. `` I had the feeling that if I were black or homosexual I would n't have been discriminated against.'' <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, an amateur bodybuilder who likes to refer to himself as <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> after the bodybuilder turned actor, denied charges he is anti-feminist, anti-homosexual or racist. `` I just think that this particular class hurts everyone. They say that everything is racist and sexist,'' he said. `` They twist it so far out of proportion that someone will not even listen to them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullen </PERSON> said the meeting was a fact-finding hearing and that he did n't believe it was the committee's job to delve into course content. `` I am confident the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> administration </ORGANIZATION> can resolve this issue, but I have a personal interest in freedom of speech, the state's Equal Rights Amendment and the use of public funds for political purposes,'' said <PERSON> Pullen </PERSON>. Asked why <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> had been given credit for the course even though he did n't complete it, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said it was an unsual situation and a review of <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>'s work indicated he would pass the course if he completed it. As for charges that individual rights had been violated, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said, `` our conclusion after exhaustive review is that the record for winter quarter 1988 contains too much conflicting information to warrant student disciplinary action.'' Testimony before the committee also was conflicting. `` I found Women's Studies 200 a stimulating, exciting course and it did not engage in male-bashing or racism,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, another of <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>'s fellow students, said: `` When I asked a question about where a guest lecturer got her information on Indians in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, I was told that I was a racist. I was told that all white people are racists and those who say they are n't are practicing denial.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zehnder </PERSON>, another fellow student, said he did not find <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> either disruptive or disrespectful in class. `` The problem arose because he was perceived as a threat to unusual teaching techniques. `` The instructors presented erroneous or misleading statistics and personal opinions as fact,'' <PERSON> Zehnder </PERSON> asserted. He also said he was told by an instructor that he would be flunked if he ever used the words lady or girl in written work.

<TEXT>
 Four Navajo men were arrested Friday in the Dec. 4 slayings of two Navajo tribal police officers believed beaten and shot while trying to break up a desert drinking party. The arrests capped an investigation in which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> authorities questioned more than 100 tribal members about the discovery of the bodies in a burned-out police van at a remote desert site near <LOCATION> Monument </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on Dec. 5. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the four suspects were residents of <LOCATION> Monument </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a reservation town near the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border where they were arrested. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>, both 22; <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedoni </PERSON>, 31; and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24, a cousin of <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>, awaited arraignment on federal charges of first-degree murder on an Indian reservation and aiding and abetting. Four to 10 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had been in Monument Valley since the day after the slayings, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. `` When you have two fellow police officers brutally shot down, it is a priority with our agency, and certainly with the others involved. These arrests today will bring these individuals before the bar of justice,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. Navajo police said tribal officers <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Begay </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Halchita </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Oljeto </LOCATION>, appeared to have been beaten and shot in the head after responding to a disturbance near Gouldings shortly before midnight Dec. 4. An argument may have developed when the officers tried to break up a drinking party at the site, where a bonfire had been built, police said. Teeth matching one of the officers and pools of blood were found there. The officers' vehicles were taken into Copper Canyon and set afire, the bodies placed in the prisoner compartment of one of them, Navajo police said. A $ 10,000 reward had been posted in the case. In February the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said that suspects in the slayings had been identified but that investigators could not persuade witnesses to testify because they apparently feared retribution.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slammed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Friday for putting `` drug-peddling'' Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payroll, but Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted that it is <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that has been propping up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with millions of dollars. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made fun of efforts by fellow Democrats <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to claim leadership in the fight against drugs, saying they are captains and lieutenants while `` I'm the general in this war.'' As the presidential campaign moved into the final weekend before the pivotal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday, the rhetoric was tamed. For Republicans, it was a day for unity. Democrats aimed their fire mostly at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, drug pushers and the owners of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ not at each other. Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> junior high school students about drug abuse, using wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s 26-year dependence on diet pills as an example. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor used the low-key approach of a talk-show host in discussing drug abuse, such as crack, the potent cocaine derivative. `` Crack can kill you, right? Who was killed by crack _ <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON>, right?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> basketball star. `` In about four minutes, that young man's life was snuffed out.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tossed aside a prepared speech on drugs, in which he criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for paying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> money through the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> before he was indicted for drug-running. `` Why do we have the money for Star Wars but not for the war against drugs? And why did you pay $ 200,000 a year to a dope-peddling, gun-running Panamanian dictator?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to meet with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who fell back on an old phrase to describe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` singularly important Democratic leader.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who is not endorsing anyone before Tuesday, had used almost the same words to describe <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> after a meeting Wednesday. For his part, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued his attack on drugs at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> housing project in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, where he compared drug dealers to members of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON>, who harassed and killed blacks while wearing white hoods. `` Ropes, sheets and hoods represent death,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a cheering crowd. `` We never lost as many lives to Southern rope'' as to drugs. `` The dope pusher does not wear sheets and hoods, the dope pusher is the hood who lives in the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, said Democratic charges that the administration had propped up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are `` demagogic statements.'' `` It is this administration that has brought <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> to justice, or at least taken the first step,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will go.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has resisted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic pressure because of outside help. `` Several reliable sources indicate that he is receiving millions of dollars in support from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He did not elaborate on his sources. Otherwise, the Republican nominee-to-be talked of pulling the party together for the fall general election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch with vanquished rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in his Capitol office, standing together for the cameras as <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> proclaimed, `` We're ready to go to work for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remaining rival for the nomination _ former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> _ admitted the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race is over and said he would campaign for the nominee. `` It is obvious from the delegate count ... that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be the nominee of the Republican party absent any unexpected eventuality,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. But he vowed to continue his minimalist campaign, saying he hoped to `` energize the people who support me'' to play a role in the GOP convention in August. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned a private meeting with former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, running a dismal third in the polls, temporarily dropped his constant attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and took on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Early Friday, he spoke to about two dozen members of employee unions at the airlines, currently embroiled in a bitter labor dispute and under close government scrutiny. The `` mismanagement of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> stands as a symbol of the kind of approach <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> encourage with their policies of hands-off, ` Let'em have whatever kind of labor relations they want,' promote greed as the principal guiding value for corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> tracking poll released Friday evening had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 44 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 37 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 10 percent. The poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday among 268 likely Democratic voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with a margin of error of 7 percentage points. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 49 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 34 percentand <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 8 percent. That poll consisted of the Wednesday interviews, of 176 likely Democratic voters, and had a margin of error of 9 percentage points. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, dismissed the poll results, saying, `` The polls have consistently been wrong,'' and said the undecided vote was beginning to go decidedly in his favor. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign is now $ 1.6 million in debt after $ 100,000 in new loans to finance <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ads. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, clearly tired of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s criticism in recent days, did not resist a swipe at the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator. `` I've got a competitor who is desperate to get in this race,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a widening leader in the fight for national convention delegates, according to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has 842.15 votes to 730.1 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 416.55, while uncommitted delegates have 617.75 delegate voters.

<HEAD>Death Penalth Recommended For Farmer In Mass Slaying</HEAD>

 A jury recommended Friday that a southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> dairy farmer be put to death for killing his wife and two nephews, including a teen-ager whom he had originally blamed for the killings. The jury which convicted <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> of Elkland of three counts of first-degree murder had the alternative of recommending life in prison. If a judge accepts the jury's recommendation, <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> would become the 57th person on death row at the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>, where there has not been an execution since 1965. The <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury Thursday found Schnick guilty in the deaths of his wife, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, and two nephews, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, 2. On Friday, they recommended the death penalty on all three counts. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> also is accused but was not tried in the deaths of his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>; <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON>; and the Buckners' two other sons, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON>, 6. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> were brother and sister. All the victims died in an early morning shooting spree Sept. 25 at the Buckner and Schnick families' dairy farms in nearby <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION>. The Schnicks' two young children were not injured. Schnick originally blamed the slayings on his nephew <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, and claimed he killed the boy in self-defense. The allegation shocked members of the community who knew the teen-ager, who was described as quiet and hard-working. Within days, however, <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> himself was charged in connection with the seven deaths. Police said he confessed during questioning, but he claimed during the trial that the confession was not freely given. <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> said the crimes were aggravated by the fact that <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> may have killed his wife in order to collect life insurance. The number of victims, and the youth of many of them, also prompted <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> to seek the death penalty. `` It's difficult to imagine anything more defenseless and more helpless in this world than a 2-year-old asleep in his bed,'' <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> said in his closing arguments. `` Anyone who would kill an infant in those circumstances deserves the most severe punishment possible under the law.'' <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s attorney pleaded for her client's life, on behalf, she said, of his two surviving children. `` No one is minimizing the terribleness or the horror of what has occurred ...,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` Healing comes with time and love and compassion. It's not going to come with vengence.'' Ms. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s friends and family members to attest that he had been a helpful neighbor and caring father. She said their testimony proved that `` there is the possibility of redemption.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, chief of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, testified that after evaluating <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> and interviewing many of his friends, he concluded that <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> strove all his life to please others and was frustrated by his inability to satisfy those closest to him when he lost control Sept. 25. `` The acting out that he did ... is very unlikely ever to be repeated,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. The defense contended during the trial that <PERSON> Schick </PERSON>'s confession was gained under pressure, and that he had been under the influence of medication on the day of the shootings. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s long-time physician, Dr. <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, said he examined Schnick Oct. 2, three days before his confession, and prescribed a painkiller. `` It dulls the awareness,'' Presley said. `` It tends tp make a patient sleepy and impair his intellectual function.'' But county coroner Dr. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Blinn </ORGANIZATION>, called as a rebuttal witness, said he prescribed the same painkiller often during his 41 years as a general practitioner, and rarely noted that his patients reacted with drowsiness.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says U.S. Trade Bill Will be Vetoed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto the omnibus trade bill before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders insist on plant closure safeguards, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Friday. He said the dispute could delay and possibly jeopardize congressional approval of the historic U.S.-Canada Fee Trade Agreement. `` The labor unions got their way,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Vancouver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a luncheon speech prior to a weekend meeting with the trade ministers of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. He credited <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the `` almost unprecedented'' deletion of dozens of protectionist portions of the trade bill, to the point where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might be able to sign it. But he said the Democratic leadership informed the administration on Thursday that they would not discard a section requiring owners to give substantive notice before any plant closures. `` That legislation is objected to vigorously by the American business community and the administration,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Therefore, the trade bill is going to be vetoed. We believe we can sustain the veto, which means we're back to ground zero after two or three years' work on a trade bill. `` That could have implications for the Free Trade Agreement.'' He said at the very least, the trade bill battle will delay consideration of the trade accord for about 30 days, and `` bruised feelings'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could erode support for it. The trade deal was negotiated with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Conservative government last year and is set to go in effect in January if ratified by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. It would eliminate all tariffs in the world's biggest trading partnership over a 10-year period and loosen non-tariff and investment barriers. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he remains confident the trade pact will be passed this year, but said the vote could come after Labor Day instead of prior to the summer recess as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hoped. He said it is possible that congressional leaders will amend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade bill before a final vote next Thursday or Friday, or revise it quickly after a presidential veto. `` I certainly would n't reach the conclusion the Free Trade Agreement is in mortal danger,'' he told a news conference. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> faces re-election in the next year and had hoped to have the trade agreement approved in time for a possible early election this fall. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> joined newly appointed Canadian Trade Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON>, Japanese Trade Minister <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> and Trade Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerq </PERSON> of the 12-nation European Community for a weekend retreat on isolated Quadra Island near <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. The regularly scheduled meeting was expected to focus on progress in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of talks to revamp the 95-country General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. For the first time, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is discussing world trading rules for services such as insurance and computer software. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also seeks more protection for patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as structural reform to improve the monitoring of trade practices. He said he also looked for progress with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over higher quotas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and citrus products. Otherwise, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will press its complaints before <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>.

 A 15-year-old suspected crack user accused of torching a home that his gang used as a hangout may have been seeking revenge against a resident who had complained to police, a detective said Friday. The resident's 12-year-old son was killed and six others injured in the fire early Thursday. <PERSON> Antione </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> was accused of using a blowtorch to set fire to a couch and a blanket in the house. He was arrested and charged as an adult with murder, arson and assault Thursday. Queens Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrelli </PERSON> said the 15-year-old and as many as nine other youths had taken over a man's first-floor apartment in the building about six weeks ago for `` fun and games'' and to package crack. Another resident, <PERSON> Eyvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 31, called police Wednesday night to complain that two gang members were throwing rocks at her second-floor windows. They were gone by the time a patrol car came by, police said. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> returned at 5:45 a.m. and started the fire, police said. `` It would appear the way they were comfortable in this residence was going to come to an end and they would probably have to leave,'' <PERSON> Borrelli </PERSON> said in speculating that revenge was the motive. The detective said the man in the first-floor apartment moved to another part of the house because `` he was intimidated and fearful.'' The house is just a few blocks from where a rookie police officer was shot to death at point-blank range in February while guarding the home of a man who had complained of drug dealing in the neighborhood. The Tactical Narcotics Team has made 560 arrests, 467 of them for narcotics, since designating the neighborhood a target area March 4. In addition to the death of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, three family members and three firefighters were injured, said. Investigators are looking for the other youths ranging in age from 15 to 20, <PERSON> Borrelli </PERSON> said.

 Former White House spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> quit as chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, days after he created an uproar by admitting he twice concocted quotes for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said in a statement that his resignation was `` the best course of action for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and for me personally. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> is a great firm and the industry leader, and I've enjoyed being part of it.'' The announcement reflected intense pressure on <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> to resign as head of communications at the Wall Street investment giant because of his disclosures in a book about his tenure as White House spokesman. He said in the book that he had attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> comments the president never made. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said in a statement: `` We accept <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' resignation with regret <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> has made a signficant contribution to our firm during his time here, and we wish him well in every regard.'' However, a source familiar with <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' decision, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said senior <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> management wanted him to quit because the phony-quote disclosures raised serious questions about his credibility and by extension the credibility of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> declined to elaborate on <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' resignation. `` I think the statement speaks for itself. I'm not going to veer from the statement,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> was not in the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices and his whereabouts were unclear. Sources at the firm said <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> asked for a meeting earlier this week with <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer, to discuss the controversy. They said the credibility issue was raised by <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>. `` We took the attitude that he, being the communicator, knew very well what this torrent of publicity was doing to him as our chief spokesman and the image of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> as its chief spokesman,'' one source said. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> with much fanfare 14 months ago. Sources inside the firm said he earned between $ 200,000 and $ 250,000 a year, about triple his $ 77,400 salary at the White House. He oversaw a staff of about 70 people with responsibility over <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s press relations, corporate advertising and in-house communications. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a weekend at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, declined to answer reporters' questions about <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, saying only `` no comment'' just before he stepped into his helicopter. The resignation was announced after <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> scrapped plans to attend a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> dinner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week as guest of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier he canceled an appearance at <ORGANIZATION> Denison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Granville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, because of what school officials called the controversy over his new book, titled `` Speaking Out.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> admitted in the book that on two occasions he attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quotes that the president never said. Earlier this week <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> claimed he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the quotes later, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied that. In his book, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says he quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying after the downing of a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet in 1983 by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that the incident posed a problem not between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but a `` Soviet versus the world problem.'' He said that comment really came from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said he also credited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with some suggestions for possible retaliatory measures, which also had been made by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. In the other instance, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says he quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as telling Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during their <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit meeting, `` There is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.'' He said in the book that he and a press aide, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, concocted this quotation. The disclosures created an uproar among the present White House press office staff and was criticized by a broad range of professionals in the public relations business, who said it damaged his credibility. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office of the public relations firm <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> probably would be able to find a job in public relations but that it would be at a lower level and for less pay. `` He is still a major name in the business with powerful connections who made a mistake,'' she said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, president of a large New York-based firm that bears his name, said <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> is `` doing penance now. He's been very severely damaged, but he's an intelligent person and I'm sure someone would forgive him.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> successor <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who had excoriated <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> earlier in the week for the fabricated quotes, told reporters Friday, `` I'm sorry for him, personally.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he would comment no further. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, had labeled his predecessor's conduct `` a damn outrage.''

 A bankruptcy judge granted <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> an extension Friday to devise its reorganization plan, while the ministry's court-appointed trustee said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> would not be able to make a $ 5.7 million payment due May 2. The trustee, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, also said the ministry would lay off an additional 125 people. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> had been scheduled to make its first major payment May 2 to start repaying the more than $ 60 million in debts accumulated by former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. However, federal bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> gave the ministry until May 15 _ a month from Friday _ to modify its reorganization plan to include possible sale of assests to pay the debt. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> should be prepared to sell property not related to the church or its television program to pay its debts, assets the ministry had hoped to avoid parting with by holding a monthlong telethon in March on its evangelical television show. However, only $ 2.2 million was raised. `` I visualize an orderly liquidation,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` Whatever's left -LRB- of the property -RRB- would go to the ministry.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the reorganization plan might be revised to include the sale of $ 3 million to $ 4 million of undeveloped land this year. Other assets, including the Heritage Grand Hotel, could be sold as a last move, he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s director of public relations, echoed: `` If we made a list of priorities of assets that could be sold, the hotel would be the last.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, said although the May 2 payment of $ 5.7 million was scheduled to be the first payment under the reorganization plan, the ministry has managed to pay some creditors `` bills that they knew would come up under that process.'' For that reason, and because of mounting legal and administrative costs of the bankruptcy, the amount due creditors in the May 2 payment has fluctuated. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> administrators had estimated last month they would owe about $ 4.2 million. However, as of Friday the amount had risen to $ 5.7 million, she said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> the extension after a hearing on a government motion to delay the May 2 implementation of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s court-approved plan. In the motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys argued that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> remains on shaky ground with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking more than $ 55 million in back taxes. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appealed the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> reorganization plan on Dec. 29, and still opposes it. The reorganization plan anticipates that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> will qualify as tax-exempt. But so far, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has n't agreed to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s request and has warned that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> may lose its tax-exempt status.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> heart surgeon <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> was freed Friday from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, where he had been held for two years, after his conviction in the deaths of three patients was overturned on appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy-Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday that the evidence `` was simply not sufficient.'' <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, 57, was released about 11 a.m., according Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlinger </PERSON>, who said no other information about <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s plans would be released at his request. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> told military authorities that he would not meet with reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 20 days to ask the appeals court to reconsider. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, who automatically returns to active duty with his previous rank of commander, probably will be assigned to a reserve center in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> while the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decides to appeal, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Lt. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mescus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> is also eligible for $ 120,000 in back pay. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> was chief heart surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. He was convicted in 1986 of two counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of negligent homicide in the deaths of three patients. He also was convicted on 18 of 24 counts of dereliction of duty in other operations, and was sentenced to four years in prison. The appeals court said prosecutors `` lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass surgery is an inherently risky business.'' Prosecutors had argued that <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> used questionable surgical techniques, but they never produced evidence or testimony to demonstrate his work constituted criminal conduct, the appeals court said. `` We shall set aside all findings of guilty based on this factual insufficiency of the evidence,'' the court said. Prosecutors described <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> as an egocentric man who hid the fact that he was nearly blind in one eye and continued performing complex operations despite warnings that he was killing patients. The appeals court said it was troubled by <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s conviction because his court-martial involved criminal charges as opposed to civil claims for damages based on negligence. `` We are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the deaths that formed the basis of the appellant's conviction were due to any negligence, simple or otherwise, on his part,'' the appeals court said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> compared drug dealers to <LOCATION> Klansmen </LOCATION> on Friday and urged residents of a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> housing project to `` drive drugs out of your neighborhood.'' Campaigning for support in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential primary next Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> walked through <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a low-income public housing project. As he walked through the project hundreds of residents crowded around reaching out to shake his hand or, at least, touch his coat. Others waved from apartment windows. `` Ropes, sheets and hoods represent death,'' he told them, adding that `` we never lost as many lives to Southern rope'' as to drugs. `` The dope pusher, the dope trafficker, the drug warlords threaten the fabric of our lives,'' he said. `` The dope pusher does not wear sheets and hoods, the dope pusher is the hood who lives in the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The crowd cheered when he urged them to join him in an effort to rid their neighborhood of drugs. `` Our minds must rebel against the drug pusher,'' he said. `` Our attitudes must rebel against the drug pusher. Our morality must rebel against the drug pusher. `` We must drive drugs out of your neighborhood.'' From the project <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went to a drug rehabilitation center run by the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, where he said that `` as president I can substantially cut the supply of drugs, but the people must cut down the demand for drugs.'' While he spoke <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides passed out a written summary of his anti-drug proposal, which includes a $ 2 billion increase in federal spending to combat trafficking. At a breakfast meeting with community ministers, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration anti-drug efforts, as well as the positions being taken by his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals. He described <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as captains and lieutenants in the war against drugs. `` I'm the general in this war,'' he said. `` Now, everybody's fighting for the homeless,'' he went on. `` I'm a five-star general in that war.'' He said other candidates were beginning `` to focus on teenage mothers. Good, I'm the son of one.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also referred repeatedly to the shutdown of the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, a main commuter route between <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` Because of lack of investment in the infrastructure, bridges are falling,'' he said. `` We must rebuild the people even as we are rebuilding the city,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later addressed several thousand people at a gay and lesbian rally for his campaign in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. `` I stood with you because it was the right thing to do,'' he told them. His statement that `` Testing for AIDS must be voluntary and confidential'' drew loud cheers from the crowd that extended a full block along 13th Street.

<TEXT>
 As many as 100 Americans will be asked to testify at the trial of suspected <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, court officials said Friday. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, jailed in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, is charged with air piracy and the slaying of of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailor in the 1985 hijacking of a jetliner on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The hijackers held 39 Americans hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for 17 days. A spokesman for <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state court, Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehren </PERSON>, told a news conference the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government will pay expenses of Americans who appear in court. `` Maybe 100 American citizens will be asked to travel from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to testify at the trial,'' he said. Those who do n't want to travel can give sworn depositions, he added. The news conference was called to clarify why the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> case was turned over to a juvenile court by the adult state court in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> earlier this week. Court officials also used the news conference to indirectly criticize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who are calling on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to try <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as an adult. The juvenile court will determine whether to deal with <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as a juvenile, adolescent or adult, <PERSON> Kehren </PERSON> said. If the court treats the suspect as an adult, it could sentence him to life in prison upon conviction. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> could receive a maximum 10-year jail sentence if tried as a juvenile and 10 to 15 years if tried as an adolescent, <PERSON> Kehren </PERSON> said. West German law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of age, an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or over. The <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> case was turned over to the juvenile court because there is `` doubt about whether he was 21 at the time he began the process of committing the crimes he is charged with,'' the spokesman said. The trial was to begin next month, but court officials now say it will have to be put off for several months as the juvenile court studies the case and arranges for witnesses to testify. The hijacking began June 14, 1985, a day after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s 21st birthday, but officials say planning of the crime likely began before he became a legal adult. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Jan. 13, 1987, and charged with carrying liquid explosives. The court's president, Judge <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, said the case was given to the juvenile court to prevent the suspect from appealing a decision by a state adult court on the issue of his age. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` we expect ... and hope that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> will be tried and sentenced as an adult.'' But <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> told reporters, `` No outside comments will be allowed to influence the case.'' Judge <PERSON> Horst-Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, another official attending the news conference, said, `` It is dangerous for a court if there is even a mere appearance that outside considerations would be included in its decision.'' West German officials last year rejected a request that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> be extradited to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the slaying of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> during the hijacking. The decision came after two West Germans were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailor who was aboard the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> when it hit a mine in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> said Friday he heard a thunderous blast and feared he would drown as the sea rushed in around him. A hole was blasted in the side of the missile frigate and it was being towed to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> for repairs. Ten sailors remained hospitalized after the Thursday incident, and two were in critical condition. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the frigate ran into a virtual mine field in the central gulf. Department sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had dispatched four mine-sweeping ships to the area to search for more explosives. Department spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said later that two mines were spotted by the crew of a reconnaissance helicopter and the devices were destroyed by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> team. He said the mines were moored by cables to the bottom of the gulf but were visible from the air. The navy will resume the search for more mines at daylight Saturday, he added. <PERSON> Crewman </PERSON> <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, suffered a fracture of the lumbar region and lay moaning in his bed at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Salmaniya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` One minute I was sitting at the console, and the next, it was all dark and I was down below,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 38, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a lookout on duty had spotted what `` looked like a mine, and the ship had already been on general quarters -LRB- alert -RRB- for about five minutes before there was a big sound.'' `` The ship jumped up about four feet and there was water coming in. The whole place just went dark,'' Perez remembered. `` It happened so quickly ... I thought I was lost. It was all dark and all I could see was the fire from the burning engine,'' recalled <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. `` I was in water ... I thought I was going to drown ... finally someone saw me and pulled me out of the water.'' The incident, about 55 miles off <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, revived fears of the mine threat in the waterway where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war for 7 -LCB- years. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships escort American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway to protect them from Iranian attacks. On July 21, during one of the escort convoys, the tanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> hit a mine in the gulf. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> successfully maneuvered away from several mines and had come to nearly a complete stop when the explosion occurred. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the field had `` numerous'' mines and that the seas were rough. `` At one point, there was 12 feet of water inside the engine room,'' said one official. `` The crew just did a hell of a job. She -LRB- the ship -RRB- took a really bad hit.'' It was n't known who planted the mines, but one <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said they appeared to have been newly laid and added, `` We certainly suspect the Iranians are behind it.'' <LOCATION> Salmaniya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said two of the injured were in critical condition with second degree burns to 40 percent of their bodies. Another was suffering from second degree burns to 15 percent of his body. The other injured sailors were suffering from shock and were under observation aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> combat stores ship <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships rushed to aid the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Together with the crew of the stricken frigate, these warships conducted a nightlong salvage operation. They pumped the water out and patched the hole, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the 3,700-ton USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was in no danger of sinking. The ship, based in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, left for gulf duty Jan. 11 with about 225 men aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that warplanes bombed nine Iranian cities, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 24 civilians were killed. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian gunners fired six short-range missiles at `` military and economic centers'' in Iraqi border towns. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes raided the nine cities, mainly in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired six short-range missiles into the port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities.

<HEAD>EPA Plans No Short-Term Sulfur Dioxide Limits Around Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to adopt air quality standards that would protect asthmatics around power plants and other sources from brief bursts of sulfur dioxide. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> insisted it made the decision solely because it considered health gains to be marginal, and did not consider at all the huge costs that such a standard would impose on the utility industry. The agency estimated that 100,000 asthmatics live within 12 miles of a coal-burning power plant and might be exposed for one hour per year to a burst of sulfur dioxide, and only about a quarter of those would show any reaction. It had no estimate of the number of people living near other potential sources such as industrial boilers. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, assistant administrator for air programs, said the agency decided not to act because of the `` reversible, transitory effects'' involved for `` a fairly small number of individuals'' who `` if sensitive to these kinds of exposures are likely sensitive to other kinds of exposures and have medication'' that would protect them. Nonetheless, the agency asked for public comment on whether it should adopt a one-hour sulfur dioxide standard of 0.4 parts per million. Environmentalists denounced the decision, which <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said `` starkly emphasizes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's preference for protecting the polluters' profits rather than public health.'' From industry, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullan </PERSON>, environmental specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Medical people coming to us are finding that there is adequate control under current standards.'' Outdoor concentration standards aimed at protecting health are by statute required to be set without considering costs. Asked what criteria the agency was using to make what <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> admitted was a `` tough call,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards said a new standard would `` disrupt an ongoing regulatory program'' and <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said the agency had to consider the best use of its own resources. `` When you compare it -LRB- a short-term sulfur dioxide standard -RRB- with other problems, with ozone, there is no comparison,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said excessive ozone damages the lung structures irreversibly, something sulfur dioxide does not do in brief exposures. A one-hour standard of 0.4 ppm to 0.5 ppm would probably require fossil-fueled utilities to reduce annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by 6 million tons, and a 0.2 ppm to 0.3 ppm standard would require reductions of 10 million tons to 11 million tons, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. The larger figure is roughly half the current national total and about the reductions called for in some bills being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to control the precursors of acid rain, of which sulfur dioxide is an important one. The <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that a 0.2 ppm one-hour standard would cost the industry $ 5 billion a year, but a 0.8 ppm standard might be accommodated without major disruption. The other sulfur dioxide standards are not expected to be changed, the agency said in announcing that it would take comment from the public for 120 days before a formal decision.

 Police said Friday they believe a Japanese terrorist accused of attacking Western embassies around the world parked a bomb-laden car outside the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> USO </ORGANIZATION> club, killing an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicewoman and four Italians. Two Arab groups claimed responsibility for the explosion Thursday night in a narrow street that runs past the the club, where a party was being held to welcome destroyer USS <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to port. Seventeen people were wounded, including four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors. All five people killed were just outside the USO. They included <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who held the rank of radioman 3rd class and was based at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> Master Station in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. A man speaking accented English telephoned a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency office in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Friday and said the bomb was planted by a group called <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigades </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imperialists must die today, two years after their barbarous attack against the Libyan Arab state,'' he said. His reference was to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on April 15, 1986, which was intended to punish the Arab nation for alleged sponsorship of international terrorism. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a statement signed by a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the Support of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> said it `` claims responsibility for the attack launched by our brethren holy warriors in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> against American targets in the city of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> in which several imperialist soldiers were killed or wounded.'' The typewritten statement, in Arabic, was delivered to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> bureau of the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>. Its language indicated the group was made up of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> denied involvement in the bombing by Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s government. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a bomb exploded Friday at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radio relay station near an air base east of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. It caused no injuries, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said. No group claimed responsibility. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official was quoted by the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> as saying the attack could be related to the anniversary of the <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> raids. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday night that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent a cable to all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies warning of possible attacks by terrorists, but department spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said he was unaware of any such communication. Italian investigators said Friday that <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has links to terrorists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was the prime suspect in the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> attack. An international arrest warrant was issued for him Friday. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ansoino </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreassi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s anti-terrorist police said they believed <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, 39, had accomplices. They said both claims of responsibility were being taken seriously. A law enforcement source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bomb squad left for <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> to investigate whether the explosives used there are similar to those found in the car of a Japanese man arrested Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. State authorities detained <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, after he was found with three bombs in his car and a phony visa. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reported that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> had links to the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON> said the agency has offered Italian authorities its cooperation but he refused to confirm that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> team had been dispatched. In December, <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> was charged in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with bomb and rocket attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British embassies in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in June during the annual summit of Western leaders in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. Several people were wounded. He is believed responsible for similar attacks on Western embassies in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> in 1975 and the French Embassy in The Hague in 1974. <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> is believed to be the man who parked the explosives-laden car in front of the USO club. It detonated during a party attended by sailors from the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and USS Capodanno. Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, said the party was in the basement, which made casualties lower. The explosives were packed into the trunk of a rented white Ford Fiesta. <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON> said police believed <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, identified through witness descriptions, had fled <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and likely left the country. Investigators said <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> five days, staying at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pietro </LOCATION>, a modest hotel near the railroad station, under a false name. Hotel officials said he left Thursday after paying his bill. <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> officials declared a day of mourning for Saturday, when funerals will be held for the four Italians. The street in front of the USO still was littered with glass and burned-out cars Friday. Only the mangled front end remained of the car that exploded. Inside the club were blackened walls, patches of blood, burned shoes and pieces of clothing. Still intact on one wall was a sign reading `` USO Welcomes USS Capodanno and USS Paul.''

 Procrastinators and folks simply trying to forestall the inevitable _ taxes, that is _ made their annual trek to the post office Friday to mail their 1040 forms. `` This happens every year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, mail supervisor at the Willkes-Barre, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, post office. `` I think it's terrible that people have to wait for the last minute,'' <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> said. `` People call you today and ask you at the last minute if you have tax forms in your office. And we do n't.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of Mr. Tax of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said at 7 p.m. that his firm had 10 customers left with appointments before the midnight filing deadline. `` My last one is at 8:30, which I expect to finish about 11 p.m.,'' he said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, regional manager for <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R Block in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said he sees the same people, year after year, in the waning hours of tax season. `` They look forward to the excitement of April 15th. The adrenalin starts flowing,'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said. `` It's like a non-contact sport.'' Postal Service consumer advocate <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the post office expected to handle 30 million tax returns nationwide in the `` last couple of days'' before the deadline. Post offices across the country were open until midnight to place the all-important April 15 postmark on tax returns, or on envelopes containing Form 4868 requesting an automatic four-month extension of the deadline. `` We expect thousands to be here tonight,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> said Friday at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s main post office. Tables and chairs were set up for those serious procrastinators who arrived with their forms still blank. <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' center in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said 450,000 returns arrived Friday morning with more on the way. In past years, the center has received some strange returns such as a coffin filled with dollar bills and checks written on edible underpants. This year, she said, the center's 5,500 employees found nothing unusual. `` So far it's just paper, paper, paper, tons of paper,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. `` It looks like a wagon train of paper.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> taxpayers got a chance to vent their anger by throwing luscious whipped cream pies at a mock <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent dubbed `` Shirdolph Yurback,'' also known as <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, part-owner of the Superior Street Cafe. `` You know what I'm going to do with your taxes?'' he taunted one passerby. `` I'm going to fund a study of South American insects.'' At $ 1 to $ 2 a throw, the stunt raised a couple hundred dollars for a non-profit group for mentally retarded adults, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. It was party time in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where the post office laid on a six-piece band, dancing raisins and a singing letter carrier in a costume which was half <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, half regulation blue. His song: `` Return to Sender.'' `` It's become a tradition,'' said <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Postmaster <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, who decided in 1983 to liven up a long night and ease the pain by offering free coffee and music April 15. This year a radio station threw in free sandwiches. More than 7,000 tax returns were processed between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., according to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the post office. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazer </PERSON>, communications manager for the postal service in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said no extra workers were called in Friday though some employees would work overtime. `` Believe it or not, with automation, we can handle this additional volume of mail with no problems,'' <PERSON> Mazer </PERSON> said. `` It is really not that difficult for us. We do this every year as a public service. ... We live in a world of people who do things at the last minute.'' In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> concocted an 800-pound cake decorated like an 11-foot-long Form 1040 and invited people to `` take a bite'' out of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. Deadline Day publicity stunts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> included free samples of antacid which were distributed outside the main post office, and an `` IRS Stress Relief Clinic'' opened by a toy company, which invited taxpayers to come in and yell at a dummy. In <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 15 protesters from <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> displayed a missile made of income tax forms outside a federal office building. They also erected a structure of cans of food they said they would donate to the poor in lieu of paying taxes for military purposes. State tax officials in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> reported a pleasant surprise in their mail Friday _ cashiers' checks totaling $ 82,000 from a penitent but anonymous tax evader. `` Please forgive our mistakes and shortcomings,'' said a short note, which explained that the names on the checks were not real. `` Maybe so,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, `` but the money is.''

 The number of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> planes grounded by safety violations grew to at least 15 Friday as a federal crackdown found problems including a fuel leak, a missing maintenance log and a cracked wing flap, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union said. The airline and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm the number, saying they will detail no violations until the inspection is complete. As of Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had put the number of planes grounded at six. `` They did n't want to see a running box score,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said of his agency's policy change after two days. The unprecedented inspection of all Eastern planes began after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> slapped the company with a $ 823,000 fine for safety violations. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said officials have been unsatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s performance since its 1986 takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also will undergo a 30-day inspection of its operating practices. Eight planes were found to have safety violations Friday according to reports from union members around the country, said a union spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of company retaliation. The latest groundings were in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the union spokesman said. Planes grounded by safety violations can be returned to service once they are repaired. In addition, union officials said a 757 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was grounded on Wednesday and its passengers ordered off minutes before the flight was to take off for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because the airline had failed to repair fire-detection wiring in an engine a week and two warnings after it was reported by an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspector. Four planes were briefly sidelined Friday in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for violations ranging from a seat on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 that reclined to block an emergency exit to a wheel well leak on a DC-9, the union said. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> an A-300 <ORGANIZATION> AirBus </ORGANIZATION> was sidelined Friday with a wing flap dent and a fuel leak in an engine. The plane was fixed later in the day, the union said. A <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> flight to <LOCATION> Miamia </LOCATION> was held for repairs Friday morning, the union said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was found to have a cracked wing flap. Late Thursday, DC-9 bound for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was taken out of service after <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors found it lacked a flight maintenance log and was missing landing bumper pads. In <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, the battery relay switch on a DC-9 was found not to be working. The switch turns on the plane's electrical equipment, the union spokesman said. A DC-9 taken out of service at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> when inspectors discovered a duct in the tail section was overheating, the union spokesman said. The eight Friday groundings were in addition to six the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reported on Thursday and the one reported to have taken place Wednesday. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said about 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 267-plane fleet had been looked over by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors in 23 cities when the agency stopped reporting its findings Friday morning. Inspections were expected to continue as flights arrived in those cities during the 30-day review that began Wednesday. Eastern spokewoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said news of the sidelined planes was being overblown. Some mechanical problems occur daily, she said.

 `` Colors,'' the much criticized movie about <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' out-of-control street gangs, opened nationwide Friday at 425 theaters amid protests and tight security following predictions of audience violence. It also drew mixed reviews. About 15 theaters nationwide dropped plans to show the film, according to reports, and at some <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> theaters, police frisked young people as they entered. Afternoon showings went off without incident at the busy <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> theater. `` It has just been business as usual,'' said manager <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnell </PERSON>. The theater added security guards for the film's opening, but that was more in anticipation of the crowds than out of fear of violence, <PERSON> Schnell </PERSON> said. The line for an afternoon show snaked a block down <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, police said they planned to assign at least a dozen officers to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Warner Theater. <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> is just a few miles from <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION>, home area of several gangs. `` There could be some fights inside the theater,'' said <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>. `` We're taking this seriously. We'll have officers inside the theater and officers outside.'' `` There will be gang members there,'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. `` Definitely. No doubt about it.'' Between Jan. 1 and April 4, there were 89 gang-related deaths in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths in the area. The management of the Laemmle Grand theater near the Sheraton Grand Hotel, just a short distance from gang turf, decided not to show the film after staffers pleaded for their safety. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who asked not to be identified told the <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> Progress-Bulletin a decision was made several weeks ago to pull the movie from some UA theaters, including one in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, where police in the past two years have staged two major raids against drugs and gangs. Two real <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs, the Crips and Bloods, and their respective colors of blue and red, are depicted in the movie that stars <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> as two officers assigned to fight the gangs. The Orion movie was directed by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, who spent the week defending the film against critics such as the Hollywood-Beverly Hills Chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who suggested it should not be shown anywhere. `` I'm showing you a real problem that exists,'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said Friday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` When you show a real problem that exists, you do n't go to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and try to get the movie dismissed.'' Hopper's home in the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> area was picketed during the week by the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based civilian crime-fighting organization. The Guardian <PERSON> Angels </PERSON> also handed out pamphlets Friday to theater-goers at the UA Coronet in the fashionable Westwood section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>. `` We are not going to stop anyone from seeing the movie. But we are going to be exercising our constitutional right to protest it,'' he said. The Angels also set up a picket line in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> outside the large <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, just off Times Square. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the founder of a group called <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gangs </ORGANIZATION> praised and criticized `` Colors,'' saying adults should see the film. `` A movie has appeared that makes us all witnesses to the daily horrors of gang wars,'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said at a news conference. The film `` has done what hundreds of pleading, crying and angry voices of mothers of victims of gang violence could not. It has drawn national attention to the brutal reality facing our youth.'' However, she criticized the film for not showing the after-effects of gang violence. `` When a child is murdered it is not all over,'' she said. `` It is the beginning of a living nightmare for the family ... for the mothers.'' Late Thursday a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> patrolman said all 14 unit officers assigned to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> would be instructed to stick close to a theater showing the movie and would be on `` radio alert,'' ready to help out if any violence were to occur. The patrolman would not identify himself. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and city of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> special units were on alert but did not expect violence. `` Our gang unit is going to go to the theater to see the movie, then hang out to identify more gang members,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>. `` But I do n't think they are going to have any incidents. Reviews were mixed, with many critics focusing not on the violence but on the time-worn `` old-cop, young-cop'' conflict between <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>'s and <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s character. `` The most shocking thing about the film is not that the movie glorifies gang violence _ it does n't _ but that it's about as conventional as an ` Adam-12' episode,'' <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> film critic <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> wrote. But The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> `` has a superb eye for the poisonous flower of gang culture amid ghetto life,'' and noted also that while the movie was accused of glorifying gang violence `` its sense of frustration is much too strong to support that claim.'' Los Angeles Times' critic <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> called it `` a disappointingly superficial'' movie.

 A psychologist was indicted Friday on charges of submitting false data to win a $ 200,000 federal research grant. A federal prosecutor said the charges were the first of their kind in the nation. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON>, 35, was charged in connection with a grant received in 1982 from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> while he was a faculty member at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The money already has been repaid by the university, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Breckinridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON>, now director of psychological services and behavorial treatment at the Polk Center in <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, submitted a 1981 grant request for a study titled `` Stimulant Drug Use with Mentally Retarded Children'' while at the university from 1982 to 1984, the statement said. The indictment said <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON>'s applications cited the results of seven studies of hyperactive mentally retarded children. <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> `` knew the ... studies had not been completed at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> as described,'' and that `` the studies that were ongoing were not obtaining the results as described,'' the indictment said. <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said that the indictment is believed to be first time criminal charges have been brought against an individual in connection with falsified research. `` We have ... addressed a problem that I suspect is more widespread than we think: fraudulent research data in the medical field,'' <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said. `` Let this investigation send a clear message to doctors and researchers who play fast and loose with their research that they will have to deal with the criminal justice system in addition to their peer review panels.'' In addition to two counts of making false statements, <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> was charged with obstructing a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> investigation by falsely testifying at a 1985 hearing that he had submitted a `` corrected version'' of his grant request. `` We vehemently deny the allegations and think they're patently untrue,'' <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON> said by telephone from his <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> home Friday night. If convicted, <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate in psychology from the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, could receive up to 10 years in prison and $ 20,000 in fines on the false statement counts, and five years and $ 250,000 in fines on the obstruction count, officials said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, was not available for comment, a university employee said Friday night.

 Relatives of victims of the 1980 <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising threw rocks at presidential security guards in a cemetery Friday as President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo visited the city. Students supporting striking workers battled police at campuses around the country. Dissident sources in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> said the attack followed rumors <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> might visit <LOCATION> Mangwoldong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, where many of the victims are buried. Thousands of troops were mobilized to quell the May 1980 uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> that left at least 191 people dead and more than 800 others wounded. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the Korean news agency, said about 50 family members of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> victims hurled rocks at five presidential security guards inspecting the cemetery, seized their radio sets and smashed windows of their minibus. Dissident sources said hundreds of riot police were deployed around the cemetery immediately after Friday's attack and police maintained tight security in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, the political base of opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> did not visit the cemetary. However, he did apologize for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident on behalf of the government and urged citizens to bury their anger and work to build national harmony. `` I will do my best to restore the honor of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> citizens,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told 300 regional leaders at a city government office. The government officially apologized early this month for the killings at <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and offered to make compensations for its victims. Thousands of students backing striking workers clashed with riot police throughout the country. There were no reports of injuries or arrests. Talks on reopening <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s second largest shipyard and car plant bogged down Friday and labor unrest spread to other businesses. The facilities are owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> group, one of the country's largest conglomerates. An official with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said eight new strikes broke out Friday, raising to 349 the total number of disputes reported so far this year. Of these, 266 disputes have been settled and 83 others were continuing, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>

 Debate over whether the Oscar-winning film, `` The Last Emperor,'' was filmed illegally in the Imperial Palace was a hot topic in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature this week. Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> called on Vice Minister of Culture <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruocheng </PERSON> to give his account of the affair, according to a report earlier this week in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Evening News -LRB- <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Wanbao -RRB-. Ying, an accomplshed actor, was closely involved with the film directed by <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> played the supporting role of warden in the war criminals prison where the emperor is sent for `` remolding and education.'' The film crew used Imperial Palace buildings to shoot interior scenes, but filming is forbidden in the palace under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s historical preservation law The law, which took effect in April 1985, is aimed at protecting wooden structures from irreparable fire damage. During the 1 -LCB- - hour question-and-answer session held Monday, <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> told delegates that the contract with the Italian film company was signed in March 1984, before the preservation law was issued, the daily said In addition, he cited the value of propagating <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cultural heritage through film and assurances that the film company would use fire prevention measures, the paper said. The director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimin </PERSON>, also defended the filming in the palace. `` In light of the contract being signed first and, moreover, a letter from officials of the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> requesting help and cooperation, we decided to make this a special case.'' Some congressional delegates complained that the treatment of the foreign film makers was an affront to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s attempts to develop a modern legal system and establish `` rule by law.'' `` In the final analysis, did the contract obey the law or overturn it?'' <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province delegate <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuang </PERSON> was quoted as asking. The debate was triggered when producers of an all-Chinese film crew making a television series, also entitled `` The Last Emperor,'' wrote a letter to a government advisory body in March complaining that they had been denied access to palace buildings. `` Is law greater in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, or is power? Do foreigners have to obey our laws or not?'' the letter asked. The letter appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to `` criticize and halt unhealthy tendencies and to reaffirm the integrity of Chinese lawmaking.'' According to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Evening News report, <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruocheng </PERSON> and his colleagues promised that film or television crews would not be given special privileges again. The delegates ended their annual session on Wednesday. The Chinese media has reported with little comment the awarding of nine Academy Awards, including best picture, to `` The Last Emperor.'' The film has not reached Chinese theaters.

 She never went to acting school, but <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> has managed to convey high-voltage excitement in such films as `` Dona Flora and Her Two Husbands'' and `` Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' Now she's doing the same in <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s `` The Milagro Beanfield War.'' <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, a tenacious garage owner who organizes a civic revolt against the land marauders of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> village. It's another remarkable performance for the actress who began her career in Brazilian soap operas Here for the opening of `` The Milagro Beanfield War,'' <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> recently talked about her career in an interview that covered a wide range of subjects, usually in brief bursts of conversation. Her English is amazingly good, considering her recent acquaintance with the language. `` I started learning English about four years ago,'' she said. `` I went to visit a friend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and since I was n't doing anything at the time, ... I decided to stay and learn the language. I'm glad that I did that. Language can be a big barrier between people. If you want to know a people, you have to learn the language.'' The actress first heard about `` Milagro'' while she was serving on the jury of the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> three years ago. Her agent told her that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> wanted to talk with her about a role in the film. On her way home to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> she stopped in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I read the script and I really, really loved it,'' she said. `` Then I met <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, and we talked. I was too excited about the character to be nervous. I was very, very touched that someone would want to make a movie about ` Milagro.' `` Then I made a screen test three times. I had three or four more interviews with the producers and the director. Then I went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' In the movie, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> hamlet is being squeezed to death by a resort developer with the help of the state governor and his venal staff. The officials even send a hatchet man to terrorize the residents, mostly Hispanic, when they grow restive under the rape of their land. The reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner who inadvertently diverts the land baron's water into his beanfield. He becomes defiant, and others strive to make it a crusade, especially <PERSON> Braga </PERSON>. What's it like to be directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>? `` He's very sensitive,'' <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> said. `` I think that's not only because he's an actor and he understands the problems of actors. That's the quality that some people have. He is very into certain important things, like the environment. `` He is totally open to suggestion. If you're doing well, he'll just let you go For instance, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Blades </PERSON> -LRB- who plays Sheriff <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> -RRB- is a natural actor. He was so much the character that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> just watched him do it. But when he sees that you are going the wrong way, he leads you back to the right way for the movie. If you have any suggestions about the character, he will listen to you and make some changes.'' The dark-haired beauty has been working since she was 14. After playing children, she did a production of `` Hair'' for two years. `` Then I started doing soap operas,'' she said. `` One of the soap operas, ` <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON>,' was written by <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Amada </PERSON>, who also wrote ` Dona Flor.''' The film brought her international acclaim, as did `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' her first film in English. She welcomes more opportunities abroad since the Brazilian film industry has been ailing because of the country's financial woes. The country's major filmmakers have abandoned <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, making movies in English instead of <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Babenco </PERSON> -LRB- `` Kiss of the Spider Woman'' -RRB- shot `` Ironweed'' with Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, N.Y.

<HEAD>Brazil's Slum Theaters Tell of Shantytown Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LISA GENASCI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new kind of community theater is drawing attention to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s shantytown slums, where residents are telling the story of their grim reality through plays. Slum theater is a sharp break from the mainly white, European-influenced fare of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s theaters. Its supporters hope it will bring greater artistic recognition for popular culture, which in the past has meant little more than Carnival samba. `` Popular theater has become the most important movement within Brazilian theater. It's exciting to see a hidden people expressing themselves,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, the city's secretary of culture, in an interview. In the past three years, the city government has helped to start theater groups in most of greater Rio's 434 slums, which are home to an estimated 4 million of the metropolitan area's 10.3 million residents. One group is in the Manguinhos slum, or `` favela'' in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s language. Like other favelas, <PERSON> Manguinhos </PERSON> is a jumble of slapped-together wood or tin shanties, inhabited mostly by blacks earning close to the official minimum wage of about $ 50 a month. Three times a week, 26 residents meet for a two-hour rehearsal in a newly built community center. The characters in the play are a common slum family: a mother who takes in washing to support the family; an unemployed father who drinks and gambles away the meager income; a son wanted by the police; a daughter who is raped by the landlord when the family can not pay the rent on its two-room shack. In the play, the family's luck changes when the father wins the lottery and becomes a slumlord himself. He buys up shacks, expels former friends, builds a mansion in the slum and finally moves out to the fashionable <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> district, cutting ties with the favela. Although most of the actors have full-time jobs and many study at night, few miss rehearsals. `` I go crazy on nights when there is no rehearsal,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>, 29, who plays the landlord. The play later was to enter an amateur theater competition and travel for performances in neighboring slums. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Chediak </PERSON> is a pioneer in the popular theater movement. He has helped to form some 200 groups in favelas around <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. The first obstacle to starting a group, he said, is to convince the community he is not with the police. Another challenge is coping with interruptions such as gang wars, police raids and weddings. `` We try to give people a sense of their own value and teach them to respect their community through theather,'' <PERSON> Chediak </PERSON> said in an interview. The plays often start as personal recollections or stories about slum life, which then are woven in to drama. <PERSON> Chediak </PERSON> trains his students to collect these oral histories. One of his pupils is <PERSON> Yvete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>, a 25-year-old drama school graduate, who is starting a group in the Cascatinha, or Little Waterfall, slum. <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> recorded seven full tapes of interviews with the slum's older residents. The tapes later became the basis for a play of several sketches telling the story of the community. `` People are creative but closed after years of repression of popular culture. My job is to pull this creativity out of them,'' she said. Some see slum theater as a step toward independence from outside influences, especially from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> which has overshadowed theater here ever since Spanish Jesuit missionaries first used morality plays to evangelize native Indians more than 400 years ago. `` Popular theater is more Brazilian than anything we've seen,'' said <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendonca </PERSON>, who has directed slum theater groups as well as conventional plays. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, visting European troupes set the model for Brazilian drama. During World War II, a wave of talented European directors came to this country to flee the turmoil. In the 1950s, some young groups tried to turn Brazilian theater toward national themes. But a 1964 right-wing military coup imposed sweeping censorship and was especially harsh on community theater, which was considered subversive. The military regime ended in 1985. Slum theater also is a forum for discussing community action projects. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, a 24-year-old actress in the Cascatinha group, said residents often use the rehearsals to discuss how to obtain electricity, running water, paved streets and other services the government has not provided for poor areas.

<HEAD>NBC Documentary Examines Life in Women's Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A TV program called `` Women Behind Bars'' sounds like some cheap attempt to boost ratings, but it's an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> documentary that turns out to be a sophisticated examination of a growing social problem. Unlike the stereotypes of tough tootsies that exploitation movies foster, correspondent <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> reports in the one-hour documentary Tuesday night that most women in prison are there for economic crimes like hot-check writing or welfare fraud and that most are single mothers with children under age 3. Once in prison, the only job training they are likely to get will prepare them for low-paying jobs as cosmetologists, domestics or food servers. In the meantime, their families are uprooted and their children put in foster homes. For `` Women Behind Bars,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> went to <ORGANIZATION> Dwight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and talked to inmates who, in fact, are rarely behind bars. At first glance, <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> notes, the institution looks like the campus of an all-girls college. Inmates stay in rooms, not cells, though they are locked in at night. `` The time you do here is mental time,'' says one inmate. The inmate says she's seen the prison's population triple in the seven years she's been there. `` Equal opportunity has brought women the equal opportunity to go to jail,'' says <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>. The institutions lag behind society in enlightened views of women's roles and appropriate behavior. A warden notes that female inmates are more likely to be reported for minor misbehavior, such as insolence, than are men, because women are expected to be `` ladies.'' Instead of preparing women for the challenge of returning to their communities, getting jobs and taking charge of their lives, women's prisons tend to make female inmates more dependent, as opposed to men's prisons where inmates are likely to become more violent. <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> asks one women who has been imprisoned several times why anyone take a chance that could send them back. Back home, without support, says the inmate, `` you're going to do something to survive, no matter what the consequences.'' The biggest problem for women in prison is the separation from their children. Sometimes they do n't even know who is raising them. As interviews with weeping inmates attest, women in jail care just as much about their children as women anywhere. One young woman has just arrived to begin serving a 13-month sentence for burglary. She is five months pregnant and has two children in a foster home. When the baby is born it, too, will go to the foster home. `` They'll be too young to remember _ I hope,'' says the woman. If they get to visit mom in jail, children can be further traumatized. The cameras show a 3-year-old boy being searched by a prison guard. Another small boy, when asked `` where's mama?'', points to the foster mother who brought him, not the real mother who is sitting next to him. Children wail when they are again wrenched from their mothers at the end of visiting hours. Of the one in five women who are serving long sentences for violent crimes, many were battered wives who killed their husbands, <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> says. Again, contrary to stereotype, they are unthreatening and stay in lower-security blocks. Statistics show most are middle-class and unlikely to commit another crime once released. In prison, they do their time quietly. Maximum security, <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> reports, is occupied mostly by younger inmates with long criminal records, even if the individual crimes are not especially severe. Repeat offenders are more likely to be rebellious. Violent inmates are put in `` segregation,'' left alone in a room. One tough inmate spends her time in solitary writing poignant essays about prison life. `` Prison is a place,'' she writes, `` where you learn nobody needs you, and the world goes on without you.''

 Unless you obtained an extension, your income tax returns are now behind you, leaving time to dwell upon the myriad thoughts that had entered your mind and then fled because of deadline stress. Such as: Did n't <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pass what it called a tax cut? Were n't the returns supposed to have been simplified Is it really possible for anyone to file a number-perfect return _ that is, without paying too much or too little? And: If those people who are trained by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to interpret the tax code can not reach agreement among themselves, how can justice be dispensed? And if it can not, how can faith in the system be maintained? But these questions do n't even deal with the problem having perhaps the greatest economic significance of all: How can the nation tolerate the lost time, the lost creativity and energy, the lost productivity of it all? <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 100 million taxpayers have spent at least 2 billion hours preparing for and making out their state and federal tax returns, according to estimates by a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> professor. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slemrod </PERSON>, director of the school's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, estimates the bill for complying with state and federal tax laws totals as much as $ 27 billion this year. It averages about $ 275 a household. It might be noted that this effort, no matter how measured, was n't expended on making a better production line, inventing a product, improving health, teaching a student, aiding the needy, building a house or exporting a product. Essentially, although perhaps not totally, it was non-productive. And maybe regressive as well. <PERSON> Slemrod </PERSON> found that the lowest income class had relatively higher compliance costs than the highest income group. -LRB- However, the tax reform legislation did drop 6 million low-income individuals off the tax rolls by increasing the standard deduction and personal exemption. -RRB- While <PERSON> Slemrod </PERSON>'s numbers might seem high, most likely they are not. His research was conducted on a group of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> residents who filed state and federal income tax returns for 1982, well before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. He found that back then it took a taxpayer 21.7 hours a year to complete taxes, two-thirds of that time being devoted to record-keeping, one-tenth to research and one-fifth to filling in the blanks on the form. He did not, it seems, take into account the amount of time that some of these people might subsequently have spent in defending their returns during audits, nor the average cost of maintaining storage and work space in the home. The lost productivity involved in such activities might make any other dollar figures from such studies seem minor. True, a lot of people would have used the time sleeping, but conceivably that made them more productive the following day _ certainly more so than the worker who spent the night on taxes. The route to resolving this annual dilemma is n't easy; in fact, it might involve as many dead ends and reverse turns as the ordinary taxpayer faces in getting to the bottom line _ the line where he or she finds the taxable income. For example, simpler is n't necessarily better, says the professor, simply because simpler can be unfair. `` To be fair and effective, there must be a certain amount of complication,'' he says. The level of frustration might be read on a blood pressure gauge when you realize that simply to change to a simpler system might only compound the problem, since everyone would have to learn the brand-new system. But in the name of economic productivity, millions of Americans today might agree that there must be a better route to the bottom line on the tax form.

 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> announces its fall schedule next month, and `` Wiseguy'' producer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> is asking viewers to write to the network to make sure the undercover agent drama is n't left off the list. CBS is finishing last this season for the first time, so major changes are in store for next fall. Now is the time for viewers to speak out, says <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>. Viewer campaigns have saved other shows, notably `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' and `` Designing Women.'' `` You've got a network under a certain amount of pressure right now to perform, and we're trying to convince them that some of the shows they have, this one included, can do the job for them,'' said <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, which he said was stacked with almost 2,000 pieces of mail. `` I've never had a show that drew mail like this one, and it is n't stuff written in <LOCATION> Crayola </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, who has produced and written such hits as `` The Rockford Files'' and `` The A-Team.'' <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> is sending the letters to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> and appealing to viewers to write <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> directly. `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and all the people at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> really love the show, so it's not a matter of them saying, ` We do n't see it,''' said <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> `` They're sort of scratching their heads, too, and saying, ` How can we make this thing happen?' I just want to make sure ` Wiseguy' does n't fall through the cracks as management screening starts. `` Wiseguy'' is among the best dramas on network television and one of CBS' best shows. But in its premiere season it got low ratings, because of continuing plotlines but especially because of time slots. It started out Thursday nights opposite <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s top-rated comedy lineup, then moved to Monday nights where it was frequently up against miniseries and movies on the two other networks or pre-empted by miniseries on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. The premise of the show is daring. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Terranova </PERSON>, a government agent who goes deep undercover into crime organizations. Such investigations take years in real life. On `` Wiseguy'' they take several weeks, an eternity on network television where viewers are likely to be put off by a continuing storyline, figuring if they missed the first few episodes, they wo n't be able to catch up. <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> would solve that problem next season by bringing viewers up to date before each episode. This season, the first eight episodes featured <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> crime boss <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON>, a villain so likable <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> flirted occasionally with crossing the line between cop and criminal. After <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> was vanquished in a two-part conclusion that would have made a respectable theatrical release, enter a new villain, alternately charming and lunatic <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Profitt </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> is hoping the show will rack up some Emmy Awards this summer the way <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hill Street Blues'' did after almost getting canceled for low ratings its first season. `` Wiseguy'' has a number of likely nominees for acting Emmys, including <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>, plus <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, who in the <PERSON> Profitt </PERSON> storyline played <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lococco </PERSON>, hit man with a heart of gold. Another likely candidate is series regular <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> who has turned <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McPike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON>'s irascible boss, into one of the most intriguing supporting characters on television. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was set to start running repeats of the <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON> `` arc,'' as the show's producers call each storyline, but pulled the episodes to await a decision on whether the show will be renewed. If it is picked up, <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will rerun the episodes this summer in the show's new time period to help it build an audience. `` Wiseguy'' fans will have their VCRs ready.

<HEAD>Fred Silverman's Programming Instinct Still Working</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>'s famed `` golden gut'' instinct as a television programmer still seems to be in working order. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, former network wunderkind, now an independent producer, got CBS to move his faltering series, `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman,'' to Wednesdays. In the most recent ratings period the show had jumped to 21st place, up from 43rd the week before. The show also won the time period, beating <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Year in the Life'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hooperman'' and `` Just in Time.'' `` If you have a show with inherent strength, it's to everyone's advantage to try to save it,'' <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said in an interview `` The time period can be as important as the show itself. ` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman' had been on on Tuesdays, where it was up against <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s ` Moonlighting' and later <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s ` Hunter.' It was tough competition and we had no lead-in to speak of.'' The lead-in for `` Hunter'' is another <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> show, `` Matlock.'' And if `` Jake'' stayed on Tuesday nights, its competition would be a third <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> series, `` In the Heat of the Night,'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> was head of programming at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when it was No. 1 in the ratings in the 1970s. He moved to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> as entertainment president in 1975, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was soon the ratings winner for the first time. The `` golden gut'' tag came from his acknowledged decision-making on gut reaction. In 1978, he became president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, but in three years was unable to budge the network out of third place. After <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, he started his own production company. Besides the three network series, his company also produces the highly successful `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' movies for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. He also plans to bring back `` <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Law,'' the 1963-66 ABC series starring <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, as a series of TV movies. He is working on a movie series for Home Box Office about a former cop who becomes a lawyer, a role he says would be good for <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>. `` My area of greatest expertise at the networks was the half-hour comedies,'' said <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. `` I want to get into comedies. Most of the shows in syndication are comedies that I developed at the networks.'' In `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> stars as J.L. `` Fatman'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, a tough district attorney. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> is <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Styles </PERSON>, his smooth and mysterious special investigator. The show made its debut last September. `` My feeling is that when you change a show to a new day and time it takes about a month to settle in,'' said <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. `` The history of television has shown that sometimes you can save a failing show by moving it to a new time period. It's more than just wishful thinking. ` Bonanza' was on Saturday against ` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>' its first two years It barely survived, but <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> wanted to keep it on because it was in color and was helping to sell color sets. `` Then <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> moved it to Sunday nights at 9 o'clock. After that it was in first place or near first for the next 10 years. ` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show' floundered its first year on Tuesdays. It was a <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble show and they insisted it get a shot in another time period. It became a hit on Wednesdays.'' `` All in the Family,'' `` M-A-S-H,'' `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Five-0'' and `` Cannon'' were also shows that benefited by a time change. `` ` All in the Family' started on Tuesday nights between ` Hee Haw' and ` The CBS News Hour,''' said <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. `` I do n't think anybody had any great faith in it. But we were having trouble with a show on Saturday night and moved ` All in the Family.' It just exploded. `` ` M-A-S-H' just died on Sunday night, then it was moved to Saturday behind ` All in the Family.' It became second in the ratings. ` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Five-0' did n't do well until <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> switched it with ` The <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> Show.' ` Cannon' started at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, where it was up against the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie and ` <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Welby </PERSON>, M.D.' The next year we moved it to Wednesday and it became a hit.

<HEAD>Peter Ustinov Plays Beethoven's Ghost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUERGEN METKEMEYER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, whose roles have ranged from <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> the Elephant to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s mad emperor <PERSON> Nero </PERSON>, is now playing <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s ghost before packed houses in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The play, `` <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Tenth,'' was written by <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> and has been performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. However, its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> debut at the Schiller Theater marks the first time <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> has delivered his lines in German. <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, who turned 67 on April 16, admits that speaking German is his biggest challenge in the performance. `` For me, every night at the <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> is a premiere,'' he said in a recent interview. `` German is a difficult language. It forces me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that I'm not used too; I'm constantly in danger of getting stuck.'' For the interview, <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> made his remarks in nearly fluent but cautiously enunciated German. The play opened in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in January and has been sold out ever since. More than 40,000 people are expected to see the production before its scheduled April 30 closing, <PERSON> Gisela </PERSON> <PERSON> Huwe </PERSON>, a theater spokeswoman, said. `` ` <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Tenth' is one of the greatest successes in the 40-year history of the <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Huwe </PERSON> said of the two-act play written by <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>. Much of the play's action concentrates on efforts by a fictional <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> music critic named <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> to imagine how <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s 10th Symphony might have sounded It also focuses on his often stormy relations with his son, <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>, who composes modern symphonies which Winter has no use for. A Viennese au-pair girl named <PERSON> Irmgard </PERSON>, who loves <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>, manages to wake the composer from the dead. The composer rings the doorbell and strides, with long hair flowing, across the stage. With the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor, the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first time. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s last completed symphony is his ninth _ The Choral. Music researchers, however, say they have discovered sketches for an unfinished symphony, possibly a 10th, dated after completion of his Ninth Symphony and before his death in 1827. In <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>'s play, the audience never learns how the 10th Symphony really sounded, but the resurrected genius helps bring the feuding Winter family closer together. Critics say <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>'s often deliberate German delivery adds to the performance, increasing audience empathy to the character of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave. <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> said he especially enjoys playing on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> stage. `` The actor is in direct contact with the audience here,'' he said. `` The people are very warmhearted.'' <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> is internationally known for his versatility as a stage and screen actor, and in recent years has become best known for his portrayal of <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s Belgian sleuth <PERSON> Hercule </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirot </PERSON>. He has written several other plays, a collection of short stories and a novel. In film, he gained prominence for his portrayal of <PERSON> Nero </PERSON> in <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>'s 1951 <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> epic, `` Quo Vadis.'' He is also known as the voice of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> the Elephant, a popular children's book character created by the late French author <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Diego Rivera Mural in Post-Quake Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There once was a time when people could sit in the bar of the old Hotel <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> and enjoy looking at <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s mural, `` Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.'' The once elegant hotel is now an earthquake-damaged hulk waiting to be demolished, and the mural is in its own museum pavilion across the street. The delicate transfer of the mural has been completed. It escaped damage in the Sept. 19, 1985, earthquake that killed thousands and devastated large parts of the city. The famous mural is open to the public again, like a window opened on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s rich history. It shows figures from the Mexican political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the park. An explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the extent of the damage there became clear. `` It should be linked to the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, for having been painted on that theme and for the place itself,'' the plaque from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says. The <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, the downtown park across the street and down a block from the mural's old home, also was expanded through earthquake reconstruction programs. A `` Solidarity Garden'' recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of the cleared, adjoining block that once held a department store and the Hotel Regis. The mural's pavilion is built on the site of the hotel's parking garage, which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake. The <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that no room could be found in any of its buildings close to the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, `` because of the colossal dimensions of the work. ... That's why it was decided to take advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate building.'' In place of the old hotel's comfortable cocktail lounge, viewers now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room. Diagrams, with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure, tell who 73 of the people shown in the mural are. Among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face, a self-portrait _ something <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> often put in his works. In the foreground is Spanish conqueror <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>. On a park bench an elderly man dreams of President <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, giving American Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> the keys to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and other lands that once belonged to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Farther back, a former military man, now poor, dreams of the emperors <PERSON> Maximilian </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Carlota </LOCATION>. A drunken tramp, next to an old woman, dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories, at the side of <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>, who holds the reform laws he put into effect as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s great 19th century president. Near the center is dictator <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> appears full of his fame and power, with a chest full of ribbons on his uniform. At the right, a street vendor offers typical Mexican food to a middle-class youth and three students, who dream of Gen. <PERSON> Victoriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>. Official history says <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> had <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madero </PERSON>, who started the 1910-21 Mexican revolution, killed. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> completed the 49 -LCB- foot by 13 foot painting for the then fashionable <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> in 1948. Along with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Siqueiros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Orozco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> was one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s three great muralists and one of the most important Latin American painters in the art world. He died in 1957. Among his other best known murals are those in the National Palace of the Spanish conquest, the Mexican revolution and other events from the country's history. `` The composition is memories of my life, of my childhood and my youth, from 1895 to 1910,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> wrote after finishing the mural. `` I do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone. The contemporary figures in the fresco, as figures in dreams, are not portraits.'' It was an apparent reference to the phrase, `` God Does Not Exist,'' a quote attributed to Juarez adviser <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and written on a piece of paper by <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> in the mural. Eight years after the mural was completed, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> changed the paper to read, `` Conference in the Academy of <LOCATION> Letran </LOCATION>, the year 1836.'' The phrase refers to the date and place where <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> made his controversial comment.

<TEXT>
 A belter, says singer <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, is one who gives his or her all. `` You're afraid you might hyperventilate or crack, but you do it for the excitement of it,'' the Tony award-winning performer said. `` Head singers have to hold everything tight to get the note. I like belters, people who have that noncontrol but control.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is also an Emmy winner who spent six seasons delighting TV audiences on the sitcom `` Gim me a Break.'' She was interviewed while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a nine-day engagement at the Village Gate. `` I have a Las Vegas show,'' she said. `` One critic said on a scale of one to 10 we were 11. I'm not doing that show.'' The dinner show in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, she said, is easy. `` They like anything as long as it's recognizable. You get a chance to really wail a song, do something with a great arrangement. The late show, you have a lot of drunks. You sing whatever they want to hear. Torch songs seem to go over.'' She's choosing from among 60 songs in her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> show, which opened April 15. `` I wanted to sing <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> this time and some country songs and I'm learning ` One of Us Was Wrong' from 1899 and some <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> songs. If you were to put this show on canvas, it would be very abstract.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> won a Tony for best featured actress in a musical for her performance in `` Ai n't Misbehavin','' the revue of Fats <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> songs which opened on Broadway in 1978, and she will be in the revival this August. She sings <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>'s `` Keepin' Out of Mischief Now'' in her show. She left `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' after nine months to have her tonsils out, sang <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> at the King Cole Room of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, was in `` Black Broadway'' at <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and then returned to `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to fulfill her contract. `` They've always cast the part to look like me,'' she said. `` People will say they saw me in St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>.'' In those days, and until about four years ago, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said she did not appreciate her talent. `` I was hanging out with the wrong crowd, participating in things I would n't choose to do now,'' she said. `` Now when I'm on stage I know why they're applauding. I know what I just said. I remember what I did last night. `` I'm not saying I was a loose woman. I did have my episode with drugs. `` I was able to have a good career while I was doing terrible things to myself. I do n't see why I did not die. I think it must have been a death wish for me to even be involved in the things I was doing. Thank God I did n't die. Now I do n't want to. It's a different world for me now.'' Growing up in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> listened to her mother's recordings of Dinah <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and B.B King, and her brother's <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> records She liked <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, the Andrews Sisters, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, and mentions <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Barbra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Streisand </LOCATION> as singers she admires. `` If <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> wants to sing with me, I wo n't turn her down _ I'll give the poor kid a break,'' she said. `` I would love to sing with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>. His soul is so bare.'' However, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> would like to have been an opera singer. `` When I was growing up, it was not something you aspired to. I was a weirdo to want to be in show business. Most kids wanted to be teachers or nurses.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has a daughter from a previous union and has been married for six years. `` I'm not going to tell you anything about him,'' she said. `` He is a very private person, a very nice man. His family does not understand publicity. They do n't like it.'' She collects crystal and antique silver picture frames and is an avid reader, favoring biographies and history. She hopes to work with the producers of `` Gim me a Break'' again and wants to get back on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Lagging Utilities Worry Market Analysts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many analysts who are still skittish about the investment outlook these days point to the uninspired behavior lately of utility stocks. Last week, while the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials briefly touched a new high since the October crash, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>'s average of 15 utilities lagged behind. When it dipped below 170 late last week, the utility average stood more than 10 percent below where it was on Jan. 29. The performance of utility stocks as a group is `` a good gauge of the interest-rate environment,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the firm's weekly advisory publication The Outlook. It is also, he added, `` often a leading indicator of stock prices in general.'' Utility stocks tend to respond quickly to changing expectations about the interest-rate outlook for a couple of well-known reasons. For one thing, since utilities are heavy borrowers to finance their capital needs, interest rates are an important element of their costs of doing business. Besides that, most investors in utility stocks are very yield-conscious, and thus tend to push the stocks' prices up and down in close alignment with fluctuations in the bond market. In the great bull market, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> utility average was the first of the widely recognized indicators to peak out, at 227.83 on Jan. 22, 1987. Any investors who used that as a `` sell signal'' missed out on the dramatic gains in industrial stock prices that continued through August of last year. But they also would have been safely out of the way when interest rates surged upward last spring, and when stock prices crashed in the fall. The recent weakness in utilities, <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> says, `` is reason for concern, as it suggests that investors believe interest rates are headed higher.'' Of course, interest-rate expectations can change, sometimes very quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> maintains that `` utility stocks generally appear to be oversold. We think they could do better in the months ahead.'' Even if utilities do not come on strong, argues <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, they are not an infallible guide to what the rest of the market might do. Utilities fell in 1977, he points out, and then industrial stocks rose for the next three years. `` The poor performance of the utility averages signals bad problems for the overall stock market to many investors, especially since the divergence developed prior to the crash of last year,'' he said. `` They're waiting for another shoe to fall. I think it's a mistake to look for a matching shoe. `` To mix metaphors a little, I would point out that the same lightning rarely strikes the stock market twice in a row.'' In <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s view, the market's early-1988 rally drew its force not from value considerations based on such things as interest rates, but rather from strong corporate earnings. `` Utilities wo n't work, but not because another crisis is in the making,'' he said. `` They wo n't work because this is n't a valuation-driven market anymore. `` The bottom in interest rates is very well established now. As a result, the industrial averages, the utility averages and interest rates are no longer going to move together. `` This is a more advanced stage of the stock market cycle. And I do n't know of any reliable tool to predict its duration.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and raise taxes on the rich. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would shoot down the Midgetman missile and hire more tax collectors. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would consider a tax on luxuries, but supports some weapons his rivals oppose. The budget and defense policy are not the only areas in which the three surviving challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination differ. Among the others: abortion, education, taxes and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, particularly, has been a topic of considerable concern as the candidates head into Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. In 1984, Jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the civil rights activist, has taken the most consistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues, and has offered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, also has embraced many liberal social ideas, including universal health insurance, but has suggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forging partnerships with the private sector. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has staked out the more conservative stances on military and foreign policy issues, and has been the most outspoken supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and opponent of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. He has gained expertise on arms control during 12 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where he has compiled a liberal voting record on labor, environment and health issues. Here is a look at where the Democrats stand on key issues:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would make the wealthiest 600,000 taxpayers pay at a rate of 38.5 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33 percent. He also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, `` No serious candidate for president can rule out the possibility of new taxes.'' But he says the first step is to hire more <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and `` collect every dollar we can of that $ 110 billion that's not being paid today.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for those making more than $ 200,000 a year. `` If we are driven as a last resort to new taxes, I will fight to ensure that we turn first to those who can afford it,'' says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has suggested raising nearly $ 1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items, $ 10 billion by keeping corporate taxes at their current level and $ 5 billion by taxing the sale of inherited stocks on the basis of their original value. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supports an oil import fee; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has not ruled one out. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a vociferous opponent of such a tariff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUDGET DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> claims he could reduce the deficit by $ 100 billion annually by 1993 by freezing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for five years and by his tax increases on the wealthy. But he has also proposed major increases in social spending. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would scale back Star Wars research and save $ 50 billion by scrapping the Midgetman missile. He says he would trim federal programs and squeeze out waste, but cautions, `` We're not going to get major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget. It's been savaged over the past seven years.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> says he would `` convene a summit of our nation's leaders on economics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle our budget deficit.'' He proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail, cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating `` the $ 40 billion of unnecessary medical diagnostics'' that the government pays for each year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 All three candidates oppose the Strategic Defense Initiative. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would scale back basic research in the field to pre-Star Wars levels. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> proposes saving $ 40 billion by not building two new aircraft carrier task forces, and `` tens of billions of dollars'' by negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets. He opposes building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber, the Trident D-5 missile, or any more MX missiles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the Midgetman. He contends that until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces, savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> non-nuclear forces. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a stalwart supporter of the single-warhead Midgetman missile, and helped win congressional approval for it in exchange for limiting production of the multi-warhead MX missile to 50. Like his rivals, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> opposed military aid to the Contras, but has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> fought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to revive the B-1 bomber, then voted to limit production to 100.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> does not support creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has refused to rule it out. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supports an independent homeland for Palestians. All three say the Arab nations must recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who once met with <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, now says he would not do it again. But he calls current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy `` fatally flawed'' and favors `` an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> involving all the parties concerned, including the chosen representatives of the Palestinian people.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders' refusal to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to blame for the current Palestinian strife; he says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> refused to join 30 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in sending a letter of protest to the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> government on its handling of the unrest; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would have signed the letter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fully support women's legal right to abortion and federal funding for abortions. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> opposes a constitutional ban on abortions, but has voted to limit federal tax dollars for abortions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would double the $ 21 billion <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> budget and expand Head Start and other programs so that all disadvantaged children could take part. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed scholarships to attract more students into teaching, and new tax breaks for families to save for college. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has called for more federal support for schools and Head Start, but also suggested a longer school year and that teachers be more accountable.

 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> promises a national health care program covering all Americans `` no matter what their income.'' It would cover nursing home costs and be funded `` by earmarked health taxes and general revenues.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has promised to make universal health insurance a basic right, but proposes to do it without `` creating a big new bureaucratic program'' or spending `` a dime'' by requiring most employers to offer health insurance as a fringe benefit. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has just become the first state to move in that direction, and similar legislation is already pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plan, which exempts firms with five or fewer employees, will cost that state $ 550 million or more through 1992. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has been instrumental in legislation creating an organ transplant network and tougher regulation of companies that make infant formula. He says, `` We must provide compassionate, affordable health care so that hospital costs are not driven to unbearable levels by the need to care for individuals who can not pay.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WELFARE, JOBS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises an overhaul of welfare programs along the lines of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' successful effort to place welfare recipients in jobs. Both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> support raising the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage and to require future raises to keep pace with inflation. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has called for a national minimum welfare benefit, with two-parent families eligible. States are now free to set their own Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits, and to bar payments to intact families. All three Democrats have vowed to step up federal efforts to stop drugs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he would boost the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget on drug enforcement, prevention and treatment from $ 3.9 billion to $ 6.7 billion.

<TEXT>
 Six months after the stock market crash of 1987, a sense of shock and confusion still pervades Wall Street. Although stock prices have recovered some of their losses of Black Monday Oct. 19, the crash weighs heavily on just about any financial decision or economic forecast these days. Despite the economy's resilience, the $ 500 billion collapse has severely dampened the enthusiasm of both professional money managers and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public for stock investments. And its aftershocks remain very much in evidence, as they were Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average dropped 101.46 points in response to a government report showing an unexpected widening of the nation's trade deficit. Trading volume in all the major stock markets so far in 1988 is running behind the pace it set a year ago. Through early April, volume was down 4.1 percent at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and 16.7 percent in the over-the-counter market. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> decline would be much bigger were it not for heavy trading in stocks of companies targeted for takeovers and high-yielding issues with impending dividend payments. Veteran observers caution that it will take still more time to assess the crash's ultimate effects. Even with the advantage of hindsight, it is clear that the crash was many different things to many different people. At one extreme, some analysts will tell you Black Monday was just the first stage of a severe bear market that will usher in a recession _ or worse _ in the nation's economy. At the other, some insist it was nothing more than an exaggerated `` correction'' that drove excessive enthusiasm out of the marketplace, setting the stage for new rallies in stock prices and helping to prevent a recession that might otherwise be in progress today. While there is n't yet, and may never be, a widely accepted consensus on what precisely caused the crash, a good many analysts have come to agree that it stemmed in large measure from a change in the credit policies of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and central banks of other prominent industrialized countries. In this view, these powerful institutions created a financial boom in the mid-1980s by fostering the growth of a vast pool of `` liquidity,'' or money looking for a place to go to work. Starting in early 1987, they began to shut off the flow, prompted by fears of inflation and a long decline in the value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies. Economist <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojnilower </PERSON>, a managing director at the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent appraisal: `` As 1987 wore on, it became more and more evident _ so that ultimately even the stock markets had to accept the fact _ that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy was on a course leading to an eventual recession.'' That recession did n't arrive on schedule, <PERSON> Wojnilower </PERSON> added, because restrictive monetary policies were immediately abandoned in the aftermath of the crash. He says a business slump is still in the offing, probably in 1989, `` but it need not be severe. The end of the world is not at hand.'' With all the studies, investigations and reports by blue-ribbon panels that have been done since the crash, major steps to reform and fortify the markets have come slowly or not at all. The presidential commission headed by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> promoted the idea that the nation's financial markets _ the stock market and the futures market where contracts on stock indexes are traded _ could be set up and managed as `` one market.'' The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan called for coordinating the regulation of the markets and installing `` circuit breakers'' that would prevent a crisis from erupting in one market and spreading to the other. Those who blame computer-driven program trading for contributing to the October debacle point out that such techniques are triggered by discrepancies in the prices of stock index futures and the underlying equities. But the two markets have long operated under significantly different rules and have resisted regulatory changes that might threaten their franchises. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s super-regulatory proposal has been bogged down by haggling over who would be the super regulator. Although the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel favored the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank appears reluctant to take on the job. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is more willing to fill the void, but regulators of the futures markets have resisted the idea of turning over a measure of their authority to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. To help sort out the competing interests, the White House has appointed yet another committee, comprised of representatives of the various regulatory agencies, which is expected to report still more recommendations later this spring. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has adopted one notable new rule _ a constraint known as a `` collar'' that bars use of its main order-processing system for one method of program trading should the Dow Jones industrial average rise or fall on any given day by as much as 50 points. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> has announced a sharp increase in the amount of capital that must be held by its specialists, the brokers who act as meeting points for buy and sell orders on the trading floor. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> has moved to try to strengthen the over-the-counter market for unlisted stocks, which it oversees. By summer, <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> procedures are scheduled to be in effect to decrease the market's dependency on voice communication by telephone, and to punish dealers who back away from fast-moving markets without a special-case excuse. The aim of such measures is to increase the markets' strength and accessibility in times of stress, so that the machinery does n't break down altogether and turn an already bad situation into a disaster Still, many regulators and securities industry officials say it would be pointless and quite possibly dangerous to attempt to legislate away the threat of any future crashes. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> were standing by with its enormous resources as a buyer of last resort in times of crisis, presumably the stock market would be less susceptible, if not immune, to panics. But something like that would also cost the market what <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, calls `` the discipline of risk.'' If investors believed they could rely indefinitely on an institution like the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to support the market, they might well go on a speculative binge that would create stresses not even the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could deal with. Under this line of reasoning, the quickest way to set the stage for the next market crash would be to create a system to assure everybody that it could never happen again.

 In what was billed as the series ender, `` Magnum, P.I.'' concluded last season with our hero getting gunned down and walking off into an ethereal landscape that looked suspiciously like heaven. But star <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> agreed to do 13 more episodes, and <PERSON> Magnum </PERSON>'s walk through the clouds was explained as an out-of-body experience On Sunday, `` Magnum'' ends its eight-year run on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> with a special two-hour episode. This time, there will be no catch, no reincarnation, no next season. `` After this episode, the audience would have a very hard time figuring out how we could ever do a reunion show,'' said <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> on a break in filming. `` There's a finality to this show. We wanted to do something that would threaten the franchise.'' <PERSON> Chas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the show's co-executive producer, would n't give away the ending, but did say the finale will answer some questions `` It will touch on the issue of whether <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> is really <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>. It will deal with every one of the characters in at least looking at what their lives will be like after ` Magnum,''' he said. <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnum </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer turned private eye, perpetually on the brink of poverty but living in high style, thanks to the largesse of never-seen wealthy mystery writer <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillerman </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the British major domo who runs Masters' estate and antagonizes Magnum, even as he comes to his aid. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manetti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> are Magnum's <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> buddies, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and T.C Set against the exotic backdrop of the islands, `` Magnum, P.I.'' plots ran from silly to deadly serious. The show made <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> an international star. In its early years, the CBS series consistently landed in the top 10 of the Nielsen ratings. But in 1984, it was scheduled against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' and its ratings sagged. After some juggling by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Magnum'' moved to Wednesday night and regained much of its audience. `` It's important to me that we go out while people still want us,'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> said. `` This show is too special to me to let it die a natural death. No matter what the rest of my films did, or even the success of ` Three Men and a Baby,' it all came to me by way of this show, and I've always tried to take care of ` Magnum.''' `` Three Men and a Baby'' marked <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s first major screen success after several starring roles. <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s reputation as an actor was initially overshadowed by his image as a pin-up. But he eventually won an Emmy award as best actor in a dramatic series. Working in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, he said, protected him from the buffeting of sudden fame. `` I've been lucky over here, I've been sheltered from a lot of the stuff tht goes on on the mainland,'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> said. `` It's great to be chosen favorite this or that, but a whole lot of baggage goes with all those titles. And then what happens when you're not at the top of the opinion polls? That's why, even though I appreciate it, I try not to buy into that stuff and being in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has just made that easier. Plus, I love it here.'' He said he will maintain his ties to the islands. He has formed a production company with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and `` Magnum'' supervising producer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> and hopes to produce a new series here, though without <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> as star. <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s dual role of producing and starring in `` Magnum'' the past two years resulting in an `` unnatural existence,'' he said. `` It just takes up too large a part of my life _ which is all my waking hours _ and in the long run I just do n't think that's very healthy, physically or emotionally,'' said <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, who last year married actress <PERSON> Jillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. He planned to begin working in July on `` Her Alibi,'' a romantic comedy directed by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>. Until then, he said, he'll relax `` I asked for the time off because I just do n't know how I'm gon na feel after Magnum ends,'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> said `` I think I really need to take the time off to just see what happens. That's why I really have very few kinds of goals or direction right now.'' Saying goodbye wo n't be easy, <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> said. `` There's a huge part of me that would love ` Magnum' to go on forever,'' he said. `` I really do believe that it'll be about the best job I'll ever have.''

 The government's report that the monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened by more than 11 percent to $ 13.8 billion in February sparked a nosedive in stock prices and the dollar. The gap between the nation's imports and exports expanded by $ 1.4 billion from January's imbalance of $ 12.4 billion _ its second straight jump after having fallen from a record $ 17.6 billion deficit last October, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday.

 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped after the government announced a higher-than-expected trade deficit in February. The Dow skidded 101.46 points to 2,005.64, a 4.8 percent decline, making Thursday's plunge the year's second worst drop after a 140.58-point slide on Jan. 8. Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between imports and exports would be less than $ 12 billion, and were disappointed at the actual results.

Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> said he had met privately with some of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s biggest stockholders, and that bank officials would continue soliciting others via telephone and mail until <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s annual meeting next Thursday `` It's a unique fit,'' <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at their yearly gathering Thursday. `` Virtually all their businesses blend well into our's. We believe no other merger could make as much sense ...'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 of its common shares for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s roughly 18.1 million common shares outstanding, a proposal <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has rejected as inadequate during their extended and bitter takeover fight. At <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> said preliminary tabulations showed shareholders solidly backed the company by granting it permission to issue as many additional common shares and convertible securities as needed to complete the Irving acquisition. The exact result of the vote on the stock question is to be released April 22. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is seeking to gain control of that company's board of directors and has nominated a slate of 16 nominees. Analysts said they could not predict whether <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> could succeed. `` I ca n't take bets on that one ... though I'm sure <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is feeling very bullish'' following Thursday's meeting, said <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that's a very close call,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think they -LRB- Irving shareholders -RRB- may be persuaded, but it's a coin flip almost.'' Many analysts agree that a combination of the two would not be such a bad idea because both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks operate in a similar marketplace and offer similar services such as securities processing. But <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> repeatedly has spurned the company's takeover offers, which began about seven months ago, maintaining it wants to remain independent. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> representatives had urged <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shareholders Thursday to ask management to abandon all efforts to merge the two banks. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> argued that combining the two would dilute the value of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> stock, hurting earnings and dividends. `` We are convinced that the cost of integrating the two companies would create a further drain on earnings and that any benefits of combining the two firms would not be recognized for three to five years,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Falise </PERSON>, an executive vice president for legal affairs at <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> maintained dilution was not a problem. He also said a takeover would not reduce <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s dividends, which have increased annually for the past 11 years. Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began its current tender offer last month after receiving regulatory approval. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said a merger would n't hurt competition in the nation's biggest financial center <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has asked the federal courts to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has taken a number of other steps to tryto defeat Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s advances, including instituting an anti-takeover `` poison pill'' defense that is designed to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive. Hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking industry. A merger between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> would create one of the nation's 15 largest bank holding companies with combined assets of more than $ 40 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> began its takeover efforts six months ago with an offer of $ 1.4 billion, or $ 80 in cash and securities. It revised the offer to $ 68 in cash and securities following October's stock market crash, and lowered the bid a second time in late January.

 Investors remain cautious about the nation's economic outlook today after a report of a rising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap knocked them for a loop and sparked a $ 100 billion selloff on Wall Street The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Thursday that the trade deficit rose to $ 13.8 billion in February sparked a 101.46-point decline to 2,005.64 in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks. In foreign exchange, the dollar fell about 2 percent against the Japanese yen and West German mark despite central bank purchases aimed at bolstering the dollar, and bond market interest rates rose to their highest levels since January. The trade report raised concerns that the dollar would remain under pressure despite a months-old agreement by major industrialized nations to support it. That agreement was reaffirmed Wednesday by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Investors worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might try to support the falling currency by pushing interest rates higher. On Wall Street, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones nearly 11 to 1 in the worst day since the widely-followed Dow Jones average fell 140.58 points on Jan. 8. The Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation that February's trade news would be favorable. The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks fell by $ 99.7 billion in Thursday's plunge, according to a 5,000-stock index measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> In the bond market, the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond jumped to roughly 8.86 percent Thursday, the highest since January, from 8.73 percent late Wednesday The trade report also battered major foreign markets. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent on Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, stocks fell sharply at today's opening but later recovered much of their losses. The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, down more than 250 points at one time, finished the morning session at 26,967.83, down 143.52 from Thursday's record close. The dollar opened a sharp 1.7 percent lower against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> but later stabilized on reports of heavy dollar-buying by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. Some economists called the markets' fears an overreaction. `` The quality -LRB- precision -RRB- of the numbers obviously leaves something to be desired,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The trade report indicated consumers were continuing to spend strongly, sucking up imports, <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON> said. The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $ 17.6 billion in October. It was up from January's $ 12.4 billion gap, but was down from a deficit of $ 14.4 billion in February 1987. `` It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial markets interesting.

 Rebuilding confidence in the stock market after the crash last October is proving to be an elusive and time-consuming mission. The market's latest bid to rally collapsed on Thursday when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the best known measure of market trends, fell 101.46 points to 2,005.64, for its fifth-largest loss ever. From April 5 through Tuesday of this week, the Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points, largely on anticipation of a continuing flow of favorable news on the nation's trade balance and the outlook for the dollar in foreign exchange. But the word from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday morning was that the trade deficit widened in February, with imports exceeding exports by $ 13.83 against $ 12.44 billion the month before. In effect, that wiped out with a single stroke the basic premise behind the recent rally. Stock market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in particular, raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> soon might feel the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to support the dollar. `` You got a nasty bit of news,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market is saying that the economy is too strong.'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> also said the withdrawal from the market since last fall of many investors frightened away by the crash had left stocks in a fragile position, vulnerable to volatile swings. `` It's really a day-trader's market,'' he said. `` When we were rallying, there was n't a lot of volume. `` And when the market started to come down, there were no buffers on the downside _ no small investors, no pension managers, no foreign investors.'' That leaves Wall Street in a paradoxical plight. Investors large and small seem inclined to stay clear of the stock market until it shows signs of greater stability. But it looks as though those investors' presence may be needed if that stability is going to be attained. In the meantime, market analysts and professional money managers still are groping for some indication of where the market ought to settle out, and of what level of stock prices `` makes sense'' in the aftermath of the crash. As <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnaruma </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, put it in his latest market commentary: `` In the current environment, all the normal road signs that usually provide one with direction appear to have been stolen by vandals.''

<HEAD>Dow Drop Tests 50-Point Collar, Revives Debate Over Program
Trading Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first major test of Wall Street's computerized trading `` collar'' in braking a big fall in stock prices is getting mixed reviews, with some calling the limit helpful and others saying it may have worsened the drop `` The collar has got some holes in it,'' <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> strategist, said Thursday after the Dow Jones average tumbled 101.46 points, its fifth-worst daily decline ever. The slide represented more than double the 50-point swing necessary to activate the collar, which when triggered bans the use of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> computers for so-called index arbitrage program trading for the rest of the day. The drop marked the first time since the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> imposed the restriction on Feb. 4 that a decline activated the 50-point trigger. The collar took effect once before on April 6 when the average rose 64.16 points. `` At the present time, it's not working,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, head of retail equities at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said as selling swept the market even once the collar took effect at about 1:55 p.m. EDT. The limit is part of an <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> effort to restore stability to a market still suffering after-effects of the epic crash nearly six months ago. Some crash studies have suggested program trading aggravated the October plunge, and the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has expressed concern that the practice is undermining investor and regulator confidence. `` It's really premature to assess whether the collar works,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON>. `` It was n't designed to stop the Dow average from moving. We only have evidence of two days. When we get more data, we'll analyze it. If it's necessary to take further action, we might.'' Some traders said they believed the collar lessened the impact of what would have been a heavy selloff under any circumstances. Investors rushed to dump stocks largely because of economic worries linked to the government's report of a wider-than-expected trade deficit for February. But others said the braking effects of the collar were overwhelmed by big brokerage houses that executed sell orders manually or used forms of program trading not covered by the restraint. A few traders said they believed the collar actually worsened the drop because it only left sellers in the market. `` Once this thing goes below 50, nobody shows up to do any buying,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, a technical strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In index arbitrage, brokers use computers to buy or sell massive amounts of stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the equivalent stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, in order to profit from price disparities. Although many brokerages have applauded the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s limit on the technique, others have been critical because they say it severs an important relationship between the stock and futures markets. Studies of the stock crash have concluded the relationship between financial markets was an important element in the October crash. A presidential panel's crash study, for example, suggested that a system of `` circuit breakers'' applying simultaneously to all markets trading stocks or stock-index futures would help prevent another crisis. `` I have a couple of problems with the whole collar concept,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a futures-market expert and securities lawyer who is critical of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s post-crash strategy. `` Clearly, you ca n't disconnect the stock exchange from the futures market. They're all one big ball of wax,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` If you have only the stock exchange with a circuit breaker, it does n't do a damn thing.''

 A new kind of corn bread that combines down-home color and flavor with a firmness that stands up to slicing could help shrink the nation's corn surplus if it goes over well with consumers, government researchers say. This is not old-fashioned corn bread that crumbles into the ham and beans. This firm new loaf _ made from flour that's half wheat and half finely ground corn _ can be sliced, buttered, toasted and used for sandwiches. `` It gives people a new bread product, and it could enable farmers to sell more of their corn at a higher price,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> food technologist <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. The bread was developed at the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said the goal was to develop a bread that used as much corn flour as possible `` so it would make a big impact on using up surplus corn supplies.'' As it turned out, the ideal flour formulation was half corn and half wheat, with extra wheat gluten to improve its structure. The dough is leavened with yeast. Traditional corn bread is made mainly from coarser cornmeal and baking powder. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said the new corn bread resembles a home-baked or specialty bakery loaf rather than typical supermarket sandwich bread. But she said wholesale bakers could modify the formula `` to make it lighter and fluffier'' if that is the kind of loaf their customers want. `` The next step is to encourage industry to try this and find a market for it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. The $ 16 billion-a-year wholesale bread - and cake-baking industry uses about 100 million pounds of flour annually, according to <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, editor of the Milling and Baking News `` I ca n't even predict what consumer interest would be'' for the new corn bread, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baking </ORGANIZATION>. `` I like corn bread, so if it has that flavor it might appeal to some of the public.'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> noted that sales of a new product usually reflect the amount of money spent on marketing and advertising. Bakers would have to believe the new corn bread is `` delightfully good tasting'' to make a major investment in promoting it, he said. During the 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> Purity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> marketed a product called Country Corn Bread, using a smaller percentage of corn flour. President <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said that version had a rich golden color, and because corn flour holds moisture well it also stayed fresh longer. `` It is just one of those items that was very successful at the time, but tastes change and it eventually was replaced,'' said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. `` People today are searching for new varieties'' and this could be a good time to offer a new kind of corn bread, he said. A popular new corn bread also could help the nation's dry millers, who use about 2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faga </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The industry certainly is looking for new uses for dry milled corn _ every possible outlet,'' said <PERSON> Faga </PERSON>. `` This certainly could be a new one for them.''

<HEAD>Shareholders Stall De Bendetti's Bid For Societe Generale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have dealt <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> a setback in his attempted takeover of the giant holding company, but the Italian financier still wields some clout over the enterprise. At a 12-hour special shareholders meeting on Thursday, shareholders spurned the bid by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and two allies to win seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. The trio got votes from only 44.5 percent of the shares registered, and needed 51 percent to win election to the board. But because he commands a huge block of shares, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> retains much clout within the company and may win yet a board seat. `` Today's votes will not be for the long term,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> told the more than 1,150 shareholders before the vote, which was taken at a meeting held in a tent next to <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s head office. `` In one week, one month, six months or one year, we will play a major role in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. Without me ... no stable management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> is possible.'' Management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest holding company, was relieved after the marathon meeting. `` We fought it out. There was a winner and a loser,'' said Director <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON>. Shareholders added 12 members _ all rivals of <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benedetti </LOCATION> _ to the board of directors with a majority of 55 percent of the vote. The previous board had 11 directors. Right up through the start of the meeting, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> had met with his rivals to seek a compromise. But the talks failed when <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> continued insisting on control over day-to-day management of the venerable, 166-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which has stakes in some 1,300 companies worldwide. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, who sparked the heated takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> three months ago, had sought election along with two allies, including <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> nominated the remaining 12 candidates, allies of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. The two companies, heading an alliance of smaller Belgian, French, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and Swiss interests, led the fight against <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. The vote indicated how many shares each faction controls. Under Belgian law, shareholders are not required to disclose the amount of their holdings, leaving only speculation over which group holds a majority. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, who spent some $ 1.7 billion to raise his <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> holdings, claims he and his allies control 48 percent of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> say they hold 50.7 percent, after spending about $ 850 million to beef up their stake. At Thursday's meeting, a <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION> aide made an official statement complaining about `` irregularities'' in the voting, including extensive delays in tallying the vote caused by computer malfunctions. Analysts said the protest may have been made to allow <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> to protest the vote in court, although there were no immediate threats of legal action. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> also is fighting a legal battle over <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s issuance of 12 million new shares in an attempt to dilute his stake. The stock was issued Jan. 18, the day <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> launched his hostile bid. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, the chairman of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, wants to turn <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> _ which has interests in mining, engineering, manufacturing, chemicals, banking, and other areas _ into a pan-European holding company before 1992. That year, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is to remove regulatory curbs on the free movement of goods and services.

<HEAD>Federal Inquiry Will Examine Texas Air's Complex Financial
Structure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The squad of federal investigators probing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> faces the task of unraveling a labyrinthine corporate structure adopted by the nation's biggest airline company. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday charged 25 accountants, auditors, economists and financial analysts with delving into a complex structure that has steeped the ailing carrier in controversy and made it the target of labor union hostility. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which commands 20 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, is the parent company of major carriers <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. A key figure in the government's probe will be <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> who aggressively built the company from a small intrastate carrier into an airline empire. Unions and other critics have accused <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of siphoning off <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> assets into the parent company. Recent Texas Air filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> indicated that both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> `` are under substantial, increasing financial pressure,'' <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said in announcing the investigation. Documents indicate, for example, that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s cash reserves were drained last year at a rate of more than $ 1 million a day, and that the company has around $ 7 billion in liabilities related to leasing planes. The government's financial probe will examine the corporation's management and business practices and the relationships between the parent, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, said DOT General Counsel <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> The department's deputy general counsel, <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, will head the investigation. While <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> controls <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> itself is the parent of other Lorenzo acquisitions: <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. All three have ceased operating _ Frontier is in bankruptcy _ but <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has absorbed their assets. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also operates several commuter carriers: <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Britt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Provincetown-Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Together, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> carriers have a huge debt of around $ 5.4 billion, but <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has set up a corporate structure that insulates the parent itself from most of the burden. The parent company sustained record losses of $ 466 million last year. The Wall Street Journal recently likened the complex corporate architecture to a house of many rooms: Every room has a paying tenant and a bank can foreclose on an individual room, but not on the whole house. The landlord has many partners, but no one can challenge his management of the property. The setup allows cash to move upstream from loss-making <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> units to the parent _ in the form of management fees, rents on planes and airport gates, commissions on fuel purchases and others. In its order for an investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> said a number of financial transactions between the parent and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> `` raise questions concerning whether substantial funds and other resources are being diverted from the air carrier subsidiaries.'' The department questioned, for example: _ <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> shifting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable computer reservation system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note `` which may be less than the system's fair market value. _ Eastern paying `` substantial fees'' for management services, fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company _ Eastern accepting a no-interest note, instead of cash, for $ 16 million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> borrowing $ 25 million from Eastern in March 1987 in exchange for an unsecured note at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was having cash flow problems <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> recently proposed to spin off <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle service in exchange for an infusion of $ 225 million in cash and securities for the strapped airline, but that attempt has been blocked by federal courts. While the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> looks into the financial condition of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is undertaking a stringent safety investigation of Miami-based Eastern. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday fined Eastern $ 823,000 because of `` recurring trends'' of violations of safety regulations, and on Thursday temporarily grounded five Eastern planes for minor safety violations.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wants you to have a nice vacation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. So the luxury automaker is offering free plane tickets on one condition: that the trip include the purchase of a Mercedes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Since March 30, Mercedes has been giving two round-trip economy plane tickets, or one business-class ticket, on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> flights to customers who purchase and pick up autos from its factory near <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. As under most European pick-up programs, the company pays for shipment of the car back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and for a 2.5 percent import duty. The net savings, according to spokesman A.B. <PERSON> Schuman </PERSON> at Mercedes' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, is about 8 percent off the retail price. <PERSON> Schuman </PERSON> said the free offer caters to overseas buyers who frequently combine a European tour with their auto purchase, which in turn saves the cost of renting an automobile. European delivery has been part of luxury-car marketing since the early 1960s, <PERSON> Schuman </PERSON> said, and Mercedes' current gimmick is part of a long-term marketing strategy. Mercedes sold 2,090 cars to Americans in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year, out of a total 89,900 purchased for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In an increasingly competitive luxury car market, Mercedes' ticket offer has more to do with gaining a competitive edge than with boosting European delivery sales, said spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGurn </PERSON> at rival BMW of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION> <PERSON> Schuman </PERSON> said it was too early to tell the results of the Mercedes' program, but a sales manager at the nation's largest Mercedes dealership said he was pleased. `` It's done the job here,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> at Downtown <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Four buyers lured by the ticket offer made deals on Wednesday and one called last weekend, when advertisements for the program began appearing, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The ticket offer is one example of how luxury car makers are competing for buyers, who have become reluctant because of confusion over the new tax laws that went into effect in 1987, the October stock market crash and the continuing decline of the dollar, which has boosted foreign car prices, said <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McGurn </PERSON>. BMW, for instance, has boosted its advertising and is offering a lower percentage financing on leasing rates. Of 87,800 domestic sales, 1,610 BMWs were picked up in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McGurn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, reported 741 European deliveries for 1987 from four European locations, said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventrilio </PERSON>.

 The hard rain that fell on <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ceremonies honoring <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> pioneer <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been practically the only thing to dampen the recent merger of the two companies. The union of the two chipmakers has come off much more smoothly than many analysts and rivals thought it would, without the bloodbath of personnel cuts and violent organizational disruptions predicted by some. National acquired struggling Fairchild on Oct. 1 for $ 122 million, after political pressure nixed a $ 200 million buyout by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and found a silicon treasure trove, according to National boss <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON>. There were layoffs as the combined companies trimmed from 38,000 to 36,000 workers and there were `` ruffled feathers,'' <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> admits, as employees made adjustments and, in some cases, switched jobs. But he says that a dynamic company has emerged from the merger, with a broad range of products, solid research departments and worldwide clout. `` I'm unaware of any other combination of two companies where a merger's been pulled off so well in such a short period of time,'' <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> said Thursday in his first interview on the merger since last fall. <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> said National will post revenue of about $ 2.5 billion when its 1988 fiscal year ends May 31, enabling the company to leap from 11th to fifth among world chip companies. He also estimated National would surpass the 12 percent growth rate he thinks the industry will post over the next year as it continues its recovery from a severe slump. `` The sum of the two companies is exceeding the parts involved,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boss </PERSON>, analyst for San Jose-based market research firm <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was n't apparent from the figures for 1987,'' <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> said, `` but we really expect this to be a very good year for National. We see some very good blending together of technologies and markets.'' <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> said National got more than it bargained for. `` Our estimates were conservative, both in terms of the financial impact and technology,'' he said. `` There was a perception on our part, as well as the industry's that Fairchild had a somewhat empty basket in terms of product. It was n't until after we truly started looking seriously that we realized that was a misconception.'' <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> said he particularly is impressed with Fairchild's high speed and custom chips used for supercomputers and military applications. Added to National's other lines of chips, the combined company can offer customers a wide range of technologies. `` There is a trend among customers to reduce the number of suppliers,'' he said. `` It saves money dealing with fewer people, and they realize, as we do, that more profitable relations occur when the two engineering organizations work closely together. `` It's a benefit we really did n't understand when we first started the Fairchild involvement.'' Huddled under golf umbrellas, Fairchild's eight founders gathered among about 2,000 guests Thursday as <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> praised it as `` the granddaddy of all semiconductor companies'' and dedicated the new $ 75 million Fairchild Research Center. It was National's way of preserving the name and spirit of the company that spawned <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s biggest chipmakers, including <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>, Advanced Micro Devices and National. `` Fairchild had tremendously talented people and an unusual, free-swinging environment,'' said <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON>, who joined Fairchild as a production manager and rose to head of the semiconductor division before he left to join National in 1967. `` They were prepared to accept unusual behavior from people given they have talent,'' he said. `` One of the negatives of that, of course, is we bred a lot of entrepreneurs and they went out and started a lot of companies, which was n't necessarily in the best interests of Fairchild. But all of us have a tinge of nostalgia for Fairchild.''

 Steel imports declined in February to the target set by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its quota program, except for metal imported by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies for rolling on their own mills. But American producers said Thursday that the 1.9 million tons imported in February in both categories represented the highest single-month level since November 1986. `` Increasing volume of semi-finished steel imports, badly needed by domestic rolling mills themselves, continues a trend evident since the beginning of 1988,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, president of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. The AIIS is composed largely of European steelmakers who sell products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> represents domestic companies. Both intepret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Department data separately. The importers said February steel imports, excluding 284,900 tons of semi-finished metal headed for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mills, totaled 1.6 million tons, or 18.8 percent of the domestic market. They said that's close to the 18.5 percent goal set by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in launching the quota program in late 1984. Including semi-finished steel, February imports represented 22.1 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. That was up from 21.8 percent in January, when 1.8 million tons entered the country, but down from 25 percent in February 1987, when 1.8 million tons entered a smaller domestic market, the <ORGANIZATION> AIIS </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers calculate the administration's goal as 20.2 percent of the market, including semi-finished steel. The importers said semi-finished steel represented 15 percent of February's total imports. `` Even these sharply increased semi-finished steel imports are still unable to satisfy demand, as indicated by escalating petitions of American rolling mills to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for short-supply allocation,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, vice chairman of the import firm <ORGANIZATION> STEELINTER </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The short supply petitions are requests for permission to import steel in excess of the quotas, which the administration negotiated at the request of the domestic producers. Unless extended, the quotas will expire in September 1989.

<HEAD>Steelmaker To Pay $85 Million In Pension Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed in principle to pay $ 85 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to settle all pension insurance claims against the company. Under the settlement announced Thursday, which is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> will pay about $ 60 million in cash and a secured note for $ 25 million upon confirmation of the troubled steelmaker's bankruptcy reorganization plan. The settlement is over <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> claims stemming from the termination of seven <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> pension plans serving 21,500 workers in November 1985, seven months after the company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law. <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency that insures pension plan participants against losses, says it has claims totaling more than $ 600 million, although the claims are limited by law to 30 percent of the company's net worth. In a news release issued from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> said the settlement granted it full recovery of its original claims for unpaid contributions due to the pension plans during the period the company filed for bankruptcy protection. `` This agreement provides <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> a substantial recovery, but allows the company to move ahead with its reorganization,'' <PERSON> sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellinger </PERSON>, the agency's chief negotiator. `` It also confirms that failure to meet pension promises is very costly. <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> stated that it was `` pleased that the parties were able to resolve their differences without further litigation, and that one of the major obstacles to a plan of reorganization has been removed.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Inflation in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> rose 0.4 percent in March from the previous month, while the country's unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percent, the government announced Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> attributed the rise in its retail price index to increases spread over a large range of goods and services, mostly for foods, motor vehicles, household goods, clothing and footwear. The index was 3.5 percent higher than in March 1987, the department said. Meanwhile, unemployment fell to a seasonally adjusted 9 percent of the work force last month from 9.1 percent in February. The figure was down from 10.9 percent in March 1987, the department said. Total seasonally adjusted unemployment was estimated at 2.505 million people in March, down from a revised 2.533 million in February and 3.037 million in March 1987.

 Safety violations discovered in six <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> planes during an unprecedented federal inspection involved mechanical problems that occur daily, a spokeswoman for the company said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> forced Eastern to take the planes out of service Thursday, the second day of an inspection of the company's 267 aircraft. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman characterized the safety flaws as `` minor violations.'' `` We have 1,400 flights a day, and every day you're going to have so many mechanical problems,'' company spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. `` They would have been found on this day or another day, and more than likely they would have been found by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s own mechanics. But we have people looking over our shoulder now.'' In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, an Atlanta-bound flight filled with passengers was unloaded because of a fuel leak. Eastern had cleared the plane for takeoff, but <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors refused to let it fly, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. Two other planes were also taken out of service because of minor fuel leaks, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. One plane was sidelined by cut tires and another by a problem with emergency escape path markings in the cabin, <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said. `` You're talking minor violations,'' he said. Late Thursday a sixth plane was taken out of service when an inch-long crack was discovered in the skin of a plane in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. He said it was not a serious problem. The airline can return the planes to service as soon as the problems are corrected. `` If -LRB- inspectors -RRB- find any irregularities, they bring them to the attention of the airline, who then takes the planes out of service until they fix them properly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said 54 other planes that had been checked as part of the inspection program were ruled safe for flying. Ms. <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said she did n't know whether the planes cited for violations had been repaired. The 30-day inspection of all Eastern planes began Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> fined the company $ 823,000 for safety violations. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said officials have been unsatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s performance since its takeover in 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which will undergo a 30-day inspection of its operating practices. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which commands a fifth of the nation's air travel market, also owns <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has recently absorbed <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The government's financial probe will examine the corporation's management and business practices and the relationships between the parent and the two airlines, said <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Around Eastern's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> home base, passengers and travel agents said the inspection and new fines were worrisome. `` Some of my customers already do n't want to fly on Eastern anymore,'' said <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalen </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said there has been no drop in bookings. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said its unprecedented inspection of Eastern planes will include `` ramp checks'' of all of the carrier's aircraft. `` It's a visual inspection of the aircraft while it's parked at the gate. The inspectors also will look at the log book, to make sure the entries are correctly entered, they will check the emergency equipment and that's basically what we're looking at,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 Stock prices showed some further losses in active trading today after Thursday's steep slide. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.30 to 2,000.34 in the first half hour of trading. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 224 up, 835 down and 424 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 33.80 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some early buying by traders looking for `` bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday. But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles in any bid to rebound. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of inflationary pressures. At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets, pushing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds close to the 8.95 percent level. Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade deficit widened in February.

 Billionaire real estate baron <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his `` hotel queen'' wife <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> underwent fingerprinting and mug shots, then quietly sat with other alleged wrongdoers before pleading innocent to charges in a 188-count state tax evasion indictment. Less than an hour later, a federal tax evasion indictment was announced against the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's wealthiest couples, who own the Empire State Building and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Helmsley Palace Hotel and are estimated to be worth at least $ 1.4 billion They were arraigned Thursday on state charges that they hid about $ 4 million in renovations to their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion _ including a pool enclosure with a rooftop marble dance floor and a $ 45,000 clock in the shape of one of their buildings _ as business expenses and took bogus tax deductions. `` Not guilty!'' both replied in strong voices before <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, who rejected a prosecution request for $ 1 million bails and released them on their own recognizance. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 79, and his 67-year-old wife had waited in the front row of the courtroom while alleged drug dealers and thieves were arraigned ahead of them. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> appeared depressed and at one point her eyes welled with tears, smudging her mascara. `` The fact is they did not pay millions of dollars in income tax,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said 45 minutes later in announcing a 47-count federal tax evasion indictment against the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> on similar charges. As many as 30 past and current <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees reportedly were given immunity from prosecution in return for testimony before state and federal grand juries. `` It's the only palace in the world where the Queen stands guard,'' says ads for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, but employees say that royal appellation is matched by a volatile, queen-size temper. `` She comes on as extremely forthright, but that sometimes turns into brutality,'' said one former employee, advertising executive <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>. `` She's icy, without compassion; she is remorseless and pitiless.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> recently turned down a deal from prosecutors, who said they would not seek the indictment of her ailing husband if she pleaded guilty to fraud, a source said. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, in a two-page statement, said the couple had never evaded taxes and actually pay more than nearly anyone else in the nation. The indictments were the result of an 18-month state and federal probe, officials said. Prior to their arraignment, the Helmsleys were booked and fingerprinted at Police Headquarters `` like anybody else,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. `` They received no special treatment whatsoever.'' The Helmsleys greeted reporters when they arrived at the attorney general's office in a gray limousine, followed by a second limousine with their security guards. According to the indictments, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 4 million to refurbish their mansion with an enclosure for one of the estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on the roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $ 370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of furniture and paintings. In addition, a $ 45,000 birthday present for <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ a clock in the shape of the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue _ was billed to the <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in December 1984, it said. The charges also said four jade art objects worth $ 500,000 were paid for by four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotels as furniture purchases in 1984. Their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> estate consists of a 28-room Tudor mansion on 29 acres. They also have a duplex atop the Park Lane Hotel in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and a condominium in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Also pleading innocent to the state charges were <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s former top aide, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the couple's former financial manager Both were also named in the federal indictment. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the advertised `` queen'' of the couple's hotel chain, and <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> face an additional federal charge of extortion conspiracy for allegedly accepting kickbacks from <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> suppliers and employees. Each state felony count carries with it up to four years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine; the federal counts carry sentences of up to five years in prison and fines of up to $ 250,000. The extortion conspiracy count, however, can bring up to 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. State prosecutors requested $ 100,000 bail for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' aides, but all four were released on their own recognizance pending a June 1 court date They are due in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on April 21 for arraignment on the federal charges.

 The news that entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will take control of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> surprised industry observers who watched the two men squabble. But in announcing the preliminary agreement Thursday, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> denied he and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had ever been at odds. `` I made my offer. He refused it. There was a lot of posturing and a lot of public statements made,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said, calling the dealmaking of the past several weeks `` a great tennis game.'' The agreement calls for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to purchase Resorts' Class A shares for $ 36 a share, or a total of about $ 206 million, and to buy <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s more powerful Class B shares at an undisclosed price well above the $ 101 million that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> paid last year. Although the agreement remains to be finalized on paper, the biggest speculation is how much <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will receive for his Class B stock. All <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> would say Thursday was that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was paid `` a lot. -LRB- I -RRB- could n't let him off easy, right? ... We do n't want <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> to take a loss on the B stock.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, a gambling industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also speculated that `` Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would n't make a deal if it was n't good for him.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> now controls Resorts by owning 95 percent of the company's outstanding Class B shares, and had tried since February to take the company private, offering $ 22 for each of the company's 5.7 million outstanding shares of Class A stock <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the deal `` allows <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to have another casino operating while the Taj is operating.'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> referred to the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier decision allowing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to close Resorts' casino in order to open the Taj Mahal Under state law, no one may own more than three casinos. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns Trump Plaza and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s Castle casino hotels in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and opening the Taj Mahal would put him at the limit. <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> `` is certainly happy because he'll have one of the finest collections of real estate parcels in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said he would not be surprised if <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> sold off Resorts' <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> property to his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> neighbor, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Last year, the oilman offered to buy the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> operation for up to $ 260 million. For 23 years, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> served as host of the popular `` <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> Show,'' one of television's longest-running series, winning 10 Emmy Awards. He parlayed his entertainment fortune into a business empire that includes radio stations, a major closed-circuit television operation widely used at racetracks and extensive real estate holdings in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. As part of the agreement with <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> says he will buy the 1,250-room <ORGANIZATION> Taj </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mahal </ORGANIZATION> and the nearby Steel Pier from Resorts for an undisclosed price. The gaming hall, with an estimated completion cost of $ 938.5 million, is under construction next door to the Resorts' existing Boardwalk casino. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing the owners of about 800,000 shares of Class A stock, said he doubts his clients will be unhappy with the tentative agreement. The $ 36-a share offer, he said, `` is nearly double <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer _ it's a lot better than $ 22 a share. I think this is an extraordinary solution of a very difficult problem because of the personalities involved and the complexities of the deal.''

 The chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> say they expect agreement soon on a plan to halt trading in stocks and stock-index futures when the markets rise or fall 200 to 300 points in one day. The heads of the two fiercely competitive exchanges _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for stocks and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for futures _ on Thursday told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel examining the October stock market collapse that they hoped to agree on the plan within the next month. However, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchange's executive committee, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, differed on just how far the markets should move before trading is interrupted <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the trading should not be halted until the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves 250 to 300 points, while <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said the limits should be in the range of 200 to 250 points. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said since October they have met several times in an effort to achieve greater coordination. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders _ particularly <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finance subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass _ had been complaining about the lack of progress in talks among the exchanges and among federal regulatory agencies. `` You've got to let the market seek its own level, but there comes a time when a systematic halt _ a safety net _ that is known in advance is helpful,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said. `` In the futures market, we are not uncomfortable with price limits; we already have them,'' <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said. `` It just depends on where you draw the line.'' He said short halts in trading `` are a necessary evil, perhaps, but something we could live with.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the purpose of the halts would be to allow the market `` to stop and take a look at itself.'' He said they should be more than 30 minutes but should not last all day. Both chairmen told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finance subcommittee that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new working group on the markets has indicated a circuit-breaker plan is a high priority. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> limits a form of computerized trading known as index arbitrage _ which links the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock markets with the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets _ once the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> moves 50 points, either up or down. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchange has set daily price limits on its <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index future, which is based on stocks traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. There is an opening price limit that restricts any move during the first l0 minutes of trading to the equivalent of roughly 40 points on the Dow and a daily price limit equivalent to between 120 and 150 Dow points. But such circuit breakers are not coordinated between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> also said regulation of the nation's financial markets by a single federal agency would do `` a great disservice'' to the marketplace and that it `` is neither warranted nor wise.'' Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> oversees the nation's futures markets and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulates securities trading. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said he believes one regulator should eventually be in charge of all the markets. `` We believe ... that ultimately there should be a unified regulator for all equity-related products,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> testified. `` But more immediately, it is much more important that we strengthen the clearing and settlement process as well as put in place an all-market circuit breaker in the event of a major market decline.'' <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said the roles of the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> are so different that they should not be combined. `` The number of true intermarket issues are few and limited in scope,'' <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> told the panel. `` Moreover, they must be resolved now, not when the next crisis occurs.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has given its workforce in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a 15-day paid furlough because of the extreme difficulty in doing business there, a company spokesman said today. The catalyst for the shutdown of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing facility, retail film and camera shops and mini-lab processing centers was last Friday's economic sanctions imposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON>. `` We were n't ordered to close, but it just does n't make sense to stay open,'' <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. `` We are not permitted to pay our utility bill. We ca n't pay the phone bill. We were also concerned about the security of our people traveling in that country.'' The sanctions were ordered April 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in an effort to force military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to surrender his hold on the Central American country. They include prohibiting payments to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime by all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and organizations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, freezing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets of the Panamanian government, and prohibiting any person or company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from making any payments to the regime. <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said he did n't have an exact figure on the number of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> employees, but estimated it was less than 1,000. He said the furlough went into effect Tuesday. `` After the 15 days we'll reevaluate and reassess and determine whether there should be another furlough,'' <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. `` We hope the situation will stabilize within a month.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> would continue to service its copiers in the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> and will keep its photo processing mini-labs open there.

 The world's top financial leaders did their best to reassure jittery financial markets today amid signs that their multimillion-dollar effort to stabilize the value of the dollar was working. The finance leaders, wrapping up the spring meeting of the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, issued an optimistic communique that predicted continued global economic growth despite the turmoil on financial markets. Dutch Finance Minister <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON> said the sharp selloff of the dollar Thursday had not changed the view that growth prospects this year remain bright. `` Members were aware of the developments in the markets -LRB- during their deliberations Thursday -RRB- but it has not changed dramatically the actions of our meetings because we are trying to improve the system regardless of the vagaries of the market from day to day,'' <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON> told reporters. Still, the rout of the dollar on world currency markets Thursday represented a major embarrassment for the finance leaders coming as it did only 18 hours after they had issued a glowing assessment of the global economy. The world's seven largest economies, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, had bragged in their joint statement on Wednesday of the success they had had in the last four months in keeping the dollar from falling further. The so-called Group of Seven renewed their pledge to cooperate closely in coming months to keep the dollar stable. That commitment was tested dramatically on Thursday as the dollar suffered its worst decline since late last year as nervous investors dumped the greenback following a disappointing increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for February. The dollar traded in a narrow range today after dropping about 2 percent on Thursday against such currencies as the Japanese yen, West German mark and British pound. Central banks continued to prop up the dollar by buying dollars with other currencies on the open market. Administration sources, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> held a hasty 10-minute discussion with his counterparts from other nations Thursday in the midst of the dollar's decline. These sources said the finance ministers discussed their joint efforts to intervene to break the dollar's fall by government purchases of the greenback. Currency traders estimated that the amount of government intervention may have totaled as much as $ 700 million on Thursday alone. Sources at the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> meeting confirmed that there was further intervention taking place today. Those efforts seemed to be working as the dollar edged up slightly in early trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> amid reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> were buying dollars. Finance ministers could only hope that the latest turmoil in foreign exchange markets would not lead to a prolonged test of their commitments to spend the resources of their treasuries or trigger renewed turmoil on stock exchanges and on the bond market. Even after Thursday's market turmoil, the finance ministers were looking for a silver lining, noting that the massive intervention, while costing substantial sums, had kept the dollar from going into a free fall. `` The Group of Seven is not daunted by this,'' said Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> late Thursday. German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the hectic dollar trading was `` not threatening'' as the economic leaders let it be known they stood ready to spend more sums if necessary to stabilize the dollar. `` I think what you see today is a very good example of international cooperation because there has been concerted intervention in support of the dollar involving a very large number of countries,'' <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the British chancellor of the exchequer, told reporters. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the prime architect of the three-year effort to manage the dollar, said the markets were wrong to read so much into one month's adverse trade report. He said the overall trend was toward a lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and this development was being aided by the efforts of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to stimulate their domestic demand, something the administration has long urged. `` Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic. What is important is that we are continuing along the general path of reduced imbalances,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Thursday in a speech to the finance ministers. The administration is counting on improvements in the American trade deficit to supply fully half of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth this year, one of the reasons that markets react so negatively if the monthly trade figures do n't show improvement. The $ 13.8 billion February trade imbalance was up 11 percent from the January deficit and was the worst showing since last October's record $ 17.6 billion deficit. The problem in February was that a surge in imports swamped further improvement in exports. `` The nation's trade problems are severe and far from over,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist. `` While exports are up by $ 10 billion from a year ago, so are imports, leaving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> no further along the path towards reducing the jobs-destroying deficit.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been struggling with the trade problem ever since he took over as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary at the start of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term in 1985 <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> switched administration policy in September 1985 from a hands-off approach concerning the dollar to a coordinated effort with other countries to drive the dollar lower as a way of curbing Americans' appetite for foreign goods and boosting the competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products overseas. After the dollar had fallen substantially throughout 1986, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reversed course again in February 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> countries declared that the dollar had fallen enough. They served notice that the seven nations would begin intervening to support the dollar's value. That declaration proved ineffective for much of 1987 as the dollar came under renewed selling pressure, but a new dollar-stabilization pact reached Dec. 22 had appeared to be working until Thursday's sell-off.

 Wholesale prices jumped 0.6 percent in March, the biggest increase in 11 months, the government said today in a report that added to jitters on financial markets about inflation and the health of the economy. The March increase more than erased a 0.2 percent drop in Feburary. If the March rate held for 12 months, the full-year wholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for all of The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks, which staged its fifth biggest loss and dropped more than 101 points Thursday in reaction to disappointing trade figures, fell 22 points to 1983.75 in the first 90 minutes of trading today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in today's report on wholesale price activity that energy prices, which had been falling at an annual rate of 17 percent, rose 0.9 percent last month, their first increase since August. Food prices, after dropping 1.1 percent in February, advanced by 0.7 percent last month. For the first three months of the year, beef and veal prices climbed 43.6 percent. Overall, wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent from January through March. `` The widespread nature of these price changes suggests that inflation pressures may be intensifying,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist who specializes in wholesale price trends. <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> and other economists anticiated that today's price report would add to the havoc evident Thursday following the government's announcement that the nation's trade deficit worsened significantly in February. `` Yesterday's news and the flailings of the lemmings on Wall Street combined with today's price numbers are going to create a volatile climate for a while,'' said <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dongen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesalers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Again, they were a surprise and above the predictions of all the experts.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was `` disappointed'' with the increase in wholesale prices today as well as the trade figures Thursday. `` We think the market has overreacted to a one-time report, and we hope this thing will stabilize,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Reflecting the broad nature of March's price gains, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that its index of wholesale prices for consumer goods other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in February. Because food and energy prices can fluctuate greatly from month to month, analysts look to the calculation that excludes them as providing a good underlying indication of inflationary pressures. For the first three months of 1988, wholesale prices for goods other than food and energy rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent. Automobile prices were up 1 percent last month, restoring them to the level they had been at in November before manufacturers began offering dealers rebates and other incentives. Prescription drug prices rose 1.3 percent and over-the-counter drug costs advanced 2 percent in March. Newspaper prices rose 1.4 percent. Wholesale gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after dropping about 9 percent since November. Home heating oil prices jumped 2.6 percent. Costs rose for a variety of food products that had dropped in price in February. Among them were eggs, fresh fruits, coffee, poultry, fish and pasta products. Other goods showing 1 percent or greater price increases one step short of the retail level included carpeting, draperies and jewelry. Capital equipment prices rose 0.4 percent, double the increases of January and February. The biggest price gains _ above 1 percent _ were in metal-cutting machine tools and office and store equipment. Prices dropped slightly, however, for other goods, including women's clothing, shoes, cosmetics, glassware and home electronic equipment. March's overall gain brought the wholesale price index to 106.2. That means a selection of good costing $ 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $ 106.20 last month, or 30 cents more than in February. Wholesale prices rose only 2.2 percent for all of 1987. The index, however, does not include two categories where price increases have been more pronounced in recent months _ services and imports. Those two categories are included in the consumer price index, which rose 4.4 percent last year. Consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running at an annual rate of 3.2 percent. Figures on retail price activity in March will not be out until later this month.

 The stock market remained on the defensive today, extending Thursday's steep slide amid increased inflation worries. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 101.46 points on Thursday, fell 9.78 to 1,995.86 by noontime today on Wall Street. Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 7 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 316 up, 1,167 down and 346 unchanged. Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some tentative buying by traders looking for `` bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday.

<HEAD>Equilibrium at a Very High Level</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy is now at a stage where too much `` good'' news could have bad effects, in much the same way an extra helping of dessert can ruin the digestion. It is a tricky situation for the economy to be in, and it is being watched closely by everyone on Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the forecasting fraternity. The reason is that the economy is now in critical balance. The capacity of plants and factories may be nearing the maximum, for example, so you do n't want a lot of additional activity. That might spur inflation. It could mean a big demand for more workers, too. And since the jobless rate is now at a seven-year low of 5.6 percent any pressure there could upset the wage contentment that has existed for several years. A production spurt could mean higher interest rates as well, and that of course could be bad for securities, homebuying and credit-card borrowing, not to mention spending by business to alleviate the condition with added capacity. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>, consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, puts its this way: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operating level is too high for strong economic news to be good for either the bond market or the equity market.'' Therefore, he and many of his forecasting brethren are looking for a slow but steady pace of economic expansion, something in the area of 2 percent or less. If that happens, they say, equilibrium elsewhere might be maintained. But seldom have economists needed their limbs more than today, because almost every look into the future is conditioned by `` on the other hand.'' And just a slight economic change might require immediate use of that hand. As you might expect, there is still some disagreement on how near the manufacturing segment is to full production. The official rate, as of February, was 82.5 percent, or 3 points higher than the average for 1970-1988. Many analysts view the current level as close to maximum, beyond which there would be an increasing likelihood of production strains, resulting in the hiring of less skilled workers, falling productivity and rising prices. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> Investors' Service, recognized for its skill with statistics, has another viewpoint. It points out that from 1950 through 1959, inflation was at a minimum while plant utilization rose as high as 91.7 percent. And at one point in the relatively calm 1960s the rate was almost as high. It would take at least two years of robust growth before the nation's overall factory operating rates would exceed 85 percent, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and even then there would be a question of whether concerns were legitimate. That view seems not to be the most widely accepted one, however, and so a great deal of tension exists among investors and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> about the possibility of good news _ strong production _ being bad news. It explains to some extent the inability of the securities markets to make pronounced moves in either direction. It explains why slow rather than fast economic growth is `` in.'' Considering what the country has been through _ the extremes of inflation, high interest rates and recession within the span of a decade _ it is n't the worst of situations.

<NOTE>Eds: updates with close.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices closed lower Friday, but well above their worst levels of the day as bargain-hunting and takeover rumors helped the market regain some lost ground. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 selected stocks fell 8.6 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,778.6. The index fell 24.1 points at the opening, but dealers said the real low for the day came in trading before the official opening, when the index was down as much as 38 points. Volume was moderate at 472.9 million shares, down from 517.3 million on Thursday. Share prices were marked down sharply from the outset of trading, following Thursday's plunge on Wall Street, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average lost more than 100 points. But British institutional buyers were attracted by the low prices and the market rose steadily in the morning until it was down 4.6 points in the early afternoon. Weakness in the early going on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> took <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> prices down from their best levels. However, dealers were heartened by the market's resilience in the face of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s sell-off Thursday. `` We're coming into the area where the market is looking attractive to fund managers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, European equities strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Retreats Further on New Economic Data, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished lower against major foreign currencies on Friday after another disappointing set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators, but dealers said central bank intervention tempered its fall. The pound rose strongly as investors again moved in to take advantage of higher British interest rates. Gold prices moved up around the globe. The dollar was hurt by news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer prices increased a larger-than-expected 0.6 percent during March and that industrial output climbed 0.1 percent, less than expected, during the month. However, any further fall in the dollar was tempered by reported intervention from the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` The dealers did n't wish to take on the central banks,'' one trader said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.90 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8890 to buy one pound, dearer than $ 1.8755 Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6605 West German marks, down from 1.6635; 1.3720 Swiss francs, down from 1.3745; 5.6325 French francs, down from 5.6390; 1.8630 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,232.50 Italian lire, down from 1,244.00; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2368 Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 456.25 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 451. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 455.50, compared with $ 450.50 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 5.45 to close at a bid $ 454.93. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.49 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 6.43.

 Stock prices declined broadly today, extending Thursday's steep slide amid increased inflation worries. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 101.46 points on Thursday, lost .67 to 2,004.97 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street. Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 457 up, 1,037 down and 417 unchanged. Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some tentative buying by traders looking for `` bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday. But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles in any bid to rebound. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of inflationary pressures. At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets, pushing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds close to the 8.95 percent level. Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade deficit widened in February. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down -LCB- at 40 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 \ at 24 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 -LRB- at 158 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 82 An exception was <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, which rose 2 -LRB- to 113 -LCB-. Earlier this week, the company reported a first-quarter earnings gain that drew high marks from most analysts. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 47 -RCB- in active trading. The company, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection, voted a 75-cents-a-share quarterly dividend and expanded the plans for its restructuring program. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell .60 to 146.54. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 1.10 at 297.82.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported a 68 percent jump in its first quarter profit over a year ago. Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $ 14.3 million, or 77 cents a share, compared with earnings of $ 8.5 million, or 44 cents, in 1987. Revenue totaled $ 84.1 million vs. $ 80.7 million. Operating income, however, fell from $ 22.9 million to $ 18.4 million, the company said. The jump in revenue was attributed largely to the acquisition of full ownership in <ORGANIZATION> Comsat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was added to the company in the second quarter of last year. This was partially offset, though, by a decline in revenue from <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. While international business was up, revenue declined because of rate reductions to customers under long-term contracts, <ORGANIZATION> Comsat </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Comsat </ORGANIZATION> provides international, domestic and maritime communications facilities via satellite and researches communications techniques.

<HEAD>Bond Market Jolted by Unexpected Economic Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bond market got an earful of economic news this past week, and did n't like a lot of what it heard. `` It was a week of surprises, all of them negative,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> of the financial consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Griggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The reports on March retail sales and wholesale prices and the February trade deficit indicated the economy is growing faster than post-stock market crash pessimists had expected and that inflation may be accelerating. Faster economic growth and rising prices are the enemy in the bond market, and prices slumped on the news, pushing long-term yields toward their highest levels since they exceeded 9 percent in mid-January. By midafternoon Friday, the prices of some long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds were priced to yield 8.93 percent, up from 8.68 percent at the end of the previous week and from 8.3 percent in early February. The government reported Wednesday that retail sales rose 0.8 percent in March, stronger than most analysts had expected. `` It was another indication that the consumer has the ability to spend and is doing it,'' <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> said. More disconcerting was news the next day that the nation's trade deficit had widened to $ 13.8 billion in February. Most analysts had expected a contraction in the deficit to the $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion range. Continued strength in imports raised the possibility that inflation would accelerate, possibly prompting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit conditions in an effort to ward off higher prices. Adding to inflation concerns was Friday's report that wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in March or about twice as fast as most analysts had expected. `` That was one more bit of bad news that the market could have done without,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said next month's wholesale price figure could be even worse if oil prices continue their recent rise. Most economists caution against reading too much into any single economic report, noting that they are often subject to revision. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the rise in wholesale prices nonetheless indicates `` something is going on, on the inflation front that is pretty negative.'' `` I had thought April was going to be difficult, and this raises the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will have to tighten further,'' he said. `` They may not do it right away but if we get some strong employment figures for April, it would leave them no alternative.'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Won </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said the series of economic reports `` was extremely disappointing'' because the consensus estimates were wrong in each case. <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> said he had expected long-term rates would decline in May, but said the latest reports prompted him to delay that projection. He is now looking for long-term rates to edge up to 9 percent and not begin falling until July or August. He expects long-term rates will be as low as 8.3 percent by November. <ORGANIZATION> DLJ </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> expects long-term rates will rise as high as 9.25 percent by the end of the month, but then decline as low as 8 percent by early summer. But <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> is decidedly more pessimistic. He said the gyrations in the dollar have introduced a new element of risk for foreign buyers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities, and that rates will rise to compensate them for that. Combined with the federal government's continuing strong borrowing demands and an expected acceleration of inflation, <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> said he expects long-term rates will rise to 10 percent or more by the end of the year. <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON> is looking for long-term rates to stay in a narrow range, rising to 9 percent before slipping to 8.75 percent during May. `` There is enough skittishness in the economy right now that there is a self-correcting mechanism at work under which rising rates dampen certain kinds of economic activity and that leads rates to fall,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The new advertising agency started by former officers of <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been temporarily prohibited from accepting any more employees or clients from Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> of state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> made the ruling on Thursday, extending an April 6 order that barred two of the new agency's founders, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, from recruiting Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> clients or staff for the new agency, Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> & amp; Partners. But the ruling does not affect employees or clients who have already made the switch. The judge said the order will remain in effect until a court hearing later this month. No specific date was set. Six top executives walked off their jobs at Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> on March 18 to form the new agency, complaining that they felt constrained under the ownership of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British firm that bought <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geller </ORGANIZATION> in its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> JWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in July 1987. They have been joined by several dozen former Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> employees at the new agency. Two Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> clients, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine and <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, said they were switching to the new agency and a third client, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was assigning some short-term projects to the new agency. <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> filed suit against the former executives, charging they breached their duties to the agency and conspired to take away business. <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> had requested that the judge expand his April 6 order to apply to the agency as well as to Lord and <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>.

 Soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid heavy liquidation by speculative investment funds. The grains also closed lower.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday extended for a sixth time the deadline for debtholders to tender securities required under a $ 1.5 billion federally assisted reorganization plan. The company also announced that its completion date for the reorganization was rescheduled to next Tuesday instead of Friday as planned. `` The revised schedule will provide additional time to complete financing arrangements and to circulate additional information to prospective investors, including the current status of the debt tender,'' said <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>. Thursday was the fifth deadline for debt holders who have balked at tendering holdings at a loss. Participation had been lowered from 90 percent to 70 percent.

 Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture Friday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHOLESALE PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Energy and food prices shot upward as wholesale prices jumped 0.6 percent in March, the biggest increase in 11 months. The increase erased a 0.2 percent drop in Feburary. If the March rate held for 12 months, the annual inflation rate would be 7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for all of 1987. Overall, wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent from January through March.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged up 0.1 percent in March, somewhat counterbalancing signs that inflation is reheating. Gains in production of autos and business equipment offset declines in construction supplies and consumer goods other than cars. The slight March advance followed no change in February and, according to economists, indicates that the pickup in wholesale prices may not be sustained.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVESTMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Businesses plan to increase capital spending by 8 percent this year to $ 419.9 billion, raising hopes manufacturers will expand factory capacity enough to ease inflation pressures. It would be the best gain since a 9.6 percent rise in 1985. Businesses spent $ 388.7 billion last year, a 1.7 percent increase over 1986. The estimate, based on a survey completed in March, represented an increase over a November survey, when businesses said they planned to spend 7.3 percent more.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WALL STREET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices were widely mixed, showing signs of steadying after Thursday's steep slide. The Dow Jones average rose 8.29 to 2,013.93, reducing its loss for the week to 76.26 points. At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets, pushing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds close to the 8.95 percent level.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished lower against other currencies after the wholesale prices report, but dealers said central bank intervention tempered its fall. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.90 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8890 to buy 1 pound, higher than $ 1.8755 Thursday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCE MINISTERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 World finance leaders ended a tumultuous meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> with words of assurance to nervous financial markets and further efforts to rescue the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The dollar's rout shattered the optimistic tone the finance ministers hoped to impart in their first high-level discussions since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. The group's final communique predicted continued growth for the world economy this year at a `` steady, moderate'' pace. World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the overriding issue facing the two lending organizations was reducing the poor countries' debt burden, estimated to total $ 1.245 trillion by the end of this year.

<HEAD>Texaco Reinstates Dividend; To Sell $2 Billion More in Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it will resume paying a quarterly dividend and will sell off an additional $ 2 billion in assets as part of its restructuring. At its first meeting since <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy court reorganization on April 7, the oil giant's board of directors authorized a 75-cent quarterly dividend, a move analysts said is intended to bolster shareholder support for the current management team In closing trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 1.62 -LCB- to $ 48.75. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had been barred from paying dividends after it filed for bankruptcy protection on April 12, 1987, in the wake of its epic legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The dividend will be paid June 10 to shareholders of record May 3. In addition to authorizing the dividend, directors said they planned to sell off $ 5 billion in assets to help reduce the company's debt load. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said in its 1987 annual report that it hoped to raise at least $ 3 billion through the sale of assets, but Friday's action increased that amount by $ 2 billion. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement that the resumption of dividends `` at a substantial rate demonstrates <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s confidence that this expanded restructuring will enable us to build a more profitable company on a solid core of our most productive assets.'' While <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> can afford the roughly $ 726 million a year in dividend payments, experts noted that the extra expense will eat up nearly 100 percent of the company's projected earnings for the year. The $ 3-a-share annual dividend `` is not justified by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s current earnings prospects,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazier </PERSON>, vice president for energy investments at <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They probably will not earn much more than the $ 3 -LRB- a share -RRB- rate. <PERSON> Lazier </PERSON> called the dividend decision a `` defensive move'' designed to offer shareholders an incentive to `` ride along with current management'' rather than side with corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder and sharpest critic. `` For shareholders hoping for liquidation, this is a nail in that coffin,'' <PERSON> Lazier </PERSON> said, referring to rumors that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would have been dismembered if <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> won control. He unsuccessfully sought a board seat. Speculation had been brewing in recent weeks that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would take some action to boost the value of its stock, so Friday's announcement was not a complete surprise `` I think -LRB- the dividend -RRB- will quell a lot of shareholder'' dissent, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Alen </PERSON>, an oil analyst at <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. As part of its asset sale, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said it would dispose of unidentified `` producing, manufacturing and marketing assets, both domestic and overseas.'' Last week <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it is negotiating to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which operates 1,903 gas stations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials said the operation could fetch as much as $ 1.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> previously announced plans to sell 60 million barrels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil and natural gas reserves. <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said in a statement issued from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that the asset sales would serve to `` de-emphasize our presence in manufacturing and marketing.'' He said the company also would `` pursue rigorous programs to streamline management and to set and achieve strict operating and financial objectives.'' Under a reorganization plan approved March 23 by a federal bankruptcy court judge, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> transferred $ 3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> on April 7 to settle its 4-year legal battle with the Houston-based company. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond while appealing a $ 10 billion damage judgment awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> by a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury in November 1985. The award stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> had agreed to sell part of its assets to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. Also at the board meeting, former <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was elected to the board of directors to replace <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who resigned <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> is the managing partner of <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held merchant banking company based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed on New Economic Data, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed mixed against major foreign currencies Friday amid speculation that interest rates would soon rise. Gold prices increased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 455.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 452.65 late Thursday. The government's announcement of a 0.6 percent increase in wholesale prices for March was viewed as mildly bullish and had a stabilizing influence on the dollar, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders believed the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be moved to tighten credit _ thereby raising interest rates _ to counter a surge in inflation Higher interest rates would have a calming effect on the dollar, which fell sharply on Thursday after the government released disappointing balance of trade figures. Another government report Friday, of a 0.1 percent in industrial production, produced market speculation that companies were buying foreign machinery to increase their output, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. Traders believe higher output would lead to increased exports, and eventually a shrinkage in the nation's trade deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the deficit widened to $ 13.8 billion in February. Financial markets had expected the gap to narrow. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> described trading Friday as quiet. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar fell, but central bank intervention tempered its slide, dealers said. While American markets interpreted Friday's economic figures as positive for the dollar, overseas traders saw them in a negative light and sold dollars. The wholesale price figure was larger than expected and the industrial output number was lower than anticipated. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ended before the figures were released, the dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.90 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it rose to 123.80 yen from 123.725 yen late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8890 to buy one pound, higher than $ 1.8755 Thursday. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, sterling rose to $ 1.9003 from $ 1.8739. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.66095 West German marks, down from 1.66275; 1.3725 Swiss francs, up from 1.3720; 5.6345 French francs, up from 5.6325; 1,232.625 Italian lire, down from 1,233.00; and 1.2333 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2365. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.6605 West German marks, down from 1.6635; 1.3720 Swiss francs, down from 1.3745; 5.6325 French francs, down from 5.6390; 1.8630 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,232.50 Italian lire, down from 1,244.00; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2368. Gold rose on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, closing at $ 455.90 a troy ounce, compared with $ 452.65 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, bullion rose to a late bid price of $ 456.25 an ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 451. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 455.50 an ounce, compared with $ 450.50 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 5.45 to close at a bid $ 454.93 an ounce. Silver rose on the Comex in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It closed at $ 6.455 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.325 late Thursday. Silver also rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.49 an ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 6.43.

 Oil prices continued to advance Friday in light trading, reaching the highest levels since December.

Traders said Friday's gains were based largely on internal market influences rather than any outside news. `` What you have today is more of an absence of sellers rather than any aggressive buying,'' said <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a trader in the energy futures department at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The nation got its first big dose of inflation this year as wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in March, the government said Friday. The report sent new tremors through financial markets already shaken by a worsening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s producer price index rose 0.6 percent last month, marking the biggest increase since April 1987 and more than erasing a 0.2 percent decline in February. Falling energy and food prices that had been keeping a lid on inflationary pressures shot upwards in March, as did wholesale prices for a wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital equipment. The price data provided the followup blow in a one-two punch that government statisticians delivered on the state of the economy. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit expanded by $ 1.4 billion or 11 percent to $ 13.8 billion in February when all predictions had called for it to narrow The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip stocks dropped 101 points on the news Thursday _ its fifth biggest decline in history _ but the market stabilized Friday and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> closed up 8.29 points. `` I do n't know that the markets are going to digest two doses of really quite bad medicine too quickly,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> brokerage. `` The trade number is easier to explain away because it bounces up and down, but not the price figures,'' <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> said. `` The 2 percent and 3 percent inflation we have been enjoying _ we probably will no longer.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration was disappointed by the increase in wholesale prices and the trade deficit. `` We think the market has overreacted to a one-time report, and we hope this thing will stabilize,'' he said. But analysts said upward pressure on prices is only going to worsen in the months ahead, stirring speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> might tighten credit to both prevent the dollar from losing further value and dampen inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last raised the discount rate it charges for loans to banks in September 1987. A month later the stock market collapsed with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrials </ORGANIZATION> dropping 518 points, partly in reaction to higher interest rates from the credit tightening. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, expressed fears Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will `` overreact to perceived inflationary pressures that some see in the recent data'' and stymie economic growth `` Oversteering in the face of monthly price swings can only feed fears of inflation,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said, referring to figures that show the annual wholesale price increases of just 3.1 percent when averaged over the past three months. However, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist who specializes in wholesale price trends, said increases in April will match, if not exceed, those in March. `` This is n't a one-month aberration,'' <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said. `` Strong increases in raw material prices that have been going on for six months are widening and spreading. It's not runaway inflation, but it's a little worrying.'' Wholesale energy prices, which had dropped at an annual rate of 17 percent since last August, shot up 0.9 percent in March. Gasoline prices climbed 1.5 percent last month after dropping about 9 percent since November. And home heating oil prices jumped 2.6 percent. Food prices, after dropping 1.1 percent in February, advanced by 0.7 percent in March. For the first three months of the year, beef and veal prices have climbed 43.6 percent. Reflecting the broad nature of March's price gains, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its index of wholesale prices for consumer goods other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in February. For the first three months of 1988, those non-energy, non-food wholesale prices are up at an annual rate of 5.7 percent. Automobile prices were up 1 percent last month, restoring them to the level they had been at in November before manufacturers began offering rebates and other incentives. Prescription drug prices rose 1.3 percent, over-the-counter drugs were up 2 percent and the price of newspapers climbed 1.4 percent in March. Other goods showing 1 percent or greater price increases one step short of the retail level included carpeting, draperies and jewelry. Capital equipment prices rose 0.4 percent, double the increases of January and February. The biggest price gains _ above 1 percent _ were in metal-cutting machine tools and office and store equipment. In a related report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that businesses planning to increase their capital spending by 8 percent this year after raising it by only 1.7 percent in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> report reflected increasing optimistism about the economy among businessman who, when last surveyed in December, said they planned to increase their capital spending by 7.3 percent this year. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported that industrial production edged up just 0.1 percent in March. Analysts said that report was the only indication that the economy is not overheating following a long string of data suggesting that it is. As for wholesale prices, the March gain brought the producer price index to 106.2. That means a selection of good costing $ 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $ 106.20 last month, or 30 cents more than in February. Wholesale prices rose only 2.2 percent for all of 1987. The index, however, does not include two categories where price increases have been more pronounced in recent months _ services and imports. Those two categories are included in the consumer price index, which rose 4.4 percent last year. Consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running at an annual rate of 3.2 percent. Figures on retail price activity in March will be released later this month.

 Sheet and towel giant <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its board has backed a $ 1.22 billion buyout bid from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, spurning a lower offer from rival fabric maker <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the continuing takeover battle for the textile giant, <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> was offering $ 68.50 a share in cash for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' outstanding shares under a tender offer due to expire April 22 The company sweetened its offer to that level in a frenzied auction Monday, just hours after <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> boosted its own tender offer to $ 67 a share in cash, or about $ 1.19 billion. The current bids represent the third time each company has sweetened its bid for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> fell 50 cents a share to close at $ 67.62 -LCB- Friday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. In recommending that shareholders tender to Odyssey, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said its board had considered and rejected <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s competing offer. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, had said in an interview he considered <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s current bid fair, but he did not rule out another round of bidding. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> had no comment on what action the company might take. The board's decision to spurn <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> came after the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, company was able to remove major antitrust concerns by agreeing with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to sell certain <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets if its offer succeeds. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> said earlier in the week that the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to permit <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s previously announced plans to sell half of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about $ 170 million to <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the textile manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Bibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> also waived waiting requirements under federal disclosure laws but could require <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> to sell a sheeting mill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name if the deal were consummated, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Stock prices pulled out of Thursday's steep slide with an uneven showing Friday marked by strength in some blue-chip issues. But analysts said investors' spirits were still dampened by worries over inflation and the nation's international trade problems. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 101.46 on Thursday for its fifth largest point loss ever, rose 8.29 to 2,013.93. It finished the week with a net loss of 76.26 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in the daily tally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 573 up, 990 down and 420 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 234.16 million shares, up from 211.81 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index slipped .14 to 147.00. Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some buying by traders looking for `` bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday. But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles in any bid to rebound. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday morning that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of inflationary pressures. At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets, pushing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds close to the 8.95 percent level. Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade deficit widened in February. Gainers among the blue chips that contributed to the Dow Jones industrials' gain included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up 2 -RCB- at 114 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -RCB- at 48 | Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> reported a first-quarter earnings gain that drew high marks from most analysts. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection, voted a 75-cents-a-share quarterly dividend and expanded the plans for its restructuring program.

 The biggest rise in wholesale prices in 11 months sent new inflation jitters through the financial markets Friday, but stock prices stabilized a day after a $ 100 billion drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.29 points to 2,013.93 after plunging 101.46 points on Thursday. Stocks also dipped in foreign markets and interest rates rose, but the dollar stabilized. In spite of the Dow Jones increase, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 9 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> raised inflation worries with its report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March, an annual rate for wholesale inflation of more than 7 percent. Investors had already been worried about inflation because of Thursday's report that the merchandise trade deficit jumped unexpectedly to $ 13.8 billion in February. The big trade gap signaled to some investors that an overheated economy was sucking in too many imports. The report also threatened to fuel inflation by knocking down the dollar, which would boost import prices. In spite of the wholesale inflation report, the fear that drove prices down Thursday was largely absent from the markets on Friday. `` There's a bit of concern in the producer price number but not anything great,'' said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Investors realized that the big jumps in food and energy costs that swelled the index in March were probably only temporary, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Interest rates rose Friday as traders speculated the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would try to wring inflation expectations out of the market by tightening credit and slowing down the economy. Tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would push up interest rates in the short term but pave the way for them to decline over the longer term by easing fears of an overheated economy. Some economists worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would accidentally knock the economy into recession by trying too hard to cool things off. `` What's absolutely amazing to me is that last fall all the experts were looking for recession and depression, and that was bad. Here, 180 days later, a strong economy is -LRB- seen as -RRB- bad,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Eigen </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money management firm. The yield of the benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond continued to rise to 8.94 percent by midafternoon Friday, a new three-month high, up from 8.86 percent Thursday. The dollar bobbed within a narrow range after falling 2 percent Thursday against the Japanese yen, West German mark and British pound. Traders said major central banks bought dollars to support the currency for a second day. Overseas Friday, key indexes fell less than 1 percent on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchanges. The Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation that February's trade news would be favorable. The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks fell by $ 99.7 billion in Thursday's plunge, according to a 5,000-stock index measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Stocks fell an additional $ 1 billion in Friday, the organization

 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that its board of directors amended a shareholders' rights `` poison pill'' plan to a make it even tougher for a hostile takeover of the media giant. The board also authorized a stock buyout of up to 5 million common shares, four months after it approved the purchase of up to 2 million shares.

More than 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> stock is owned or controlled by directors, officers, employees or founding families. Under the poison pill amendment, shareholders would be able to buy additional common shares at a discount should someone acquire up to 20 percent of the company's outstanding stock, said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. `` The effect of that is to make a hostile takeover attempt extremely dilutive,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soybeans Plunge On Poor Export Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices plunged as much as 16 cents a bushel Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid heavy selling prompted by a dismal outlook for export sales, analysts said. Grain futures also retreated. On other markets, cattle futures finished higher after reversing sharp losses; pork futures moved lower; oil futures advanced for the fifth straight day; precious metals and stock-index futures posted slight gains. Soybeans declined on a combination of bearish fundamentals, including good harvest weather for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop, disappointing export sales last week and relatively high cash prices for soybeans and soybean products, analysts said. `` We're just way out of whack with prices for cottonseed meal and corn,'' making soybeans less attractive on the world market, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The government released grain export sales figures Thursday for the week ending April 7, showing shipments of both soybeans and soybean meal were down about 60 percent from the previous week. The rally last week that pushed new-crop soybean futures well above $ 7 a bushel likely persuaded more farmers to plant soybeans, another bearish factor, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said Chicago-based C & amp; D Commodities, the largest speculative firm on the floor, led the decline by selling large numbers of contracts for soybeans and soybean products that it had purchased in recent weeks Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.12 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.02 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.60 a bushel; soybeans were 13 cents to 16 cents lower with May at $ 6.62 -LCB- a bushel. Cattle futures rode a roller coaster on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for April delivery falling to 72.50 cents a pound, then rallying to settle at 73.97 cents, 15 points above Thursday's settlement. Traders were counting on Friday's lower wholesale beef prices and forecasts for warmer weather to spark a resurgence of retail buying for outdoor cookouts, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The abiltiy of the market to shake off its early severe losses today indicated anticipation of better retail business next week,'' he said. The lower prices for pork futures reflected concerns about the week's unusually high slaughter numbers, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. `` There is no sign of a seasonal letup in supplies,'' he said. `` Until we start to see the marketings subside, the market will struggle with the large production.'' Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .37 cent higher with April at 73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 79.67 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent lower to .07 cent higher with April at 44.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at 52.05 cents a pound. Crude-oil futures advanced for the fifth straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC countries will agree to limit oil production when they meet in a session tentatively scheduled for April 26. Some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> appear unwilling to cut their production, but the market has so far ignored those bearish signals, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, senior oil analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 8 cents higher with May at $ 18.37 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .43 cent higher with May at 49.75 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .25 cent to .33 cent higher with May at 52.61 cents a gallon. Gold futures advanced on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in quiet trading following the government's release of a report showing a 0.6 percent rise in wholesale prices last month. Silver was nearly unchanged. The market was expecting an increase of about 0.3 percent in wholesale prices, and analysts had expected the inflationary implications of a greater rise to send gold prices soaring. Gold settled $ 1.90 to $ 2.80 higher with June at $ 458.50 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1 cent higher with May at $ 6.475 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures posted slight gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 0.4 point higher at 258.80.

 Bond prices tumbled and interest rates jumped Friday for the second consecutive session as new worries emerged about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond fell | point, or $ 6.25 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, climbed to 8.94 percent from 8.86 percent late Thursday. The 30-year bond dropped about $ 10 for every $ 1,000 in face value moments after the government reported wholesale prices jumped 0.6 percent in March _ the biggest increase in 11 months. But prices later recoverered as buyers appeared when yields on the longest issues edged closer to 9 percent, a height last touched in January. The latest price decline came on the heels of Thursday's sharp slide in stock and bond prices sparked by news of an unexpected widening in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. Most analysts had been looking for a more moderate gain in wholesale prices than the 0.6 percent rise reported by the government. `` It catered to the market's recent fears about whether the economy is expanding too rapidly, and is facing demand pressures and bottlenecks that would tend to move prices higher,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of money market research for the investment fir <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, and increases the chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will encourage higher interest rates to curb rising prices In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term issues fell -LRB- point, intermediates lost 5-16 point and 20-year governments fell -RCB- point, according to the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, had declined 0.42 to 110.83. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> composite index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 3.76 at 1,159.06. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.98 to 278.90. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, soared 17 basis points to 5.89 percent, while six-month bills jumped 19 basis points to 6.22 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. One-year bills jumped 12 basis points to 6.58 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 6 -RCB- percent, up from 611-16 percent late Thursday. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index of 40 long-term bonds fell 11-32 point to 8718-32 while its yield rose to 8.21 percent from 8.17 percent.

 World finance leaders wrapped up a tumultuous meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on Friday with more words of assurance to nervous financial markets and further efforts to rescue the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The semi-annual meeting of the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> was dominated by the dollar's steep plunge after four months of relative stability. In an effort to brake the nosedive, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies launched a multimillion-dollar intervention effort, selling off their reserves of Japanese yen, German marks and other currencies and buying dollars. The intervention, while doing little to slow the dollar's descent on Thursday, met with more success on Friday amid reports of further dollar purchases by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> The dollar declined against the yen on markets in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but rallied later in the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading to close at 123.8 yen, up from 123.7 yen late Thursday. Still, the dollar's rout shattered the optimistic tone the finance ministers had hoped to impart in their first high-level discussions since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. The dollar's plunge came less than 18 hours after the world's seven largest industrial economies _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ had issued a glowing appraisal of the world economy The so-called Group of Seven bragged in a joint communique Wednesday that they had successfully stabilized the dollar since pledging to do so on Dec. 22 and reaffirmed their commitment to intervene in currency markets when necessary to keep the dollar stable. Instead of focusing on the words of optimism, financial markets the next day were stampeded into a frantic dollar selloff following news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to a disappointing $ 13.8 billion in February. Administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> held a hasty 10-minute conference with finance ministers from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> to discuss the dollar selloff. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have supplied the largest amount of reserves to buy dollars. Currency traders estimated that on Thursday alone the amount of intervention totaled as much as $ 700 million. Sources said the intervention continued Friday. Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told reporters he found it encouraging that the markets had settled down somewhat on Friday following the intervention effort, which he termed a success. `` I think the reaction Thursday was one of surprise, but we all realize that the trade figures are erratic and as people reflected on that, things calmed down,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Dutch Finance Minister <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s policymaking committee, said the market turmoil came up in the discussions, but he said that there was no undue concern `` Members were aware of the development in the markets -LRB- during their closed-door session Thursday -RRB-, but it has not changed dramatically the actions of our meetings,'' <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON> said. `` We are trying to improve the -LRB- world economic -RRB- system regardless of the vagaries of the market from day to day.'' <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON> said the finance ministers decided against making any alterations in their assessment of global growth prospects. The group's final communique on Friday predicted continued growth for the world economy this year at a `` steady, moderate'' pace. The joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> also addressed Third World debt problems, although no major new initiatives were unveiled. World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, in a speech Friday, said the overriding issue facing the two lending organizations was the need to reduce the poor countries' debt burden, which is estimated to total $ 1.245 trillion at the end of this year. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, British chancellor of the exchequer, said one thing that would help would be a reduction in the interest rates the poor countries are being charged on their loans. `` All of us know that there is no way in which the poorest countries can meet their interest payments,'' he said. `` The interest burden thus mounts exponentially and the poorest countries are thus caught in a vicious circle.''

<HEAD>Mill Closed, 400 Laid Off; Company Suspects Sabotage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has suspended operations at its pulp and paper mill here and temporarily laid off 400 employees while repairs are made to equipment that company officials said Friday may have been sabotaged. The closing follows a weeklong shutdown at a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> mill in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> because of what the company also termed apparent acts of sabotage. Labor leaders have denied union involvment in the incidents at both mills. The Woodland mill was shut down Thursday after a maintenance employee discovered two pounds of sand blasting shot in the gear box and lube system of a paper pulp washer in the bleaching plant, mill manager <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` The machine has just been destroyed,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoffmann </PERSON> said from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` If we ca n't make bleached pulp, we ca n't make any paper. And we ca n't make any bleached pulp. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the mill would remain closed and the 400 hourly workers laid off indefinitely while the washer is repaired and an investigation conducted into other areas of the mill. Company officials said the pulp washer was `` apparently sabotaged,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> detectives have been called in to conduct a criminal investigation, Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whynott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zoffmann </PERSON> said she did not know who might have tampered with the equipment, which was located in an area accessible to all employees. She also declined to say if the incident was related to stalled contract negotiations. There is `` no evidence to indicate that it is,'' she said. `` I guess it would be speculation'' to say the union was involved. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinardo </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said he did not believe union members were responsible. `` The international does not condone anything like sabotage,'' he said. `` And I do n't believe the company has proof of anything like that.'' Labor negotiations, under way since July between <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> UPIU </ORGANIZATION> and several smaller trade unions, have been stalled and no date has been set to resume the talks. The unions have been working without a contract since August. Among the sticking points are the union's demands for premium pay on Sundays, as well as the company's desire for more flexibility in assigning jobs and the opportunity to keep the mill open on holidays. Management of the pension fund has also been an issue. This is not the first time equipment has been damaged at the mill and the cause attributed to sabotage. In September, another machine in the bleaching plant was found damaged during a regularly scheduled maintenance shutdown. <PERSON> Zoffmann </PERSON> said no one was found at fault in that incident and the investigation is continuing. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> paper mill in <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> was shut down April 6-13 because of what the company termed apparent acts of sabotage. <PERSON> Zoffmann </PERSON> said 185 workers, including 140 union employees, were sent home while police began an investigation into the dumping of dye in a vat of wallpaper stock. Police also are investigating an April 3 fire that damaged a garage and two vehicles at the <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, home of the <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> mill's personnel manager. Workers at the <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> mill have been without a contract for six months and authorities in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> have questioned whether the incidents are labor-related. Union members have emphatically denied any connection.

<HEAD>Former Xerox Employees Charge Age Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawyers for some 1,300 former <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees, claiming they lost their jobs because of age discrimination, asked a federal appeals court Friday to allow them to sue for damages in a class action. The case has bounced around the federal court system for five years and now it has bounced back to the Third U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, where two judges said they were troubled that a lower court, without considering statistical evidence, had decertified a class of victims of an alleged pattern or practice of age discrimination. According to briefs filed in the case, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> terminated, forced to retire or denied promotion to at least 1,300 people between May 1980 and April 1983 in order to reduce its work force. The lower court held they were not part of a class action because they had different jobs and different risks. `` That is error,'' said Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, representing 13 former salesmen of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> facsimile devices who brought the appeal seeking to reinstate a 1984 order by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that had created a conditional class. After nearly an hour of oral argument, Judges <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scirica </PERSON> took the case under advisement. A decision is not expected until sometime this summer. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, another lawyer representing the employees, said: `` We are fighting the procedural barriers erected by a well-financed firm who have consistently denied that the reduction in force imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> targeted older workers even though the evidence we provided conclusively supports it.'' `` You say the lower court failed to consider the statistical evidence, or even company documents -LRB- that supported it -RRB-, when it denied a class action designation?'' asked <PERSON> Rosenn </PERSON>. `` Right,'' responded <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. `` We ask you to instruct the trial court to consider that. We say <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> conducted fraud on its older workers. The undisputed facts of discrimination come from the company's own records. What the lower court did was a clear error of law.'' Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufo </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed, and contended that charges of discrimination must be proved, separately, by each claimant. <PERSON> Rosenn </PERSON> interjected that `` what troubles me is that in the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opinion there is no discussion of the evidence.'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said he, too, `` was troubled -LRB- because the judge -RRB- didn ` t say what he found, and that appears to be clear error.'' <PERSON> Rosenn </PERSON> added, `` He ignored the statistical evidence, and said it was n't relevant. Should he have disregarded it? That's what we have to decide.'' <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufo </PERSON> argued that `` the statistical evidence is wrong, and is irrelevant.'' The federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in a friend of the court brief, noted: `` It is difficult to prove specific acts of discrimination'' and that `` statistics may often be the only available evidence of clandestine and covert discrimination.'' It joined the plaintiffs in asking that the class be certified contending that the lower court `` committed legal error.''

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said in a television interview after the October stock market crash that his job as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman had taught him the value of truthfulness. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as vice president of communications last year after his departure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, resigned Friday because of an uproar over his disclosure that he had invented quotes for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

He was responding to a question about post-crash <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> advertisements, which had been criticized as overly optimistic about the outlook for stocks.

<HEAD>Union Says FAA Safety Checks Sideline 10 Eastern Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> planes sidelined with safety violations grew to at least 10 Friday, as a federal crackdown found problems including a fuel leak, a missing maintenance log and a cracked wing flap, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union said. The airline and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm the number, saying they have stopped detailing the violations. `` They did n't want to see a running box score,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. `` We'll summerize it at the end of the inspection.'' Four more planes were found to have safety violations Friday, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They're calling in from around the country,'' the official said of machinists supplying their union with information after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> stopped making it public. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> put out a bulletin to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 12,000 machinists urging them to report thoroughly on threats some employees have said they received from management after they spoke voluntarily with <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors. The latest temporary groundings were in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the unidentified union official said. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Flight 945, an A-300 <ORGANIZATION> AirBus </ORGANIZATION>, was sidelined at 9 a.m. EDT Friday with a wing flap dent and a fuel leak in an engine. The plane was fixed by 12:30 p.m., the official said. A second <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> flight was held for repairs Friday morning, the official said. Flight 465, a 727 to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, was found to have a cracked wing flap. Late Thursday, Flight 267, a DC-9 bound for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was taken out of service after <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors found it lacked a flight maintenance log and was missing landing bumper pads. The battery relay switch on a DC-9 was found not to be working in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. The switch turns on the plane's electrical equipment, the official said. The tenth plane was a DC-9 taken out of service when inspectors discovered a duct in the tail section was overheating, the official said. The four Friday groundings were in addition to six the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reported on Thursday. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said about 20 percent of the EAL 267-plane fleet had been looked over by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors in 23 cities when the agency stopped reporting its findings Friday morning. Inspections were expected to continue as flights arrived in those cities during the 30-day review that began Wednesday. Eastern officials have refused to reveal the number of safety violations found in their fleet. Eastern spokewoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said news of the sidelined planes was being overblown. She noted that some of mechanical problems occurred daily and were fixed. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis-Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> flight that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had cleared for takeoff was emptied of passengers and sidelined Thursday because of a fuel leak, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. In addition to the planes stopped Friday, the <LOCATION> Minneapolis-Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> flights, DC-9s and 727s were sidelined in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y. The inspection of all Eastern planes began after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> slapped the company with a $ 823,000 fine for safety violations. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said officials have been unsatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s performance since its 1986 takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also will undergo a 30-day inspection of its operating practices.

<HEAD>Closing Arguments Heard In West Publishing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two computerized legal research services squared off in federal court Friday for closing arguments in a two-week copyright infringement trial a defense lawyer called a case of `` the emperor's new clothes.'' <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> filed suit against one of its competitors in 1985, alleging copyright infringement. West, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, accused <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> of illegally using West's copyright material in Lexis, their computerized legal research service <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes Lexis, is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a paper products manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` A case of the ` emperor's new clothes' is how I referred to this in my opening statement,'' <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> told the court. `` The arrangements in this case are nothing more than legal finery which have been rigged up by some tailor.'' Last year, <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> sued West, claiming that West is an illegal monopoly. West also has filed an antitrust suit against <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, bringing to three the number of lawsuits in which the two are engaged. The copyright infringement trial, heard by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, is part of an 11-count complaint. The remaining 10 counts will be resolved by judicial order once <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> issues his ruling on the copyright issue. West's National Reporter System publishes judicial opinions for every state and federal court, and the company's Key Number Index System organizes and classifies case law. West asks that <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> be permanently enjoined from continuing to copy <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s materials and that the court impound and destroy all infringing materials. `` <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> took -LRB- our materials -RRB-. They knew it. And they expected to derive great revenue from it,'' West lawyer <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Opperman </PERSON> argued. `` We have both the right to copy and the right to display. Both have been infringed.'' But <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> claims there's been no infringement because West is not entitled to a copyright. `` In no case does copyright protection from an original work or authority extend to an idea ... And if we have anything here, all we have is an idea or concept,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> only wanted to make `` fair use'' of the materials and should have access to them. `` West, I submit, confused access to the law with access to West books ... But West does n't own the law,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Opperman </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s system reflects originality and is therefore protected by copyright. `` This is the product of great intellectual effort, great creativity,'' <PERSON> Opperman </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge Friday blocked investors led by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> from proceeding with a $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but the judge left the door open for <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> to salvage the proposed deal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said that the novel role played by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the takeover apparently requires the investment banking firm to file financial disclosure statements just like any other bidder. <PERSON> Shearson </PERSON> did not make the filings. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said that `` since ... there is a great probability that the defendants have violated the Williams Act,'' he was suspending the takeover until a trial can be held or the violations in the $ 60-per-share tender offer are corrected. The Williams Act is intended to prevent manipulation of the stock markets. The Beazer group did not immediately indicate whether it would appeal <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON>'s order or attempt to correct the technical defects and continue soliciting shares. The tender offer was due to expire at midnight Friday, but the suitors are expected to extend the offer during the weekend. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> wants to combine his British and American holdings in construction and building materials with the Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer of building materials and chemicals. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> maintained that its partial ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover company, <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is merely an extension of traditional lending practices in corporate acquisitions `` The Shearson interests appear to be somewhat stealthily pioneering the brave new world of equity financing,'' the judge said in his 95-page opinion and order. `` As the legendary camel once got his nose in the tent, intending to follow with its entire body, so Shearson seems to be pursuing an agenda of its own.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s new approach prompted members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to propose legislation against the takeover and to call for investigations. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said, `` this is a difficult case'' made all the more complex by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s `` quite novel'' role as `` broker-dealer-investment banker-adviser-owner. `` The facts are intricate and complicated; the law is fuzzy,'' he said. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to borrow $ 864 million from a bank syndicate led by <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> likely violate <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rules about posting stock as collateral on loans used to buy the stock. The order is the second against the tender offer in a federal court. A judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has blocked it on antitrust grounds. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuirt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments May 13 on <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to overturn the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemical operations stoked fears of losing 1,100 jobs in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said the takeover should be halted for now because `` the potential ramifications ... to the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> community are uncertain and possibly adverse.'' In a countersuit, the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group said <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>'s filings in response to the tender offer also violated securities laws. But <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said the tender offer apparently `` is invalid under federal securities laws'' and `` until ... a valid tender offer is made, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> is not obligated'' to file the proper disclosures.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received at least $ 2.2 million for 1987 in salary, exercised stock options and stock grants, the nation's largest automaker reported Friday in its proxy statement <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received $ 867,000 in salary, earned $ 513,121 exercising stock options and was awarded a stock bonus worth $ 800,000 when it was granted on Dec. 7. The stock, issued in blocks over a three-year period that began in January, is worth considerably more now. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> received at least $ 1.2 million for 1987: $ 517,000 in salary, $ 73,523 on exercised stock options and $ 600,000 in the stock bonus. <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> became president in August, when he replaced the retired <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. In all, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 13.6 million in 1987 salaries to its top 58 executives and gave stock awards worth $ 16.2 million on Dec. 7 and $ 21.1 million on Friday to 4,961 executives. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 automaker, paid $ 247.9 million in bonuses for 1987 to 5,166 executives, it reported in a proxy statement mailed Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> earned nearly $ 11 million in 1987: $ 808,697 in salary, $ 2 million in cash bonuses and nearly $ 8.1 million on exercised stock options. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, who exercised no stock options, received $ 2.8 million in cash bonuses and $ 929,934 in salary. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose to $ 3.6 billion in 1987 from $ 2.95 billion in 1986, but for the second year in a row it earned too little on its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaking business to pay profit-sharing to its 350,000 hourly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers. The outcry over the millions of dollars executives received in bonuses for 1986 prompted <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors in 1987 to switch to an all-stock bonus and spread each stock grant over several years. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON> said the 1987 compensation received by top <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> executives `` still ca n't be justified rationally and constitutes an insult to common sense and fairness.'' During a time when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s automaking business is earning so little, they said in a statement, `` we will leave the executives to forego all increases and supplementary awards in the spirit of shared sacrifice.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> distributed a record $ 636 million in profit-sharing checks in March to more than 156,000 hourly and salaried employees, an average of more than $ 4,000 each. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock closed at $ 72.75 a share, up from $ 71.62 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Class E stock, based on earnings of its <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, declined to $ 41 a share from $ 41.62 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Class H stock, based on earnings of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, closed at $ 30.25 a share, up from $ 30. When the stock bonuses were granted Dec. 7, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> common stock was worth $ 56.19 a share, Class E stock was worth $ 31.19 a share and Class H stock was worth $ 23.22 a share.
