<HEAD>A Nightmare Come True _ Massacre in a College Classroom</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Canada-Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was a nightmare come true Wednesday afternoon _ a crowded classroom at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> engineering building and a rifleman in hunting clothes picking out his victims before firing. By the time the gunman killed himself, he had shot 14 women to death and wounded 12 others. Six women were shot to death in the first classroom he entered and a seventh in another room. Then the man prowled the halls, killing three women in the cafeteria and four more women in the corridor of the third floor, where he then shot himself. Witnesses described the scene in the first classroom, at the beginning of the massacre: `` I was doing a presentation in front of the class and suddenly a guy came in with what I think was a semi-automatic rifle,'' engineering student <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavarie </PERSON> said. `` He told us to stop everything. `` And then when we looked at him we thought it was a joke, but he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two groups, the guys in one corner and the girls in -LRB- another -RRB- corner. `` When that was done, he asked the guys to leave. He left the girls in there. `` We got outside in the hallway and for a couple of minutes he stayed in there and after, when we got out, he leveled his gun at a group of people who were there and he shot three or four shots.'' <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 25, a student in the classroom, said, `` He told the guys to move to one side and the girls to the other. Nobody moved. We thought it was a joke. It was our last hour of the term. We practically laughed. `` I thought it was a blank,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, who was close to a classropm wall at which the gunman fired. `` I did n't see anything on the wall. But it made a very loud noise. `` When he came in he was really calm but after the first shot his voice became nervous.'' Professor <PERSON> Yvon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON>, who taught the mechanical engineering course, was sitting at his desk listening to the student presentation when the gunman entered. `` I did n't see him walk in. When I saw him, he was two or three feet from the students presenting their project,'' <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said. `` Then he asked all the men to go one one side of the room and the women on the other. `` Nobody moved. We thought it was a joke. `` It does n't make sense.'' Student <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauthier </PERSON>, 24, left the classroom about 5 p.m. The gunman entered, carrying an object that looked like a rifle in a trash bag. `` I went to the bathroom and when I came back, people were running out, screaming, ` There's a crazy guy in there! He's shot people!,' <PERSON> Gauthier </PERSON> said. `` I went to get my things and saw there was blood in front of the photocopy machine. `` Someone told me the first person he shot when he came out of the classroom was a girl in front of the photocopy machine.'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordeleau </PERSON>, a student who ran from the first to the second floor, said he dragged people by the collar to keep them from going downstairs to see the gunman. Student <PERSON> Vanthona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouy </PERSON>, 22, tore the sleeve on his coat as he fled the building. `` I saw death up close and I shook. I dropped everything and ran,'' he said. Student <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said: `` I was in the stairwell and someone came up the stairs shouting, ` Watch out! Watch out! He's coming!' I thought he was joking.'' <PERSON> Yannick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacoste </PERSON>, a student who had just left the school library when she heard about five consecutive gunshots in the hallways, said, `` People were yelling, ` Someone is firing!' and students were running through the halls. `` I hurried to the door. I was very nervous. You do n't know if the shots are aimed at you.''

 A truck bomb containing a half-ton of dynamite exploded outside secret police headquarters during the morning rush hour Wednesday, killing at least 35 people and wounding hundreds. The bomb, presumably the work of drug gangs, was the most powerful to strike the capital since <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine traffickers began a wave of terror after the government declared war on them 16 weeks ago. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told Colombians they face an escalation in drug-related violence. Late Wednesday, three bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the hub of a major cocaine-trafficking cartel, a police spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from the city. He said they went off at an electronics shop, a Morman temple and an evangelical church without injuring anyone. Police also deactivated a car bomb a block from the offices of dozens of judges in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Wednesday afternoon, the national police said. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said late Wednesday in a nationally televised speech that drug traffickers had begun a new wave of terrorism intended to stop extradition of suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to destroy Colombian democracy. `` We must not, we will not ever fall before the drug traffickers,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said in the speech broadcast by radio and television from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where he was on a state visit. `` The stable democracy that we have built with great effort and defended for more than a century is in danger.'' The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> blast, which tore open a crater 20 feet deep and destroyed or heavily damaged a score of buildings, occurred less than 24 hours after government investigators said a bomb caused the crash of a Colombian jetliner last month that killed 107 people. No one claimed responsibility directly for Wednesday's explosion, but Gen. <PERSON> Faruk </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police chief, said it was undoubtedly the work of drug traffickers A statement from the so-called Extraditables delivered to newspapers and radio stations in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, said: `` We will stop the war only when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> understands the people must be our judge.'' The reference was to a bill that would permit a national referendum on extraditing drug trafficking suspects wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The House of Representatives approved it Tuesday night. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government opposes the measure, contending the drug barons would step up terrorism before a referendum to frighten voters into rejecting extradition. In his comments, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> blamed traffickers for the bombing of the jetliner last month, for Tuesday's assassination of a judge in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, and for the bombing of the secret police headquarters. He said the three attacks represent `` a vile assault'' by the traffickers. `` These incidents show that what these criminals are capable of as they make sure that the referendum results are in their favor,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said, who was scheduled to return from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Friday. In their statement, the Extraditables said: `` The president should not fear what the congress decides, because the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> is the voice of the people, and the voice of the people is the voice of God.'' Minister of Government <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> told reporters after the bombing: `` The slaughter that we warned of when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved extradition in the plebiscite has started.'' He is acting president while <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> is on the state visit. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> bomb went off at 7:30 a.m. in an area crowded with people bound for work on foot and in cars. So powerful was the explosion that it broke windows in a building across the street from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy seven miles away. <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> quoted sources with explosives experts at the scene as saying the truck was packed with 1,100 pounds of dynamite. Reports on the number of dead and wounded varied, and rescuers were pulling bodies from the rubble of buildings hours after the blast. Health Minister <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said in an interview with <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> that at least 35 people were killed, 250 seriously wounded and 750 treated for cuts, abrasions, shock and shock. Unconfirmed reports gave higher death tolls. However, the television news program `` 24 Hours'' reported the death toll rose to 40 late Wednesday. Police said they were unable to confirm that report. The explosion blew the facade off the secret police headquarters and destroyed virtually all its walls and windows. Also heavily damaged were an office building for federal judges across the street and the national transit police headquarters a block away. Half a dozen stores across the street from secret police headquarters were reduced to smoking rubble and about 60 cars were destroyed. Visa renewal is one function of the secret police, or Department of Administrative Security. Many foreigners usually are there on any given weekday, but it was not known whether foreigners were among the dead and wounded. This is a busy season because many foreigners go home for Christmas, and can not do so without reports of clean police records. Minutes after the explosion, detectives at secret police headquarters scrambled up ladders and, from the remains of cells, pulled two stunned prisoners awaiting extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prisoners were taken away in an armored vehicle. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> said on Caracol the bombing illustrated the futility of trying to negotiate with the drug gangs. He said the government would not lessen its resolve to crush them. In their statement about the second bomb in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the national police said the device was hidden in a subcompact <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> parked in front of a government building where dozens of judges have their offices. The police did not say how much dynamite was in the car. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> began the war on traffickers hours after they assassinated a leading presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, on Aug. 16 during a campaign speech in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. He also reinstated extradition of suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which was suspended by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings in 1987 and 1988. Nine have been sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the past three months. An <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet exploded in the air Nov. 27 and all 107 people aboard were killed. The government Tuesday said a bomb caused the explosion. Not counting the plane crash victims or the victims of Wednesday's truck bomb, 29 people have been killed and 238 wounded by 201 bombs since <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s assassination.

<HEAD>Officials Say Military Growth To Continue Despite Global Peace Trend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defense budget, already judged the third largest in the world, will continue to grow even as the superpowers talk about cutting back on military spending, officials say. In a region so far immune to dramatic improvements in relations like those occurring in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has at best cool relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the two countries are deadlocked over an old territorial dispute. And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to increase its budgetary support for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military budget, always controversial in light of a constitution that bans war, has grown steadily through the 1980s to increase the country's ability to fend off Soviet attack. `` It is separate from -LRB- superpower -RRB- arms reductions from that point of view. So our own efforts for improving our self-defense are not expected to change at the moment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday. He was asked if the outcome of the superpower summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, which gave new impetus to arms negotiations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, would reduce <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military spending. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is starting to plan for defense cuts, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> says the Soviets have reduced military spending. Japanese newspapers reported today that <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON>, vice minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, had cautioned the public against thinking that the superpower summit could result in a cutback in this country's defense budget. And an anonymous Foreign Ministry official was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> daily as saying, `` The Asian situation is completely different from that of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and still remains unstable. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> needs to develop a minimum defense strength for deterrence.'' Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that the defense budget would grow a hefty 6 percent in the fiscal year that begins in April, to about $ 27.8 billion, or roughly 1 percent of gross national product. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget is more than 10 times as large and consumes 6 percent of gross national product. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defense spending has grown rapidly in dollar terms due to the yen's almost doubling in value since 1985, and now is judged third-biggest in the world or slightly ahead of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Much of the defense buildup took place in close coordination with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which by treaty is obliged to help defend <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The two countries' navies and air forces collaborate on defense planning, and the Japanese have been building up potent air and anti-submarine forces. Unlike Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with its fairly clear divide between two superpower camps on the ground, the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a vast area in which control of the sea is a more important factor, and there are more contenders: the Soviets, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the U.S.-Japan alliance, and powerful smaller countries like <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the Koreas. The <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, however, have bitter memories of Japanese invasions, and have protested <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s increases in military spending. After World War II, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities imposed a constutition that bans the use of military force, and the armed forces have an ambiguous status. Their existence is justified as strictly for self-defense, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has not acquired hardware that would enable distant military adventures, such as long-range bombers or aircraft carriers. But some Americans have called for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase defense efforts even more to relieve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military outlay. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently signed a bill calling on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to pay all the costs of the roughly 50,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now pays about 45 percent of the support, or about $ 2.8 billion a year. The Japanese government has not yet commented on the new call from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

Though claiming to be disturbed by the unceasing attention since the prize was announced Oct. 18, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said he was coming to receive the Nobel `` with gratitude and emotion.'' `` But I'm looking forward to being able to sit at my desk and start working again,'' he said. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> will be given his award by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> on Sunday, and a check for the equivalent of $ 469,000. The writer dismissed the idea he would now `` rest on his laurels'' after receiving one of the world's most coveted literary awards. `` I ca n't imagine a retrospective future,'' he said. Asked who inspired him the most, <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said, `` I was inspired by all Spanish authors before me. Literature is part of a culture.'' He said he best enjoyed reading medieval <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> poets. He also mentioned the late <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> as an influence. `` <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> was my friend. We went to a lot of bullfights together. He was a great author and a great friend,'' <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> drew on his experiences in the Spanish Civil War for many of his stories, which often showed the violent and gruesome side of life.

<HEAD>NEA, Urban Schools Seek Input Into National Education Goals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As the nation's governors try to meet a self-imposed deadline for developing national education goals, leaders of education groups are moving to have some impact on the finished product. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, proposed Tuesday that federally financed preschool programs for poor youngsters integrate nutrition, prenatal care and health screening. Early childhood education should be the primary focus of the nation, <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said in an interview two days before Thursday's meeting of the Education Task Force of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, And while preschool was included in its recommendations, a second education group, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, said the first priority should be to improve urban The council said 30.4 percent of all poor children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are enrolled in only 50 urban school systems and the teacher shortage in urban schools is 2 -LCB- times greater than the national average. <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> and council leaders _ President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zenke </PERSON> and Director <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Husk </PERSON> _ will present their ideas on national performance goals for education at the task force meeting. The governors' group has been working since the idea was approved in September at the education summit between governors and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. All 50 governors will convene in late February to put on the finishing touches. In a Dec. 1 letter to the task force co-chairmen, <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> suggested the goals `` be both ambitious and specific: ambitious enough to demonstrate that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leaders understand the depth of the problems schools face, specific enough to enable Americans to hold government accountable.'' <PERSON> Husk </PERSON> said the council's board of directors decided in early November to strongly recommend that national goals contain specific targets, outcomes and measures from each area; interim goals to be met along the way; program and funding strategies at all levels and plans for incentives and accountability. The Council of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> is an organization of 45 urban school districts that concentrates on the concerns of city schools. `` Urban educators have proven their ability to improve our schools with limited resources, however, the time has come for governments, businesses and our communities to provide the monetary resources to support efforts to fulfill our commitment to quality education for all children,'' <PERSON> Husk </PERSON> said. `` No child should be allowed to fall through the cracks,'' <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said. `` Every child should arrive at school physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially able to learn.'' Head Start has been touted as the most successful preschool program financed by the federal government. About 1,300 Head Start programs operate around the country, providing education and health and nutrition services to about 20 percent of the impoverished preschoolers who are eligible. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently signed a law to increase spending for the Head Start program this fiscal year by $ 147 million to $ 1.6 billion. But the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> estimated about $ 6.3 billion is needed to serve all eligible children ages 3 through 5. Both the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and council offered similar proposals they want incorporated into the national performance goals. For example, both called for safe, disciplined and drug-free schools. The council also suggested there should be specific steps to be taken by distillers, tobacco and firearms manufacturers to reduce youth access to their products. The groups also called for a reduction in the dropout rate. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> proposed providing a fully qualified teacher for every classroom, with salaries and benefits competitive with other fields that require comparable skills, preparation and responsibility. The council suggested the goals target specific number or percentages of teachers needed by 2000 to better reflect the racial characteristics of students.

<HEAD>Analysts: Farmers Will Be in the Market for New Machinery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A relatively high level of cash income is expected to put more farmers in the 1990 market for new machinery and other capital improvements, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts say. Net cash income is expected to be in the range of $ 52 billion to $ 54 billion this year, down from a record $ 59.9 billion in 1988 because of higher production expenses and lower government payments. In 1990, according to projections announced at the department's recent outlook conference, net cash income _ the difference between cash gross income and cash expenses _ may be in the range of $ 52 billion to $ 57 billion <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that with 1990 net cash income looking brighter and interest rates to remain near current levels, capital spending next year could rise 4 percent to 5 percent. `` Prospects for increased planted acreage and an aging farm machinery stock may also positively influence capital spending by farmers,'' he said. A seven-year slump for the farm machinery industry ended in 1986. `` Unit sales of new farm tractors and other large pieces of farm equipment increased in 1987 and 1988 and are likely to show further gains in 1989 and 1990,'' <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON> said. `` Sales of new over-40-horsepower tractors may reach 64,000 units, up from an estimated 62,000 in 1989.'' <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON> said combines did not substantially rebound until this year because some farmers had to postpone capital spending because of the 1988 drought. Even so, self-propelled combine sales, which are closely related to harvest prospects, `` began to rise significantly'' from 1988 levels by April of this year. The retooling of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture is long overdue. Between 1980 and 1986, he said, capital expenditures dropped by nearly 60 percent. `` Rising real interest rates, declining commodity prices, curtailed agricultural exports, reluctance to take on additional debt, falling land values, reduced planted cropland and a binge of capital spending in the 1970s led to very conservative levels of capital spending in the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON> said. Tractors and other farm machinery usually make up about 60 percent of all capital expenditures, with buildings and land improvements accounting for 25 percent to 30 percent, and cars and trucks the remainder. Sales of large new tractors were one of the hardest hit categories during the early and mid-1980s, with the number of units sold plummeting 75 percent. <PERSON> Daberkow </PERSON> said farmers may spend between $ 118 billion and $ 121 billion next year on total agricultural supplies, or inputs, which would be down 1 percent to 2 percent from this year. That would be due in part to lower feed costs.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been authorized to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said Tuesday that the wheat will be available to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The subsidies have averaged from around $ 10 per ton, to more than $ 40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 27 cents to about $ 1.10 per bushel. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said 10,000 tons remained in the previous <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> allocation for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced Feb. 27. That allocation was for 2 million tons. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was the largest foreign buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat in the 1988-89 wheat marketing year that ended May 31 with orders for nearly 8.1 million tons, all of it under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program. Sales for 1989-90 total about 4.7 million tons, most of it without subsidies. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is also the world's largest wheat producer this year with an output estimated at 91 million tons. That compares with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s harvest of 89 million tons this year and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of about 56 million tons.

 Imports of lambs and sheep rose sharply this year and are expected to continue rising in 1990, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> livestock analysts.

Traditionally, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> supplies most of the lamb imports, but this year large shipments have been received from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> feedlots. `` With the investment in the facilities and the initial outlook for lamb prices to be marginally above present levels, lambs should continue to be imported next year,'' the agency said in an outlook report.

<TEXT>
 Two liberal voter registration groups that took money from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a central figure in the savings and loan scandal, have seen contributions dry up, officials of the organizations say. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., one of five senators under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, played a role in soliciting money from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for both groups, said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flander </PERSON>, his spokesman One group, The <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, will suspend operations Jan. 1 because the links to <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> have prompted so much turmoil, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffress </PERSON>, the group's lawyer, said Tuesday. `` Given all the proceedings, given the involvement of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, the board thinks it's best they suspend operations on Jan. 1,'' <PERSON> Jeffress </PERSON> said. The other group, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Participation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is not `` actively soliciting resources,'' according to <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynoso </PERSON>, chairman of the board. The center's future will be discussed at the next board meeting, <PERSON> Reynoso </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reynoso </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice and also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s board, said the bad publicity surrounding <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has `` made it very difficult to raise money.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that federal law enforcement authorities are investigating whether both groups violated their tax-exempt status by instructing employees to register more Democrats than Republicans. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> denied that in an interview with the Times, saying voter registration drives were `` carefully done in accordance with legal requirements.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire who headed the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, contributed $ 325,000 over two years to the institute, <PERSON> Jeffress </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> also gave $ 400,000 to the center, a group set up by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, with his father's help, to register new voters in Western states. The Lincoln failure, the subject of numerous federal and state investigations, is expected to cost taxpayers $ 2.5 billion, the largest single thrift collapse. The Forum Institute was created in 1981 by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a philanthropist and paid consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> until October. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> frequently worked in tandem to raise money for voter registration, an issue in which both men were interested, <PERSON> Flander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Flander </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, who has a personal passion for registering new voters, traveled around the country raising money for his cause, including money from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. `` As far as <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> is concerned, this is a good cause,'' <PERSON> Flander </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> first met <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> either in 1985 or 1986. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> sought money from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Participation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and USA Votes, a project of <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dimension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Flander </PERSON> said. New Dimension paid for more than a dozen trips for <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> to travel around the country raising money for voter registration drives in 1988, according to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s financial disclosure forms. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> refused in two telephone conversations to answer any questions about his involvement with <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> or <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. He said he wanted the controversy to subside before he talked about his projects. The non-profit, tax-exempt <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is an organization that `` gives grants to groups that encourage voter participation and public education,'' according to records filed by with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 2.1 million in 1988, about $ 300,000 more than the previous year, the group's <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> records show. Among the grants the institute handed out were a total of roughly $ 305,000 in 1987 and 1988 to the Center for Participation in Democracy. The <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> also gave about $ 800,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a group that trained registrars for the center. Other forum grants went for a variety of projects, ranging from clear air to youth activities. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., are under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee for accepting campaign contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> while at the same time intervening with federal regulators seeking to curb <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> The senators have denied they did anything illegal.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, giving a plug for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as several local shopping malls shut it out this holiday season, said all shopping centers should welcome the annual bell ringers. `` It just would n't be Christmas without that bell ringing,'' the first lady said Tuesday as she dropped $ 10 into the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> kettle inside the entrance to the upscale <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallerie </PERSON> mall. She decided to lend her support when she read a newspaper story about a large number of local shopping malls that are excluding the annual solicitation on the grounds that they bar all groups from soliciting. `` I am a great fan of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, so I wanted to come out and tell you what great work I think you do,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> volunteer <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, commander of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> division. Waters said about a third of the shopping malls in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area bar the annual holiday solicitation by the bell ringers _ about double the rate of refusals in other parts of the country. He said more than 125,000 people came to the local <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for assistance last year, and this year already has seen more requests. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said all shopping malls should allow the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to set up its kettles during the Christmas season. Asked what message she would give to those who refuse, she said she had none but wanted only to praise the ones that do cooperate. `` I'm saying this mall is a great mall,'' she told reporters. `` I ca n't possibly think of Christmas without the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. I ca n't think of disasters without the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said referring to the organization's work for victims of natural disasters. `` I ca n't think of the needy without the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' The organization said that last year it raised $ 600,000 in its kettles throughout the capital region, and about $ 100,00 of that will be lost due to malls that are barring the kettles this year. After stopping at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> kettle, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did some Christmas shopping in <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> department store. She bought toys and clothes for her grandchildren, said her press secretary, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will continue supporting the pro-Moscow leader of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> despite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit that President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s ouster would hasten settlement of the war in that country, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> as `` unacceptable'' to U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, but Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was a national figure who was gaining popularity in the country, the officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were unable to break new ground at their superpower summit to end the conflict between government and Moslem forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> even though the last Soviet troops departed in February. The dispute, which surfaced in an exchange between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky on Sunday, stood in sharp contrast to the mostly positive results of the shipboard meeting. A parallel disagreement over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was disclosed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at a windup news conference Sunday. `` I ca n't say there are no differences between us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters without making any direct reference to the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He stressed their differences over Soviet arms supplies to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insists anti-aircraft missiles and other weapons were being delivered by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he did not know how the arms got to the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that is at war with the Salvadoran government, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at the summit meeting. Regional conflicts have proved to be the most resistant to U.S.-Soviet reconciliation. By contrast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> set as targets arms control accords to limit nuclear, conventional and chemical weapons. <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, the head of the U.S.-backed Afghan resistance, met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House before the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit and said he wanted high-altitude anti-aircraft weapons to use against Soviet bombers. He also expressed hope that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would tell <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to drop Soviet support for the `` puppet regime and the communist government'' in the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, the free world thinks that the Russians have withdrawn completely from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> said. `` Still, the Russians are bombing our people, the mujahedeen, from their own territory.'' The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rolled into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back a Marxist government against Moslem guerrillas in a war that had broken out a year earlier. The last of the Soviet troops were withdrawn in February, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources claim <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s government to $ 300 million to $ 400 million a month. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, at his meeting in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, in September with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, complained about the arms shipments. The Soviets responded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by sending the guerrillas a reported $ 500 million in arms annually via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, was violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords signed last year that secured the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the rebels and refugees in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> amounts to $ 130 million a year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials decline to acknowledge on the record that any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> arms are being sent to the insurgents.

<HEAD>Group Says Parties Abused Legal Loophole in Campaign Spending</HEAD>

 National and state officials of both major political parties deny a study group's charge that they pumped money exempt from federal regulation into last year's presidential campaign. In a report issued Tuesday, the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Responsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic parties in nine battleground states received $ 28.5 million in so-called `` soft money'' donations not covered by federal limits. Included in the total were contributions of more than $ 7.5 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and more than $ 2 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Anyone can see there was wholesale erosion of our campaign finance laws during last year's presidential campaign,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the center, a bipartisan group that studies campaign finance. But the parties say the center is taking a one-sided view of campaign spending. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the report `` really ignores the fact that ... we operate on two levels, under federal laws and under state laws.'' <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzano </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` They sort of want to federalize the process, which is not going to be realistic. When you put money into state parties, that's a state issue and the state has to deal with that, and they do n't want federal involvement.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, contacted in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said, `` Those folks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, are looking through the wrong end of the telescope, and I do n't know if a microscope would help.'' <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the Democratic party in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has not been carried by a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, is more interested in protecting its state and local candidates from a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> sweep than in promoting a presidential candidate. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>'s Republican counterpart, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, said his party uses contributions that are exempt from federal limits for research, recruitment and training of candidates and for administrative functions. But Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the group found `` obvious patterns of questionable soft money giving. No wonder voters have so little confidence in our politicians when they are sabotaging our laws like this.'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the group concluded soft money was used toward the presidential race because 11 individuals and eight businesses each contributed more than $ 100,000 in the nine states and 42 percent of the money came from out-of-state sources including the two national political parties. Also, much of the money was given in key presidential states and about a third of the money was given in the last four weeks. Although corporations and labor unions are barred from contributing directly to campaigns for federal office, and individual contributions are limited, they may make unlimited contributions in most states for state and local campaigns, party building and voter drives. This is called `` soft money'' and is not supposed to be used in campaigns for federal office. The center wants such contributions brought under federal control. The study covered 7,098 contributions by individuals, corporations, unincorporated businesses, trade associations and the Democratic and Republican national committees to state parties in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Individuals gave $ 9.2 million to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> state parties and $ 1.8 million to Democratic state parties. Corporations gave nearly $ 6.5 million, almost of a third of it to the Republican parties. Soft money contributions to Republican parties from all sources came to $ 16.7 million and to $ 11.8 million for Democratic parties, according to the study. Republicans received more than Democrats in all states except <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had the largest infusion of soft money, $ 5.8 million to the Republican party and $ 4.4 million to the Democrats. Other state totals were: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, $ 4.7 million; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, $ 4.4 million; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 3.2 million; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, $ 2.1 million; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, $ 1.5 million; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just under $ 1 million; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> $ 883,000 and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> $ 345,286. `` The bottom line is we do not go above the law or <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations when we are putting money into states for various races,'' Ms. <PERSON> Terzano </PERSON> said. `` We put our money into the state, and we use it and the money is directed according to <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> regulations.''

<HEAD>OMB Details Where Hundreds of Billions of Tax Dollars in Jeopardy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top managers of federal agencies believe tens of billions of tax dollars are jeopardized by waste, fraud and shoddy practices, according to an inventory of `` high-risk programs'' compiled by the Office of Management and Budget. The list is a department-by-department blueprint of costly flaws in the way the federal government conducts the people's business. It was made public Tuesday by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that warnings about the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> went unheeded until flaws grew into an estimated $ 6 billion crisis and praised budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> for trying to identify `` programs which could become our next HUDs.'' `` He's really bringing some of these things to light ... so that we'll know if there are any more of those <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> situations out there,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it gave the list to <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said the administration plans to work closely with <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> to develop `` management systems and internal controls sufficient to deal with the high risks identified on the list.'' The list detailed problems with more than 70 programs. Among them: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> pays for goods it does n't receive and ca n't account for, or adequately trace, $ 56.5 billion worth of government property that's in the hands of government contractors _ There's a $ 58.5 billion difference between the amount of money the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> records say has been received from workers and the amount indicated by <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> records _ At the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, 1.89 million documents are missing or misfiled <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> has been holding a series of hearings on government efficiency. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, told <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s committee last month that `` inadequate financial controls'' resulted in the loss of $ 4 billion at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, more than $ 10 billion in military sales and loans to foreign governments and $ 12 billion dollars at the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` All of the major agencies have serious problems,'' Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> told the committee. `` Unfortunately, time and time again we find situations where agencies and auditors have identified problems, yet the corrective actions taken, if any, are ineffective and the problems remain uncorrected for years.'' In October, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told the committee the list of risky areas was being put together with the intention of devoting `` significant attention to correcting these vulnerabilities over time.'' `` I have instructed <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> budget staff to give priority to providing resources to needed corrections,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> testified. He also said the problems encountered at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> `` are not unique.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he asked federal managers to report weaknesses that might lead to waste and fraud, and their reports showed `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was n't the worst. It was in the middle of the pack, which leads one to worry about any number of other big problems out there.'' The 27-page list covers the well-publicized problems at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear plants and highlights numerous others. The list criticizes the financial controls set up for the Superfund environmental cleanup program. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> does n't log some `` accounts receivable'' until payments come in, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general found $ 8 million of such accounts in one regional office, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has failed to collect more than $ 63 billion worth of delinquent taxes. The list also noted <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> compensation and pension programs have made $ 53 million in overpayments. Benefit decisions `` have not always been appropriate or correct,'' the document said.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says hearings that led to the resignation of savings and loan regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> are `` just the beginning'' of his investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis. Wall resigned just two weeks after the committee completed 50 hours of hearings focusing on the regulator's handling of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is expected to become the nation's biggest S & amp; L failure, expected to cost taxpayers more than $ 2 billion `` This is just the beginning,'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` We started with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> because it's the prototype ... of everything that went wrong.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said he may conduct more hearings on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and the panel later would explore other S & amp; L failures, including <ORGANIZATION> Silverado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. The Silverado case is politically sensitive because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, served on <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s board of directors. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the committee will concentrate on the constitutional question of how in 1988 Wall's agency, without specific congressional authorization, was able to commit the government to spending $ 40 billion on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescues. The panel also will explore whether the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should have more vigorously pursued shady S & amp; L executives. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> avoided questions about whether the president or his top aides wanted Wall to quit. `` He resigned and it will be accepted,'' he said. Under legislation enacted in August, the director of the thrift office serves a five-year term and must be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which returns from holiday recess next month. According to an industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials who oversee Wall's agency favor appointing an experienced regulator to succeed Wall. Early speculation is centered on several officials who have worked for either the Federal Reserve System or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Neither Wall nor his immediate predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, had regulatory experience. Wall had served as staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> under Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, R-Utah. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was a former public relations executive and press secretary to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 campaign. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the new thrift regulator `` has to be able to stand up to powerful interests within the industry, on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and, frankly, within the administration. ... He's got to be able to inspire public confidence.'' `` You need someone who does not come out of the political environment as Wall did. Rather, you need a tough, experienced regulator who has a long history in banking regulation and knows the ins and outs of the industry,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, also a banking panel member. Wall, in a news conference announcing his resignation Monday, defended his record and said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> resorted to `` corruption of the truth and abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> dismissed Wall's complaint Tuesday. `` Down here in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ... we know that when a skunk is frightened and retreating _ that is when he is spraying the hardest.'' The committee chairman also rejected complaints his intense criticism of Wall had made it all but impossible for the administration to find someone else willing step into the cross fire. `` Watergate did n't deter people from running for the presidency,'' he said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was preparing to hear arguments Thursday in a lawsuit challenging the federal takeover of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. Among the witnesses subpoenaed are <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickwit </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, declined Tuesday to indicate whether <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> would testify or assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the target of a $ 1.1 billion federal fraud and racketeering suit. Among the 11 individual defendants in the fraud suit is <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a former two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who is chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the board of directors of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is not accused of fraud or racketeering, but is named in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who served on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> board, has said he attended only two board meetings. His lawyer, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON>, has said he was seeking to have <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s name removed from the government's suit. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> on Tuesday declined to comment on the suit, saying, `` As long as this matter is in litigation, I'm not really able to discuss that.''

The Free Press remains a morning newspaper weekdays. The News will have one morning edition available for street sales only and three editions for afternoon home delivery. There will be joint weekend editions under the masthead of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Free Press. The price for the Sunday edition will go up to $ 1 from 75 cents this Sunday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Hall, publisher and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes the newspapers, the ninth - and 10th-largest in the country, will maintain their circulation Home subscription rates will remain unchanged at least through December, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which handles business and publishing matters for the newspapers. Wednesday's edition of the Free Press said the DNA had begun telling advertisers of its new rates, but company officials declined to disclose the size of the increase. The <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, first requested in 1986, was approved by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in 1988 but stalled by court challenges from a coalition of readers and advertisers. Legal delays ended Nov. 13, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 4-4 tie on an appeal let stand lower court rulings upholding the agreement.

 Federal health officials say laboratory findings that very high doses of the anti-AIDS drug AZT cause tumors in aging laboratory rodents should cause little concern for people with AIDS. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, the top health official at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the results are significant, they do not show AZT causes cancer in humans. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> still strongly recommends that AIDS patients ... continue their zidovudine -LRB- AZT -RRB- therapy under consultation with their physicians,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON>, director of the AIDS division at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, noted in the study conducted by the maker of AZT, <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the rodents received much higher doses of AZT for a much longer time than AIDS patients do. `` We know that AZT prolongs life in humans -LRB- with AIDS -RRB-,'' he said. `` When you compare that known benefit of AZT to the theoretical risk of tumors, the only right thing to do is to continue using AZT.'' AZT is the only drug approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that attacks the AIDS virus directly. It was approved in March 1987. More than 40,000 AIDS patients take AZT in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sent notice to physicians informing them of the study's findings that some of the rats and mice that received very high doses of AZT for most of their normal life spans developed vaginal tumors at the end of their lives. The results, the company said, `` are of limited predictive value for humans.'' Though the results raise the possibility of a carcinogenic potential in general, they should not be interpreted as applying only to the vagina or to women, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. The company said in its study that high doses of AZT were given to 360 female rats and mice for about 22 months, almost their entire normal life span. The test rodents were divided into three groups and each given different doses of the drug. Of the 120 receiving the highest dose, seven developed cancerous vaginal tumors and two had benign vaginal tumors, <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> said. One benign tumor was found in the group receiving the middle dose while no treatment-related tumors were seen at the lowest dose, the company said. The company said no treatment-related tumors were observed in an equal number of male rodents. `` Tumors in rodents were observed on laboratory examination toward the end of their life-span, and only in animals which had received very high doses of zidovudine,'' said the company, based in <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>'s studies were part of routine tests that are carried out on new drugs and take about three years to conduct, the company said.

 From engaging <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the stormy Med to taking <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> to the ballpark or picking up the phone for a chat with the pope, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brand of diplomacy is personal and non-stop <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has traveled to 14 countries as president. And, according to White House statisticians, he has held 105 separate one-on-one meetings with presidents, prime ministers and kings. Just home from his meeting with the Soviet leader at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is getting ready to embark on yet another foreign trip _ a meeting next week with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. True to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s whirlwind style, he'll squeeze that trip into one day, leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early in the morning and returning late at night. Those leaders <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't get around to meeting this year he'll just have to phone _ or meet next year So far on the 1990 calendar there's a drug summit in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in February, an expected trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and one to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> being considered. A 23-nation summit in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to sign an arms treaty has been proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and at some point there's bound to be a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conducts diplomacy like he plays golf: he rushes from one event to the next. When he is n't personally entertaining them, he's reaching out to touch world leaders by phone In the days before his waterlogged summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and called the other 13 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies by phone, according to press spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. He also called the leaders of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to discuss the summit. To discuss the issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a transatlantic phone call to Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> last summer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met the pope during a visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in May. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> works quickly to try to establish a personal rapport with world leaders. He took Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for a ride in a golf cart, escorted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> through the woods and over the rocks at his oceanfront home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and took a somewhat bewildered <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> by presidential helicopter to a <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> baseball game. He has invited Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. He persuaded Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> and his wife to visit him in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on their honeymoon visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And he showed off the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s Air and Space Museum to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. `` He has used the personal touch much more than most past presidents,'' said deputy press secretary <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. Even though the summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was curtailed and logistics disrupted by a fierce storm, the two met long enough for Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to declare: `` There's a potential for real chemistry here between these two leaders.'' Of his meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` The emotional part of it is hard to describe for me because I'm not the most articulate emotionalist. But I just ca n't have asked for a better ambiance, a better feel from the meetings, even though the differences are acute in some areas.'' <PERSON> Gennadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the Soviet spokesman, paid <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an indirect compliment, suggesting he was far better prepared than former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> joked that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had left his `` thick reference book somewhere else, I guess on another ship.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> who specializes in the presidency, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ability to establish personal relationships with world leaders `` turns out to be extremely useful.'' `` The agenda of the world is involving the American president very deeply and probably will for the rest of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s term,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. Anyway, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> added, even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed he wanted to be the education president, `` what he really wanted to be all along was the ` international-affairs president.'''

<HEAD>$1 Billion Construction Contract Narrowed To Three Groups of Firms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three teams of firms remain in the running for a $ 1 billion contract to manage engineering and construction of the $ 5.9 billion supercollider, say industry and congressional officials. Officials said a final decision on the contractor would be made next year. The award would be the largest single contract involved in building the super collider, a 53-mile underground ring where scientists would test theories about the building blocks of the universe by smashing together atomic particles. The offices of Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, announced the three finalist teams late Tuesday and said they had been chosen from a field of 14 competitors. `` The fact that these invitations have already been made indicates that the SSC program is right on schedule,'' said <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, whose district includes the superconducting supercollider site. Officials representing some of the firms involved confirmed their selection late Tuesday, and said their companies had learned of the decision from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Confirmation from <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> was not immediately available. The finalist teams were identified as: <PERSON> Fluor-Daniel </PERSON>, the construction arm of <ORGANIZATION> Fluor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> ICF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, Brinckerhoff, <PERSON> Quade </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferguson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> CRSS </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; and a joint venture of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mendenhall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a management and operations entity working on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, would employ the chosen contractor. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year appropriated $ 225 million to begin initial construction of the SSC.

<HEAD>Cases Linked to Suspect L-trytophan Still Rising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of reported cases of a sometimes fatal blood disorder linked to the nutritional supplement L-tryptophan is up to 720, federal health officials say. While the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> continues to investigate cases reported by state health departments, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is testing samples of the substance and making sure it remains off store shelves and stopped in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. As of Tuesday, 720 cases from 48 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> had been reported to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. One death has been reported and others are being investigated. Only <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> have reported no cases. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has established a link between the nutritional supplement and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, swelling of the arms and legs, skin rash and sometimes fever. L-tryptophan, an amino acid, is found naturally in many foods. Some people take supplements of L-tryptophan to treat sleeplessness, depression, premenstrual syndrome, stress and other problems. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it has been detaining all L-tryptophan shipments, including bulk supplies of the supplement, at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports as a follow-up to its Nov. 17 request for a nationwide recall of L-tryptophan tablets, capsules and caplets. The investigation has not established whether L-tryptophan itself or some contaminant introduced during manufacture or distribution is causing the syndrome. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it has collected several hundred products and has begun to analyze them for possible evidence of chemical or microbial contamination. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> investigators recently visited L-tryptophan manufacturing plants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a leading supplier of the supplement to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers. Japanese officials have been cooperating with American investigators, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s initial analysis of data on 85 cases shows most of those who developed the syndrome were women taking between 1 and 2 grams per day of L-tryptophan, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The daily intake of the supplement ranged from 150 milligrams to 18 grams.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman in whose backyard police say they found a large rebel ammunition cache declared before being driven off to jail, charged with terrorism, that she would prove her innocence in court. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, was charged Tuesday under the country's terrorism law with possession of weapons of war, she and her lawyer, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON>, said as the emerged from the new downtown judicial complex Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> had made a sworn deposition to military Judge <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> in a closed, four-hour session. If convicted, she faces 20 years in prison. `` I'm being taken to the women's prison. It's a place I've taken many delegations, a place where I've interviewed many prisoners. I guess now I'll be on the other side,'' she told reporters as she left the judge's chambers. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> avoided reporters and there was no indication when the case would go to trial. A native of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> and a former <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> resident, Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> has represented <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for nearly five years. The San Antonio-based organization arranges fact-finding tours for Americans, including congressmen. She denies collaborating with leftist guerrillas, who have been fighting a 10-year-old war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments and last month turned the capital into a combat zone with their largest offensive ever. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> says she knows nothing of the more than 20,000 rounds of assault rifle ammunition, explosives and detonator caps police say they found buried behind her house on Nov. 25. She rented the house three months ago, she says, and has been traveling much of the time since then. Members of the military and the rightist administration of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> have accused clergy and church workers of sympathizing with and even aiding the rebels. During last month's offensive, six Jesuit priests were murdered during a nighttime curfew by men said by a witness to have been in uniform. Elements connected to the military are widely believed to be responsible. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who came to help in Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s defense, says deportation is probably the easiest way out for her. But Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> says she wants to face the charges. `` The accusations against me are false,'' she told reporters Tuesday. `` This is a first step and the rest will be decided by the long judicial process here. `` Let us prove our innocence publicly. We're not going to go behind the scenes,'' she said. Wearing a white blouse and beige skirt, she appeared tired but in good spirits when she talked with reporters before and after meeting with the judge. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> had spent 10 days under arrest at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, where she said she spent evenings singing hymns and reading the Bible with other prisoners and talked about scripture with her wardens. `` I have faith in all the people who have written me letters, in their prayers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said before being driven off to prison. `` I ca n't say I have faith in the system to find me innocent. But I believe my innocence will shine through.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who left the country on Tuesday, said he would return to help with the trial. He said he believed her chances for acquittal were good. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said charging Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was a mistake and vowed to continue his efforts to win her release `` I believe the prosecutors in the Casolo case have made a terrible mistake _ a regrettable mistake,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said in a statement late Tuesday. `` But this is only one step in a judicial process, and I believe the truth will out. As long as it takes, I will continue to work for <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s release.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee.

<TEXT>
 Despite a country in chaos, East German leaders have managed to make more diplomatic breakthroughs with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the last two days than in the last two decades. A planned summit, the establishment of a hard currency fund for tourists, and agreements on trade, transportation and the environment all have defied the turbulence at the top. The accomplishments testify both to the stubborn resolve of those Communists still in power to keep the country working, and to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to act quickly while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is overwhelmed by events. Two East German Communist leaderships have fallen in less than two months, so one might expect the wheels of government and diplomacy to have slowed. But in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s case, the tumult has actually accelerated an orderly effort to close gaps and work together on projects of mutual interest. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the two Germanys on Tuesday, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Dec. 19. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will meet Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, rather than in the capital of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, to avoid de facto recognition of the sovereignty of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The West German leader's refusal to travel to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was a condition that <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who led <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 18 years until his mid-October ouster, found unacceptable. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> on Tuesday in talks that made progress in a broad array of issues concerning both states. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> issued a joint account of their talks, describing them as productive and businesslike and ticking off an impressive list of accomplishments. The thorniest issue settled was providing East German tourists with convertible currency for trips to the West. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has traditionally offered 100-mark gifts, about $ 54, of `` welcome money'' to East German arrivals once each year because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> only would convert the equivalent of $ 8 a day for travelers. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> announced that the West German budget for welcome money next year, $ 405 million, was being handed over to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to contribute to a hard-currency pool for tourists. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> explained that under the agreement, East German adults will be entitled to receive up to $ 108 per year in hard currency, and parents can receive another 100 West German marks for each child under 14. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in turn, has agreed to drop a mandatory exchange rule that required West Germans visiting the Communist state to convert to East German marks -LRB- at an unfavorable rate -RRB- at least $ 13.50 for each day they were in the country. West Germans also will no longer need visas to enter <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after Jan. 1, when the new currency exchange system also takes effect.

<HEAD>Health Officials: Climate Changes Threaten to Spread Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While changes in the Earth's climate threaten to encourage the spread of diseases like rabies, the changes may also damage the human body's ability to fight them, health officials are warning. A conference on `` Global Atmospheric Change and Public Health'' was told Tuesday that potential problems stem both from the increase in ultraviolet radiation, as the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere is damaged, and from climate warming, which many scientists believe is occurring in a so-called Greenhouse effect. Ultraviolet radiation, already known to cause skin cancer, also has a major effect in reducing the response of the human immune system, said Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Daynes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time the immune system damage is being threatened, warming of the climate could lead to the spread of diseases currently limited by the climate, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shope </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Safety Panel: School Bleachers at Risk of Collapsing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Certain indoor school bleachers are at risk of collapsing because of poor maintenance and improper operation, school officials are being told. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> warned school administrators nationwide Tuesday that bleachers should be routinely inspected and maintained at least twice a year. In addition, only trained personnel, not students, should be used to operate the bleachers, the commission said in a statement.

The commission said 16 collapses since 1978 have produced back, arm, leg and ankle injuries.

<HEAD>Bishops, Catholic Politicians Lock Horns Over Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The link between faith and politics is being tested as the threat of ecclesiastical sanctions hangs over Roman Catholic officials targeted in a special appeal by the nation's bishops to restrict legalized abortion. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislator banned from Communion for advocating abortion rights held a narrow lead in a special election Tuesday. But Catholic politicians everywhere are feeling the heat of an aggressive church hierarchy that has banned dissent on abortion among its 53-million members. `` I'm not as interested in getting re-elected as I am getting into heaven,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Amari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. Some Catholic lawmakers, noting the struggles of their predecessors such as <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> against historical prejudices that they were surrogates for the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, say the bishops are out of line. `` The church has control over my moral life. It does n't have control over my political life,'' said Assembly Speaker-elect <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. With the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opening the way for the states to impose restrictions on abortion in its ruling in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, the bishops last month plunged into the debate by calling abortion `` the fundamental human rights issue.'' They also said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislators have a special moral responsibility to work to curtail abortion. The bishops did not take a stand on whether penalties should be imposed, but several <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders said the church should discuss the possibility and action has been taken in some dioceses. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>, who clung to a 1,500-vote lead today in a special election for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was barred by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> from receiving Communion because of her abortion rights commercials. `` The bishop had an incredible impact on this race,'' said <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent, <PERSON> Assemblywoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>. `` In one letter, he created an instant international celebrity and a martyr.'' <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s bishops have asked <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politicians not to publicly contradict the church on abortion, and two officials who spoke at an abortion rights rally have been called on the carpet. In <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the diocesan newspaper told politicians they had to sign a declaration supporting a constitutional amendment against abortion if they wanted to advertise holiday greetings. Many Catholic politicians are wondering if the sword of church sanctions would fall on their heads. `` People have been waiting to see if the church is going to come along with a sledgehammer to get <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politicians in line,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davitt </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. As have many leaders of the abortion rights movement, the bishops said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling permitting legislative action strips the credibility of the `` I'm personally opposed, but ...' reasoning <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> said neither politicians nor the public can have a `` double conscience'' on abortion. But many Catholic politicians still adhere to the policy articulated in 1984 by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in defense of Vice Presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>: that public morality is a matter of prudential political judgment. `` I personally oppose abortion, but before I commit to anything I'm going to do a survey,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Some said the bishops' hard-line stand will influence the public policy debate on abortion. `` A lot of my constituents are Catholics. They are influenced by what the bishops say _ as they should be and as I should be,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But many predicted the prelates' stand would backfire. `` It's a complete misreading of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and our representative form of government,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Prentiss </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> and abortion rights advocate. `` Representatives are not elected to represent their religious faith, they are elected to represent their constituents.'' But the prelates were unanimous in their defense of the right of the church to enter into the debate, and even for individual bishops to administer sanctions. `` The question of church-state relationship and separation is a long and complex one. It is noxious to apply that principle if the intent is to isolate the church from public discussion in regard to public policy,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> of the Archdiocese of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Some politicians agreed. `` When we talk about the First Amendment, we forget the first part, free exercise of religion,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tempore <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` With the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, people generally emphasize the separation of church and state and not the free exercise of religion. There is the right of even bishops and clergy to have free speech.''

 A rocketry scientist convicted of trying to ship sophisticated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile technology to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has been sentenced to 46 months in prison. <PERSON> Abdelkader </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, 41, also was fined $ 358,690 and ordered to forfeit about a half-million dollars, all part of what prosecutors said were $ 1 million in payments dispensed to <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> intelligence operatives via <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks. `` This is not a cloak-and-dagger espionage case,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said at Tuesday's sentencing. `` This was a case, to put it bluntly, of greed. ... He thought he would make a lot of money and thought he would make a favor befall the sovereign nation of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also credited <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> for the 18 months he spent in jail awaiting trial. The Egyptian-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen pleaded guilty in June to one count of illegally exporting about 420 pounds of a carbon-based material used in the construction of nose cones, rocket nozzles and other weapons-related machinery. Eleven counts, including money laundering and conspiracy, were dropped in return for the plea and his promise to cooperate with prosecutors. `` I would like you to consider me as a human being,'' <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> told the judge, `` and human beings make mistakes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is my country and I never intended to hurt it.'' The material, called carbon-carbon, had been developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It has a low visibility to radar and is heat resistant. It is used extensively in Stealth aircraft, missiles and rockets. Carbon-carbon is on the federal government's restricted list, and its export requires a special license. An associate of <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>'s, 47-year-old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was sentenced to 41 months in prison and fined $ 7,500. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, who worked as a representative of the Hollister-based <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly used his expertise as a 20-year veteran marketing specialist to help <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> in the exporting scheme. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> characterized the export scheme as a `` large, complex, intricate conspiracy'' developed by the Egyptians with financial backing from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to get sensitive weapons-grade rocket materials. He said that had the conspiracy succeeded and the technology and materials reached the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had planned to split the fruits of the scheme. An attorney for <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Topel </PERSON>, had claimed his client was recruited by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s then-defense minister, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Abdel-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosectors said two Egyptian nationals also have been charged in the case. They are <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussam </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Din </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairat </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> army officer who allegedly supervised the export scheme from a headquarters in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Algamal </PERSON>, an Egyptian colonel. Both are fugitives. The federal grand jury indictment also linked two other Egyptians to the plot _ assistant military attache <PERSON> Abd </PERSON> <PERSON> Elrahin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elgohary </PERSON> and Egyptian Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>. Both men, who had been based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, claimed diplomatic immunity and were not charged. <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> was a top propulsion scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> were arrested in 1988 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents seized a load of carbon material and other goods from an aircraft waiting to take off for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has warned <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> not to take advantage of the political upheaval in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc by pushing too quickly for reunification with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> met with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and with his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, on Tuesday to discuss a topic that was once considered taboo between East and West. Afterward, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as recalling the Soviets' experience with a strong <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War II. It said he told <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> that `` propaganda about a federation of the two Germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the current circumstances.'' `` An attempt to use difficulties in the reconstruction process in socialist countries for one-sided, selfish goals, without taking into account the long-term general European interests, can threaten the accumulated positive developments, stability and peace on the continent,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. At the weekend superpower summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cautioned President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that a swift push toward reunification could create tensions. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told a news conference he assured <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that both Germanys `` will keep in mind their responsibility for the security of the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, `` The current developments touch on deep-rooted interests of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the countries of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and finally all Europeans. `` The Soviet people well remember history and the tragic lesson of the Second World War,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in recent weeks has tempered his previous clear opposition to reunification of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> with </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where public unrest has toppled two governments in six weeks and acclerated reform to a break-neck pace. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> recently outlined a detailed plan for reunification. While objecting to any immediate call for reunification, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has indicated a willingness to let history decide. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that, `` Despite the acuteness of the problem, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is prepared to discuss it in the spirit of new thinking, presupposing respect for the stand of the other.'' But according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s side of the discussion that resulted was strongly worded. He said some of the 10 points in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s reunification plan sounded like orders to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` demanding irreversible changes in its political and economic system.'' A separate <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comment to <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> was far milder. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that under the present circumstances of rapid change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and improving relations between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, `` it is especially important to support international stability and to strengthen security,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` This suggests self-restraint, responsibility and deliberation in actions from all states, and loyal cooperation on the basis of generally accepted principles,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> added, paraphrasing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told reporters that he assured <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` There is not going to be a separate German course.'' He said German rapprochement will occur only within general European rapprochement, and `` we will do everything to create stable, cooperative structures'' to ensure the security of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> refused to discuss <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s response. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said that <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> shared their desires to reach agreements on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons and conventional armed forces, and on a ban on chemical weapons.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Mormons Who Exercise, Don't Smoke Live Longer Than Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An eight-year study of 10,000 Mormons suggests that people who exercise regularly and do n't smoke live longer, healthier lives. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Enstrom </PERSON>, who studied the habits of religiously active Mormons in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said his research shows those who follow the church's teachings against using tobacco and who exercise and get seven to eight hours sleep a night are far healthier than people in the general white population. `` We knew from previous studies of Mormon death records that this population has an unusually low cancer mortality rate that is only partially explained by their lack of smoking,'' said <PERSON> Enstrom </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The current study allowed us to follow a large group of active Mormons over a long period of time and to examine subgroups adhering to specific health habits.'' The study examined three general health habits: never smoking cigarettes, regular physical exercise and regular sleep. The males involved in the study were all high priests, the highest lay position in the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. The women were wives of high priests. That particular group was selected, <ORGANIZATION> Enstrom </ORGANIZATION> said, because its members would be more likely than other Mormons to strictly adhere to church doctrine banning alcohol, tobacco and caffeine use. The study found that middle-age high priests who did n't smoke and who exercised and slept well had 34 percent the rate of cancer mortality as middled-aged white men in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The high priests also had only 14 percent the rate of cardiovascular disease mortality and 22 percent the rate of overall mortality, <PERSON> Enstrom </PERSON> said Middle-age wives of high priests who followed the same health habits had only a 55 percent rate of cancer death compared to middle-aged white women, <PERSON> Enstrom </PERSON> said. They had a 34 percent rate of cardiovascular disease mortality and a 47 percent rate of overall mortality. Further, a 25-year-old high priest can expect to live to age 85, compared with a life expectancy of 74 for 25-year-old white males, <PERSON> Enstrom </PERSON> said. A 25-year-old high priest wife has a life expectancy of 86 years, compared with 80 for other white 25-year-old females, <PERSON> Enstrom </PERSON> said. The results of the survey, conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, were to be published in the December issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager charged in the slaying of actress <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> was ordered to stand trial for murder after testimony from witnesses that included chilling, graphic accounts of her killing. Municipal Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> ordered the trial after a daylong preliminary hearing Tuesday into the death of the young woman who starred in the old television series `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, appeared groggy as he came and went from the courtroom. Public defender <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> said he believed his client was on medication. The judge upheld a special circumstances charge _ lying in wait _ that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty if <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> is convicted of first-degree murder. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> will be arraigned Dec. 11. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> was the gunman who walked up to Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s apartment house on July 18 and opened fire when she came to the door. The 21-year-old actress was struck once in the chest and died. Among the witnesses was Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s next-door neighbor, actress <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marta </PERSON>, who revealed that the intercoms in the apartment house were broken when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> responded to the door buzzer by opening the security door. She said the young woman could not have talked to the person at the door to find out who was there. `` I heard her pass my door,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> said. `` In what seemed like a second there was a blast that sounded like a cannon. The door shook. The wall shook and the cat went up in the air. I fell down on the floor.'' Asked what happened next, the witness, in tears, said: `` I heard <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>'s first scream. I got to the phone and dialed 911. ... <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> was moaning and wailing by the time I got to the door. `` I opened the little window hatch in the door and there was a smell I will never forget as long as I live. It was the smell of gunfire and it was quiet except for this little moaning.'' Ms. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> said she stepped into the hallway and called Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s name, but no response came. She said she stayed there until paramedics arrived. Other witnesses told how <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> spent three hours before the attack clutching <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s picture to his chest and stalking her neighborhood in search of her apartment. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> had gotten her address from a private detective agency, a witness said. In quick succession, five witnesses identified <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> as the young man who stalked Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> and was seen running away from her house moments after gunshots and a scream shattered the calm of the quiet neighborhood about 10:30 a.m.

<HEAD>Cell Defect Found in Parkinson's Disease Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists say they have detected a blood-cell defect in people with Parkinson's disease, a link that could help identify victims before symptoms appear. Such timely identification could open the door for earlier treatment of the disease that afflicts 400,000 Americans. The findings, published Tuesday in the Annals of Neurology, are the product of federally funded research by Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Parkinson's is a neurological condition characterized by gradually worsening tremors, muscle rigidity and weakness _ symptoms blamed on the disappearance of key brain cells. The scientists reported finding what appears to be an enzyme deficiency inside blood cells of Parkinson's patients, suggesting the disease affects more than just the brain cells it kills. In normal cells, the enzyme is used to neutralize so-called free radicals, the byproducts of oxidation. Free radicals have been shown, in previous research, to be capable of killing the same brain cells destroyed in Parkinson's disease. Scientists cautioned that the new conclusions offer no immediate help for people with Parkinson's. But the rewards of nailing down the origins of Parkinson's would be enormous. `` It sounds really exciting to me,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got to be cautious,'' added <PERSON> Fahn </PERSON>, who last month co-authored the results of nationwide trials on the promising anti-Parkinson's drug deprenyl. `` It certainly is a new direction. No one has ever found a defect like this before,'' he said.

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to four more active ice volcanoes on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> were discovered in snapshots taken by <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the fastest yet seen in the solar system. Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, `` chances are that there are a dozen of these things going off globally'' at any time, said <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a planetary scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2 after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug. 24-25 flight past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced Tuesday during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> is only the third world in the solar system known to have active volcanism. The others are Earth and <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, which has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are volcanoes on cloud-shrouded <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s atmosphere. `` These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the previous record winds of 1,100 mph in <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s jet stream, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 1.'' The speed of sound on Earth is about 700 mph, depending on temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s air. The clouds racing in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s winds could be seen in a movie made by computer from still photographs taken by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>. Also shown at Tuesday's news conference was another computer movie clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar system. The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud also is visible. The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three more plumes, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. When Voyager swept past <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> early Aug. 25, scientists saw streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced it was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic analysis of the photos. But the images were so fuzzy `` you had to take our word for it,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. So <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> used a computer to overlap still photos taken from different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes. The causes of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s nitrogen ice volcanoes and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s high winds are mysterious. Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker material beneath. But the heat can not escape through the ice, so some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark material with it. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> gets 900 times less sunlight than Earth. Scientists are perplexed about how the internal heat left over from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot, not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15 and 20 degrees south latitude, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is needed to power high winds, he said. Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission in which it flew past Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. The spacecraft discovered six moons at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, bringing the total to eight, and found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30 times farther from the sun than Earth.

<HEAD>Maryland Escrow Agent Dubbed `Robin HUD' Pleads Innocent in Housing
Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman dubbed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD'' for her claims she purchased cars and housing for the needy with stolen federal housing money has pleaded innocent to embezzlement charges. Former escrow agent <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> pleaded innocent in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Tuesday to charges she embezzled millions of dollars from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Her attorney, public defender <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, said the innocent pleas mean `` a total denial of all allegations in the indictment.'' He refused to comment further. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, 46, did not make any statement during or after her arraignment. She remains free on her own recognizance pending a trial next month. She is accused of embezzling $ 5.6 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, making false statements to the federal government and making false statements in connection with a loan application. She is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping more than $ 10 million they were supposed to transfer to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has said the case represents perhaps the largest single theft of government funds ever charged against an individual. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud, mismanagement and political favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. She admitted stealing millions and buying 20 homes and nearly 40 automobiles for the needy before anyone noticed, earning her the `` Robin HUD'' nickname. Several top officials in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office, to which <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> reported, were fired because of her case and other allegations of mismanagement. Two weeks after <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> testified, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> seized her house in <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The agency also confiscated several other properties <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said she purchased with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to help charities and homeless families. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> is living with her mother in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb. As an escrow agent, <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> collected money from the sales of property that had been foreclosed on by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The properties originally had been purchased with HUD-guaranteed loans. Agents such as <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> earn small commissions for handling the foreclosures and turn over sales proceeds to the government. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that in 1985 she used sales proceeds to cover a $ 37,000 shortfall in her business. She said that when several months passed without an inquiry from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, she concluded the department was so poorly run that it was unable to track the millions of dollars in payments due from escrow agents.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two missiles were fired at the home of the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> ambassador, causing some damage but no injuries, police said. It was the fourth attack against Spanish targets in six weeks. Two windows of the 18th-century building at The Hague's stately Embassy Row were shattered by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades, according to police spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON>. But the grenades apparently failed to explode, said <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON>, adding that the damage to the residence's interior was `` minimal.'' He did not know whether Ambassador <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassot </PERSON> <PERSON> Canadas </PERSON> was present at the time of the attack. The residence is about 25 yards from the Spanish Embassy. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Earlier reports indicated heavier damage. An explosion heard at the time of the attack was believed to have been caused by the firing mechanism of the grenades, <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON> said. Dutch army explosives experts were carefully searching a gray <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> van parked in front of the building, from which the missiles could have been fired, <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON> said. `` Immediately after the explosion, a small fire broke out in that car,'' <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON> told reporters here. Minutes after the incident, police cordoned off the area near the American and British embassies. On Oct. 24, a bomb destroyed the car of the Spanish consul in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>. Three days later, two blasts damaged the trade mission and the labor bureau here. One person was slightly injured in the latter incident. Last month, the Basque terrorist organization <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for those attacks. A statement in a Spanish newspaper said they were in retaliation for the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' 1980 refusal to grant entry to three <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> members, who were subsequently jailed in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. But today, <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON> said that that claim had been `` assigned a low priority'' by Dutch police, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> seldom ventured outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` We have no idea who the perpetrators are,'' <PERSON> Laterveer </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Volcanic Eruption That Gave Rise to Atlantis Legend Dated by NASA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A volcano that inspired the legend of the lost civilization of Atlantis triggered summer frost, crop failure and famine a half a world away, scientists said. The link enabled <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists to date one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history. Ancient Chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about 3,600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> volcano, which destroyed much of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Thera </LOCATION>, near what became <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The eruption was dated to 1600 B.C., give or take 30 years, by researchers headed by astronomer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> presented the findings Tuesday during an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` Not only are we able to get a date for this eruption _ if people agree on the same century that's pretty good _ but we now actually have eyewitness accounts of what happened -LRB- to the weather thousands of miles away in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- after the Thera-Santorini eruption,'' <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said effects of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>'s blast were felt around the world, and <PERSON> Thera </PERSON>'s destruction is believed to be the source of <PERSON> Plato </PERSON>'s story of Atlantis, which tells of an island civilization submerged by the sea after being shaken by earthquakes. `` Recent archaeological studies suggest that ` Atlantis' may have been Minoan centers on <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, destroyed by tidal waves from the Thera-Santorini eruption,'' <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey volcanologist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilling </PERSON> called <PERSON> Pang </PERSON>'s study `` kind of neat He has another line of evidence linking climatic effects to that eruption. ... We need to get a better idea of how often these large eruptions take place and whether there is any pattern to them. That gives us a much better basis to forecast possible future eruptions.'' <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>'s eruption packed the punch of `` 2 million <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> atomic bombs going off at the same time. <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> was roughly 100 times more powerful than Krakatau -LRB- <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, 1883 -RRB-. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION> is a little bitty volcano compared with this.'' <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> called the Thera-Santorini explosion the most powerful volcano eruption in recorded history. Tilling said he was unsure of the latest estimates, but `` it is clearly one of the largest.'' The volcano spewed sunlight-blocking debris and acid aerosols, chilling Earth's climate to cause disturbances noted in historical accounts of the reign of King <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, the last king of the Xia dynasty, which is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s earliest recorded dynasty. `` At the time of King <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, the sun was dimmed,'' the annals say. `` Three suns appeared -LRB- due to ice crystals in the atmosphere refracting the sun's image -RRB-. ... Winter and summer came irregularly. ... Frosts formed in the sixth month -LRB- July on the Chinese calendar -RRB-. ... The five cereals withered. ... Therefore famine occurred. ... There was heavy rainfall and communities were destroyed.'' Cold wet summers also were observed following massive eruptions of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tambora </LOCATION> in 1815, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Laki </PERSON> in 1783 and another <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> volcano in 208 B.C., <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> said. After finding references to <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>'s climatic effects in the Xia dynasty histories, <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> and his colleagues dated those references using Shang Dynasty `` oracle bones'' _ genealogies inscribed on tortoise shells and ox shoulder blades _ and <PERSON> Western </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> royal genealogies. The genealogies previously were dated by linking astronomical events to the reigns of certain kings. In one case, <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> found a historical account of a day that dawned twice that must have been April 21, 899 B.C., when dawn was interrupted by a solar eclipse. <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> said previous studies used volcano-caused excesses of sulfuric acid in ice cores from <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> to estimate Thera erupted happened between 1670 B.C. and 1620 B.C., compared with his date range of 1630 B.C. to 1570 B.C. Stunted growth rings in Irish oak trees and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pines put it between 1613 B.C. and 1631 B.C. `` Some date it as late as the 14th century B.C. and some date it as early as the 18th century B.C.,'' he said. `` Now all the methods are converging on the late 17th century B.C.'' <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> conducted the study with physicist <PERSON> Santosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Srivastava </PERSON> and computer scientist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keston </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, and Hung-hsiang Chou, an Asian languages professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Battle Over Election of Georgia Judges Headed for Justice Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state attorney general plans to turn documents over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for its investigation of whether <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> racially discriminates in the way it elects judges. Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>' decision came Tuesday, a day after a three-judge federal panel in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> released a decision ordering a federal review of 48 judgeships for racial discrimination. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> has until Jan. 1 to submit information to federal officials, who then would have 60 days to file objections to any of the judgeships. Six of the state's 137 <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges are black. The state's population is almost 30 percent black. The panel _ consisting of two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges and one federal appeals judge _ said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges may complete their terms but may not seek re-election until the state obtains clearance of their posts. The panel also said the state may not fill five new judgeships created this year until the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approves them. All 53 of the judgeships are scheduled to be filled by state elections in 1990. At an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> news conference, <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said he would comply with the federal order but he was n't ruling out the possibility of a state appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The federal court ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>; state Rep. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Democrat; and others who contend the state's judicial election laws are discriminatory. <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney handling the case, said he was surprised the state did not maintain its hard-line defense. `` I'm glad they are going to submit the information to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` They should have done it a long time ago.'' The lawsuit contends 48 judgeships created since Nov. 1, 1964, violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act because they were not `` pre-cleared'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as the law requires.

<HEAD>Pope Says Ecological Crisis Threatens World Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> says the ecological crisis is becoming a threat to world peace and can only be solved by overcoming greed, consumerism and indifference to life. In his annual message for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s World Day of Peace, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said Tuesday that the destruction of the environment is actually a moral issue. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said he was n't asking that the modern world return to a `` paradise lost'' but for moderation, discipline and the spirit of sacrifice. Threats to world peace, he said, come not only from the arms race, regional conflicts and social injustice but also `` the plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the quality of life. `` The sense of precariousness and insecurity that such a situation engenders is a seabed for collective selfishness, disregard for others and dishonesty,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in the message, which is sent to world leaders. The pope chooses a different topic each year for the New Year's message and used it to present some of his widest views to date on the environment Last year, he examined threats to peace from ethnic disputes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spared neither industrialized nor developing societies from criticism. `` It is manifestly unjust that a privileged few should continue to accumulate excess goods, squandering available resources, while masses of people are living in conditions of misery at the very lowest level of subsistence,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. But he said `` countries in the process of industrialization are not morally free to repeat the errors made in the past by others, and recklessly continue to damage the environment through industrial pollutants, radical deforestration or unlimited exploitation of non-renewable resources.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did not name any individual country. At a news conference to present the message, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, Monsignor <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, noted that the church in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has spoken out against destruction of forests. The pope condemned genetic manipulation, the `` unscrupulous'' development of new forms of plant and animal life and `` unacceptable experimentation'' on the origins of human life. He lamented that laboratory tests continue on new offensive weapons capable of altering the balance of nature despite international agreements prohibiting chemical, bacteriological and biological warfare. The seriousness of the ecological crisis, he said, `` lays bare the depth of man's moral crisis. If an appreciation of the value of the human person and of human life is lacking, we will also lose interest in others and the earth itself.''

 The wake-up call everybody had been waiting for finally came. Hundreds of foreigners grabbed their luggage, walked out of their hotels and boarded buses today to escape the crossfire of a coup attempt. `` We were just dying to get out, we were afraid that if they -LRB- the rebels -RRB- became desperate, they would get us,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadela </PERSON>, 21, of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A truce between mutinous soldiers who held <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> financial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where many hotels catering to foreigners are located, allowed hundreds to finally flee what had become the heart of the 5-day-old revolt. When the cease-fire went into effect, they were told to pack their bags and board government buses. `` It was slick, it was a superb operation,'' said <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION>, Md. Throughout the morning, buses ferried hundreds of guests from the hotels to a duty-free shopping center 20 minutes away next to the international airport. About 300 people immediately hopped aboard the first available flights out of the country. Among the people shuttled from the financial district by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION>, including residents of <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> apartments, were at least 241 Americans. Natives of more than 40 other countries, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and even <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, were among the 1,800 people rescued. Officials said at least four foreigners remained in the area. The evacuees were happy to have left behind some harrowing experiences. Briton <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevin </PERSON> said he heard gunfire and saw tracers Tuesday night coming from the roof of the Intercontinental Hotel, just above the room where he was staying. `` I thought that if they -LRB- government troops -RRB- started firing back, it would come right at our windows,'' said <PERSON> Chevin </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chevin </PERSON> said he recorded the firefight on videotape, and other guests also went away with <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> mementos. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Auspitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for example, picked up a bullet found next door to her room in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Fanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickins </PERSON>, a British resident of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, took a picture with a rebel leader before boarding the evacuation bus from the Intercontinental. `` I found them all sympathetic, they were very nice and extremely polite, all of them,'' she said of the rebels. Indeed, many of the foreigners had nothing but praise for the mutineers who occupied the hotels. `` They were being very professional about everything, they did n't want to hurt us,'' said <PERSON> Chevin </PERSON>. `` They did not treat us at any time as hostages,'' added <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> said rebels even served a breakfast of bacon and eggs to some of the <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> hotel guests Saturday morning. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> was the first hotel evacuated, with the management using the public address system at dawn to inform guests of the impending move. The Intercontinental came next, followed by the <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, where guests had slept in the lobby. Guests at the hotels said electricity, telephone and water service all had deteriorated by early Wednesday. At the duty-free center, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and several other countries set up reception desks and the government provided assistance for transportation and hotel bookings. `` It feels good,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> as he nursed a cold <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> beer next to a reception desk set up by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm happy to be out.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> today promised more democratic reforms after the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s setback in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s first multiparty elections, acknowledging a decline in his party's credibility. The Nationalists suffered their worst losses in 40 years in power in Saturday's balloting. The party lost several key local county executive posts and garnered 58 percent of the total vote, down from 70 percent in 1986. `` It was a setback for our party as far as our original goal was concerned,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who also chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The decision made by the voters was not a coincidence,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told the party's decision-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` It indicates the various reform measures undertaken by the government in recent years had failed to meet the public's expectations.'' Opposition supporters, meanwhile, ended four days of massive demonstrations against alleged vote fraud after a recounting of ballots began at the heavily guarded <ORGANIZATION> Tainan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. During the election and raucous campaign, the opposition party accused the Nationalists of widespread vote buying and ballot box stuffing. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the government had failed to solve such problems as worsening crime, social morale and `` the authorities' declining credibility.'' `` We must learn our lesson from the setback. We must not hesitate any more,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` We are more sure of our way and will take faster and more positive steps'' toward various political and other reforms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has pushed for the retirement of hundreds of elderly members who dominate the Legislature. They were elected on the Chinese mainland before the Nationalists fled <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 and were frozen in office to support the Nationalists' claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Few have accepted handsome government pensions and filed for retirement. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tainan </LOCATION>, about 2,000 noisy protesters occupied a section of a freeway and stopped traffic for an hour as recounts were stalled by the slow transportation of ballot boxes from eight villages, police and witnesses said. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin-cheng </PERSON>, chief prosecutor of the <ORGANIZATION> Tainan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said the count would take three days because the process was going to be monitored by campaign officers of both the opposition and Nationalist candidates for the county executive post. The <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> candidate was initially declared the winner. On Tuesday, about 10,000 opposition supporters, screaming for a recount, clashed with police who cordoned off a square next to county government offices. Several were injured. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-chieh </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Tainan </LOCATION> and asked for a recount. The government initially refused, fearing all other losing candidates would follow suit.

<TEXT>
 A beleaguered President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a state of national emergency today and pleaded with fellow Filipinos to defy the hundreds of mutinous soldiers who `` want to kill me.'' The declaration came after a cease-fire between rebel and loyalist troops enabled about 1,800 foreigners, hundreds of them Americans, to be evacuated from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s financial district, scene of heavy fighting since Saturday. The rebels, angered at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, had on Tuesday threatened to prevent some Americans from leaving. Today, they issued a veiled threat against those who remain in the country. After the evacuation, rebel and military representatives then opened talks for a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had previously vowed not to negotiate, demanding that the rebels `` surrender or die.'' She had also overruled recommendations from <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members two days ago to declare a state of emergency. `` You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you,'' the obviously strained and fatigued Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said on natonal television before declaring the emergency. She appealed for a show of `` people power'' in the streets on Friday similar to the 1986 demonstrations that helped put her in office. The plea came five days after thousands of mutineers launched the strongest attempt yet to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration, which has been widely criticized as indecisive and inept. It was unclear what specific powers Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would be able to wield under the emergency declaration. Press Secretary <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> said the government planned to take over utilities and transport but not the media. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmena </PERSON> said most of the 23 senators endorsed the move and he expected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to grant Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> sweeping powers. But opposition Rep. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Britannico </PERSON> said it would discourage foreign investment and tourism: `` The opposition believes that it is a first step ... toward the declaration of martial law.'' Cabinet officials said the declaration was not tantamount to martial law and that there would be no curtailment of civil liberties. `` This is not martial law,'' said Labor Secretary <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Drilon </PERSON>. `` There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will continue. We will continue to enjoy our rights. It only empowers government to check those who may not be delivering basic services.'' The announcement came as estimated 400 rebel soldiers continued to hold the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> financial district and a similar number of mutineers held an air base on <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Opposition sources claim the rebels also have the support of other units that have not moved overtly against the government. The insurrection, the sixth in Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s nearly 4-year-old government, has claimed the lives of at least 77 people and left more than 540 wounded. On national television tonight, the president attempted to rekindle the now-dormant `` people power'' that toppled <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled her into office with a plea for people to take to the streets on Friday. She said the rebels wanted to dismantle democracy and return the nation to the dark days of martial law, which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> imposed from 1972 until 1981. `` I am telling you now that I put so much at stake for democracy,'' the president said, speaking extemporaneously. `` I have lost my husband. ... It is very clear that these people want to kill me, want to eliminate me so that they can rule our land,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was slain in 1983 moments after returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for leadership. The rebels have demanded that she resign in favor of a coalition to pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government. The have accused her of ignoring corruption, refusing to intiate social and economic reforms, and failing to crush the Communist insurgency. Early today, buses began transporting foreigners trapped in hotels and condominiums in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, which the insurgents seized on Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and Philippine authorities said at least 241 Americans were among the foreigners taken out safely. During the evacuation, military chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> designated Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, to negotiate with the rebels in the financial district. Sporadic sniping resumed, however, when the evacuation was completed. More than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and a shopping area near the airport, where evacuees were taken until arrangements could be made for them to leave the country. `` It was slick,'' said <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, of the evacuation. He had been stranded at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Garden Hotel. `` It was a superb operation. I think there's certainly relief.'' A rebel officer had said trapped Americans might not go free because, in a gesture of support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, whose term expires in June 1992. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes providing air cover for loyalist forces early in the revolt. But a statement issued today said the insurgents' executive committee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because `` these <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists are not our enemy.'' Later today, however, a statement issued in the name of a rebel leader, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON>, declared the insurgents were in a `` state of war.'' `` We advise the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to prepare a plan for the evacuation of its nationals as the impotent <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration may not be able to ensure their safety,'' said the statement distributed to news organizations. `` We appeal to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to exert pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government to refrain from pursuing any policy or action which may trigger a new Philippine-American War.''

<HEAD>Attorney: Florida Woman Vindicated When Rapist Sentenced in Georgia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The attorney for a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman who lost a rape case because the jury said she `` asked for it'' says the woman is vindicated now that her accused attacker has been sentenced to life in prison in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. But attorney <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty Tuesday to raping and kidnapping a <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> woman, was trying a foolish ploy when he told the judge his plea would prevent the victim from reliving her trauma in court. `` That's like <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> saying he was sorry for trampling a few thousand extra people,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> home. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sentenced Lord, 26, to life in prison for the rape and a concurrent 20-year sentence for kidnapping the woman at a 24-hour banking machine in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, those sentenced to life are eligible to be considered for parole after seven years. Court records show that Lord had reportedly told the victim: `` It's your fault. You're wearing a skirt.'' Lord's attorney, public defender <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> that Lord `` regrets very much what has happened to her.'' Lord was acquitted of rape in October in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. At that time, the jury foreman, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, said jurors believed the woman accusing him, who was wearing a white lace miniskirt without underwear when she was attacked, had `` asked for it. Although Diamond later said he meant she asked for sex and not rape, the acquittal sparked a national controversy. Other jurors then said they were swayed by the woman's calm demeanor in court compared with the emotional testimony of the 24-year-old <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> woman who testified in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> trial that Lord raped her at knifepoint. `` When the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> woman testified, my heart sank,'' said juror <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Medeiros </PERSON>. `` But when the other one testified, she did n't appear to be shaken up Basically, we did n't believe her story.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday night she was `` delighted'' that Lord was finally sentenced. `` There's no remorseful awareness here. I hope his sentence sticks because we know rape offenders do repeat the crime,'' she said. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> contended that Lord's guilty plea came because he heard the <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> woman's testimony before his hearing in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` He knew he did n't stand a chance,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said he had not been able to reach his client with the news of Lord's plea because her phone was out of order. He said, though, that she would be `` very relieved.''

 The evangelist who introduced <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was charged along with a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> minister with lying to a special grand jury. The federal grand jury on Tuesday charged evangelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> with one count of perjury for his testimony about how <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was introduced to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. According to the indictment, on Sept. 24, 1987, he denied taking Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to a <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, hotel to have sex with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. But, the indictment said, on Sept. 20, 1988, he testified that he agreed when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> asked him, `` Get me a woman.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former minister at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was charged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony before the special grand jury. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s testimony focused on a $ 10,000 loan he made to former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> that later went to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. The payment was made Nov. 1, 1984, before the former church secretary received $ 265,000 in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds in exchange for her silence about her 1980 sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> motel room. `` We do n't expect any further PTL-related indictments from this grand jury,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. He would n't elaborate. The indictments were issued about three hours after <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former second in command at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, testified to the federal grand jury. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty in August to fraud and conspiracy for his role in the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> affair, had no comment as he left the courthouse. Late Tuesday, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s attorneys filed a motion asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> to reduce <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s sentence because of his cooperation with prosecutors. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $ 200,000. His plea agreement enables the former Assemblies of God official to remain free until federal authorities no longer require his cooperation. According to prosecutors, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> had one of his assistants deliver $ 10,000 in an envelope to former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, who handed over the money to Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> during a meeting at a church in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in November 1984. During his two appearances before the special <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> grand jury, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> had asked him for a $ 10,000 loan, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the panel he could not remember where he got the money, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Tuesday. His secretary, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, said he was taping a Christmas TV special in the mountains. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>'s number was n't listed in the <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> telephone directory, so attempts to reach him were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is serving a 45-year term in a federal prison in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> after being convicted Oct. 5 of fraud and conspiracy. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is appealing the conviction, but a panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to free <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> on bond while the appeal was prepared. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was accused of bilking followers who sent him $ 158 million for partnerships in the ministry entitling them to annual lodging guarantees. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> diverted $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to buy expensive homes, cars, jewelry and vacations.

<TEXT>
 It's been six years since <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> cheered at a football game or attended classes, but there's a piece of her high school days she has n't let go She's still fighting to be reinstated in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. She was thrown out of the organization as a senior after she gave birth while unmarried, allegedly for not upholding membership criteria of character and leadership. Now 23 and married, her case finally has reached a federal courtroom in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The non-jury trial opened Tuesday with her taking the stand, claiming discrimination by <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> officials. Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> said she kept up the fight `` because I thought I was right.'' `` As far as I was concerned,'' she said, `` I still had the character and leadership that was necessary for membership, whether I was a married mother or an unwed mother.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> sued in early 1984 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court to regain her membership in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The school district is about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> said teachers told her the two weeks of classes she missed after having her baby affected her leadership abilities. The faculty took the action after giving her the opportunity to resign, an option she refused. Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> testified honor society faculty advisers at her school told her their decision `` would have been different'' if she had been married. She said school officials refused to answer when she asked them if she'd have been dismissed had she obtained an abortion. In his opening statement to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said the school district treated his client differently than it would have treated a male honor student. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> tried to call as a witness a former <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> student who had been allowed to remain a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> even though he got a girl pregnant. But <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> would not allow the man to testify, saying that case occurred two years after Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> had been dismissed. The judge said Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON>'s lawsuit might have affected the board's decision. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsch </PERSON>, the attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> schools, attempted to show membership in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was not important to Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Munsch </PERSON> questioned Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> about missing an honor society function in favor of cheerleading practice. She said dismissal from the society did not prevent Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> from attending college or receiving scholarships. Mrs. <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> testified she enrolled in college but withdrew after one day because her child took up too much time. She also said she never applied for scholarships or financial aid.

 Thieves would smell something other than the sweet, pine aroma of Christmas if they were to take a tree from this city's park. Their olfactory senses would sniff the odious odor of skunk. After several trees in a park were stolen during the Christmas season two years ago, public works employees last year began spraying the remaining trees with a special mixture of skunk oil and fox urine, public works Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannenberg </PERSON> said Tuesday. The commercial product has an odor very much like a skunk's and can last on cloth and carpeting for weeks, if not months, <PERSON> Dannenberg </PERSON> said. The mixture is extremely potent in an enclosed area, he said. `` You ca n't even smell it going on the trees, but once you bring it inside a heated room, it does start to stink,'' he said. `` We sprayed it on a bush and brought it in the office to test it out and got the thing back outside in a hurry.'' Since the spraying began, the city has had no reports of tree thefts from parks during the Christmas season, he said. A company in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said this week that it has begun marketing such a spray to cemeteries, cities, ski areas, landscape companies and private landowners.

<TEXT>
 A truck bomb exploded during rush hour today in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing at least 23 people and injuring about 1,000 near a building housing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s federal police force, reports said. Several stores were destroyed, and police appealed for anyone in the area with picks and shovels to help search through rubble for survivors. Cries for help could be heard beneath some of the ruins, according to radio reports. The explosion left a crater 15 feet deep and 30 feet across, and it damaged or dstroyed 60 cars. A car located 10 feet from the bomb's crater had the roof flattened, and a body was hanging from a window. The owner of a hardware store cried out in agony when he saw the bodies of his wife and daughter brought out of the rubble. Only his little girl's patent leather shoes were visible beneath the bloody sheet covering her. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on drug traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nation's city's in an effort to stop the government from extraditing suspected traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The explosion occurred less than 24 hours after the government said a bomb placed aboard a Colombian airliner had caused it to crash shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> last month, killing all 107 people aboard. Authorities believe the drug traffickers also may have been responsibile for that bomb. Also today, a reputed Colombian drug dealer who is a nephew of one of the nation's drug kingpins was reportedly arrested in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The truck, which was rigged with dynamite, exploded in front of the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s federal investigations police, the radio reports said. The bomb damaged the headquarters and several nearby stores. The blast occurred at 7:30 a.m., after the headquarters had opened for the day. An hour later, firefighters still were trying to control fires amid the remains of stores, and columns of smoke rose over the downtown area. The Colombian radio networks <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> were reporting from the scene of the bombing and quoted police officials there on the number of fatalities. In a live broadcast interview with <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, Health Minister <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said about 1,000 people had been treated hospitals for bomb blast injuries. The police department, known as the DAS, is where many foreigners usually line up at this time of year to get authorization to leave the country for Christmas vacations. However, it was not known immediately if any foreigners were among the victims of the explosion. The foreigners must get clearance from th DAS, which determines whether they face any criminal charges in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The building is near a plaza that is normally filled with fruit and candy vendors in the morning and scores of people walking to work. The goverment of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on the nation's cocaine cartels after Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader, was assassinated on Aug. 18. As part of the crackdown, the government has been extraditing drug suspects wanted on charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug traffickers have responded with a nationwide bombing campaign. More than 200 attacks have killed 29 people and wounded 238. Hours after the report on the plane bombing Tuesday, a judge investigating drug traffickers was assassinated, the fourth judge killed in 15 weeks. Judge <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> was shot and killed while strolling through <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the base of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country's largest cocaine cartel. In June, <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> ordered destroyed 770 pounds of cocaine and five drug processing laboratories seized by police in <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>, 175 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. He also looking into the massacre of 43 people in <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION> on Nov. 11, 1988. The government blamed a paramilitary assassination team financed by drug traffickers. Authorities investigating the plane crash said that a bomb had been placed inside the passenger area of Avianca Flight 203 that exploded Nov. 27. Colombians reacted with shock and fear to the official report of the airplane bombing, which caused the highest death toll from a single attack in the wave of terrorism. In <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, police said today that <PERSON> Severo </PERSON> `` Junior'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, reputedly one of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s leading drug barons, has been arrested in southern <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed reports in the French-language Tribune de Geneve that the 30-year-old nephew of Colombian kingpin, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, 39, was arrested Nov. 29. The elder <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is considered one of the top 12 Colombian drug dealers sought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has been indicted five times in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on a variety of drug charges. The spokesman declined to give further details.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military support for forces loyal to <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could bring on a civil war, said the son of that country's former leader. `` If the American government brings in firepower to support the Aquino government, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be at war with us,'' <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told columnist <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in an interview published today in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided air cover last Friday for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military against mutinous soldiers. `` The logical extreme if pushed to the limits is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> lands forces and involves itself in our battle. Let there be no mistake. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will find itself at war with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' he said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is our fight,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` The man in the street has intense resentment towards <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airplanes overflying him. It could push what is now still considered an uprising into full-scale civil war. `` If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> comes in to mediate, OK. But, if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> tries to intervene between one group and another _ and, remember, the rebels are loyal to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ our country will kill the Americans and each other and violence will escalate,'' he said. Mutinereers last week launched the strongest attempt yet to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration, which has been widely criticized as indecisive and inept. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took over after <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in 1986. Although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has defended <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' democratically elected leader, the son of the late <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> insisted on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' today that the anti-Aquino faction could be described as pro-American. `` It's been quite ironic that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has used its military might against them,'' he said. `` It was a dangerous precedent to begin with, which I think was a serious mistake in judgment on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s part,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` It will be evident in years to come. The wave of anti-Americanism that has derived from that move may be felt for years to come,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Construction is expected to begin next year on an ecumenical center to house nuns now living in a controversial convent outside the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders said today. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON>, its executive director, said their discussions this week with Roman Catholic primate Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> archbishop, Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON>, showed a firm commitment to complete the center. `` The decision to proceed was irreversible,'' <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON> said at a news conference held at the offices of Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> after the delegation met with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The group said it has designated a Polish citizen to act as its permanent representative to maintain relations between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Jewish community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They said he would be the first `` permanent link'' between American Jews and Poles in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the outbreak of World War II. The delegation agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders to help formulate `` programs that will educate Catholics about Jews on the local parish level.'' <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON> said the delegation from the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> delegation came to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to acquaint itself with the dramatic political changes in the country under its new Solidarity-led government and to talk about relations between Jews and Polish Catholics. Besides meeting <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON>, they had talks with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON>. Polish-Jewish relations were strained this year when the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> indicated it would renege on a 1987 promise to move the convent housing 14 <ORGANIZATION> Carmelite </ORGANIZATION> nuns from just outside the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> fence to the proposed ecumenical center for prayer and education. A small group of American Jews led by Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> entered the convent grounds as a protest and were removed by construction workers. A subsequent sermon by <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> was viewed by many Jews as containing anti-Semitic language. But in recent months a <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement upholding the agreement to move the nuns and conciliatory talks between <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> and Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> appear to have repaired most of the damage from the incidents. <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON> stressed the need to improve future relations instead of dwelling on past injuries. <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON> were critical of <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON> said his actions had caused `` terrible damages to all of the objectives close to the American Jewish community and the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, not to mention the local Jewish community.'' They said it was important for Poles to understand that <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> was acting only on his own account and was not representing `` any important segment of the American Jewish community.'' `` In a democratic society, people at the margin can never be controlled in what they say or do. All you can do is make sure they remain at the margins,'' said <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON>. The Jewish leaders gave the new Solidarity government high marks for its commitment to fight anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where only a few thousand Jews remain from a pre-war community of about 3.5 million, and its efforts to democratize Polish society and address its economic problems. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new leaders `` are clear about their desire to relegate anti-Semitism to the margins of Polish society,'' said <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON>. `` We have to recognize the mistakes of the past, and the harm and pain they have caused, learn from them, and then move forward,'' said <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON>.

 It was more painful than she expected, but the woman who gave up part of her liver for her baby girl in the nation's first living donor liver transplant says she would do it again. `` I feel real good,'' <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Tuesday during her first public appearance since she and her daughter, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, underwent surgery Nov. 27. `` I do n't feel like a ` first,''' she said. `` I feel like any parent who is looking out for the best interests of her child.'' `` There was a little more pain than I expected,'' added Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 29. `` But this was our best option for <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> suffered from biliary atresia, an often-fatal congenital liver disorder. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> remained in serious but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>. `` She still has a lot of hurdles to cross,'' but the piece of liver transplanted from her mother has shown no signs of rejection, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>, director of pediatric services at the hospital. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told reporters she'd seen her 21-month-old daughter several times since the weekend, when she had recovered enough to visit <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> for the first time since the operation. Much of their time together has been spent sharing books and getting <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> to play with her toys, said the fourth-grade teacher from <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will be discharged before the weekend, said <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>. There is a 50 percent chance <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> will be released in time for Christmas, although she will have to remain near the hospital for a time, he said. `` The liver is still not functioning perfectly,'' <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said. `` Right now, she's a little yellow. But all other functions have pretty much fallen into place.'' Another pioneering transplant patient, a woman who was given a heart, liver and kidney, has been upgraded to serious condition and taken off a ventilator three days after her historic surgery. Doctors said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Archbald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was responding well following the 21 -LCB- - hour operation that began Saturday at <LOCATION> Presbyterian-University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> The next living donor transplant candidate probably will arrive in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in January, <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said, and as many as eight of the operations could be performed through February. The second child scheduled for the procedure probably will not have the operation. Sixteen-month-old <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, who arrived at the hospital Friday, is too ill to be a good candidate for the operation, <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said. `` She is every bit as malnourished as an Ethiopian refugee,'' he said. `` She's a worse physical candidate than she was'' when doctors first examined her last Friday. If she recovers, doctors probably will use a cadaver liver if one becomes available, <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A judge ordered five <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> lawyers to jail because they refused to testify about the source of fees they received in a 1987 drug case, but a federal appeals court temporarily halted the order. A hearing before the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled for Dec. 13. The lawyers refused to testify Tuesday before a federal grand jury about fees they received for defending methamphetamine makers convicted on drug charges in federal court in <LOCATION> Muskogee </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> ordered the lawyers jailed for contempt. Hours later, after an emergency session, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> stayed the contempt citations and ordered the men freed on their own recognizance until an appeal could be heard. The men claim fee information is a privileged communication between attorney and client. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> disagreed. `` The attorney-client privilege shields only those communications made for the purpose of securing legal advice,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> wrote in the court order. `` Matters involving the payment of fees and the identity of clients are not generally privileged.'' The federal government is investigating <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> nightclub owner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coltharp </PERSON>'s alleged connection to the methamphetamine lab in <LOCATION> Beggs </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. Federal prosecutors allege <PERSON> Coltharp </PERSON> may have paid the attorneys' fees for the convicted lab crew. The lawyers are <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Echols </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> McConathy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. None is accused of any impropriety and none is the target of the grand jury inquiry, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. In his court order, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said the fact that the men are not the target of the investigation means they can not claim protection under the Fifth Amendment. `` Nothing in the circumstances before this court demonstrates that compliance with the subpoenas as to the payment of fees ... would in any way convey the substance of any confidential communication,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> wrote.

 The fate of a Hispanic policeman accused of manslaughter in the shooting of a black motorcyclist was in the hands of the jury today, almost 11 months after the killing sparked three days of race riots. The multi-ethnic jury _ two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic whites _ began deliberations today after almost seven weeks of jury selection and testimony closely followed by the city's residents. Deliberations began at 9:50 a.m. after the jury received last-minute instructions from <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>. Colombian-born Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. Police and community relations officials have geared up for possible renewed rioting if <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is acquitted. However, they said the presence of two blacks on the jury _ along with extensive live broadcasts of testimony and arguments _ may have defused tensions in neighborhoods that have exploded four times this decade after police violence against blacks. During final arguments, prosecutors said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> had no excuse for shooting <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> as the bike sped up an <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> street while fleeing a squad car. `` It's real hard to believe a police officer could do something so stupid,'' Chief Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` That this man, on January 16th, intentionally pulled the trigger and wiped out two human beings.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> countered by accusing the state of trying to make <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> a scapegoat to ease racial tensions. `` He's sort of like a pawn caught up in forces beyond his control,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said defense testimony showed <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was about to be run down by the motorcycle when he fired. `` This man discharged his gun for one reason only _ because he thought he was going to be run over, because he thought he was going to be killed.'' If convicted, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> could be sentenced to a maximum 30 years on each manslaughter count. Jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began Nov. 15. The trial opened Oct. 23, but it took more than three weeks to seat a jury. The shooting occurred on <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> began a week of celebration leading up to the Super Bowl. Within an hour after the shooting, a mob gathered at the scene in the predominantly black <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles. By the time the violence ended three days later, one looter had been shot to death, 11 people were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhoods. It was the fourth such riot in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the 1980s. The first occurred in 1980 after an all-white jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> acquitted a group of <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> policemen accused of beating black insurance executive <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON> to death. In 1982, a riot broke out when <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> entered an <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> video arcade and shot and killed <PERSON> Nevell </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was black. Two years later, violence broke out again when <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> was acquitted by an all-white jury.

<HEAD>Businessmen To Give $6 Million to High School for College Scholarships</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Five businessmen say they are establishing a $ 6 million college scholarship fund for graduates of the 200-student <ORGANIZATION> Winona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a private Roman Catholic school. `` We wanted to motivate students to try to use more of the potential we think they all have,'' said one of the businessmen, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kierlin </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> graduate and president of <LOCATION> Winona </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fastenal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` One of my pet theories as I've gotten older is that no one performs to 100 percent of their ability,'' <PERSON> Kierlin </PERSON> said `` It would be really great if some of the <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> students got a better chance to go to a little bit better college than they might otherwise aspire to.'' The businessmen also are giving $ 2 million for construction of an indoor athletic facility for the school in southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The gifts come one year after they gave more than $ 5 million for teachers' salaries and other expenses. The latest gift means that all current and future <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> students could receive money for part or all of their college expenses. The scholarship fund was in part a reaction to a teacher's observation that many of her students worked after school, said <PERSON> Kierlin </PERSON>, who with four <ORGANIZATION> Fastenal </ORGANIZATION> founders arranged for the gift from the proceeds of a recent stock sale `` We believe in the work ethic, too, but not necessarily during the school year,'' <PERSON> Kierlin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Fastenal </ORGANIZATION> sells threaded fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. This year's 39 seniors will share about $ 50,000, but subsequent larger classes will share about $ 125,000. Educators and philanthropy watchers said the gifts would be remarkable for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges, and is unheard of for a high school. `` Eight million dollars is extraordinary, astounding,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, high school consultant for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which runs the largest private school system in the country and the nation's seventh largest school system of any kind. `` But what's important is that the money is not being given just to the school, but to students,'' <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has approved legislation to protect the health and safety of more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. The bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in a major city, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Display </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> unions and occupational safety and health groups. The bill, approved Tuesday, mandates that VDT operators at city agencies be given a 15-minute break whenever they are required to work at a terminal for more than two consecutive hours. Under the law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions _ including pregnancy _ would be allowed to obtain transfers. Some studies have suggested prolonged VDT exposure increases risk of miscarriage. The bill also mandates that lighting and furniture be adjusted to prevent eye strain and repetitive strain injury to hands and other parts of the body affected by prolonged VDT use. `` We hope <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s legislation will set a national precedent for protecting these workers not only from repetitive strain injuries, but from eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and for pregnant women, from hazards that may lead to miscarriage,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, coordinator of the VDT Coalition.

He and the priest were separated from the Salvadorans. `` Even handcuffed, blindfolded and made to stand like that for hours, I believe we received preferential treatment,'' he said with a wry smile. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who spent most of the last three years in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said the Salvadoran government is increasing reprisals against church workers because they witnessed the effects of recent bombing in the capital city on civilians and because officials insist they are aiding the enemy. `` The government basically has accused these parishes of collaborating with the guerrillas.

 A leading drug trafficker in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whose uncle helps run the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has been arrested in a raid on a luxury hotel in southern <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, police said today. A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed reports in the French-language Tribune de Geneve that <PERSON> Severo </PERSON> `` Junior'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, 30, was arrested Nov. 29. The spokesman refused to give further details. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedel </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities had not received any extradition requests for <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, described by news reports as the top Colombian drug trafficker in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and No. 6 in the international cocaine mafia hierarchy. He is said to be the nephew of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, the reputed head of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. The elder <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is one of the top 12 Colombian drug dealers sought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has been indicted five times in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on a variety of drug charges.

 The glamour is fading from the computer industry at the close of the 1980s, tarnishing one of the most remarkable success stories of American business. The computer industry has behaved more like the auto or steel businesses this year, with numerous layoffs and other job reductions. While sales continue to rise, the single-digit growth is a comedown for an industry that was accustomed to bounding gains early in the decade. The latest evidence came Tuesday, when <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest computer company, announced it would cut 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs without layoffs because of slow growth in its home market. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and independent analysts cite several reasons, including an economic slowdown and sluggish capital spending by American companies. But one of the biggest factors is that computer makers have worked their way out of sales. They have made machines so cheap and powerful that customers no longer need to shell out millions of dollars to get a job done. They can get by with spending a tenth or a hundredth as much. There are some winners in this transformation: the makers of personal computers and engineering `` workstations,'' such as <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The losers are companies that get most of their profit from bigger, costlier computers, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. All those companies have cut jobs this year, through layoffs or voluntary resignations and retirements Their machines ca n't match personal computers for the combination of low price and high speed. Personal computers wo n't take over entirely. Big mainframe computers remain irreplaceable for jobs such as controlling access to vast reservoirs of data and handling complex computing jobs that ca n't be split up among several smaller machines. Minicomputers, which lie between mainframes and personal computers, also have a valuable role in many corporations. But more and more, personal computers are doing jobs that once were the exclusive reserve of bigger machines. `` The little guys are just creeping up everywhere and they're stealing their way into niches all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst All this is good for customers but bad for traditional computer makers. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is a major factor in the personal computer market but makes very thin profit margins in that business, in contrast to its fat profits from its dominant market position in mainframe computers. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> is in a similar bind. This year, it introduced a speedy computer workstation to compete with companies like <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>. The machine is so fast it threatens to cannibalize <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s own sales of its bread-and-butter Vax large-computer line. The danger to mainframes and minicomputers was obscured early in the decade by the industry's overall growth. With expansion slowing, the threat from personal computers is clearly delineated. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its business was stronger in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One reason may be that personal computers are not as popular abroad. Once PCs catch on abroad, they may sap strength from those markets for bigger computers as they did in this country, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellomy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> analyst. <PERSON> Bellomy </PERSON>'s company is projecting an 8 percent increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of computers next year, about even with 7 percent this year but far less than the 30 percent a year in 1982 through 1984. International Data projects the strongest growth in PCs and workstations, 11 percent; and the weakest in mainframes, up less than 1 percent <ORGANIZATION> Cahners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes several trade magazines, is more pessimistic. It projects overall computer industry growth of 2.7 percent this year and less than 2 percent in 1990. The scope of the difficulties is reflected in job figures. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, computer industry employment in September was just under 420,000. While that is about the same as the last few years, it is down sharply from 471,000 in September 1984, the industry's last boom year. In its announcement Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said that in addition to cutting 10,000 jobs through retirement and separation incentives, it would buy back $ 4 billion of its own stock. It also said it would set aside $ 2.3 billion from its pretax profit to pay for the job cuts and related steps.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged today to permit the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> woman described as `` an unconscious shell.'' But a state lawyer said the woman's parents have no constitutional right to order such action. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the parents of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, said if the permanently unconscious woman `` was lucid for a moment and could come before this court,'' she would ask that a tube in her stomach providing food and water be removed. `` Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in this case,'' <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> said. `` She would choose liberty.'' But Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> said the parents have no constitutional right to precipitate their daughter's death. `` In this extraordinary situation, the decision should be made by a judicial body,'' <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> said, referring to a state court ruling that the feeding tubes must be retained. Solicitor General <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's top courtroom lawyer, supported <PERSON> Presson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> urged the court to give states `` wide latitude that reflects reasonably the wishes'' of their citizens `` in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing situation.'' There is no constitutional right to choose to die in such cases that overrides a state's determination to require continued food and water for unconscious patients, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said. The justices, preparing for their first `` right-to-die'' decision, asked extensive questions of the lawyers. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked whether a lower court that required the life-support treatment for Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> decided the case based on `` the best interests of the patient?'' `` I have been concerned because it's not clear what standard'' the lower court set, she said. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, `` You presume there is a liberty to die without clear and convincing evidence'' of the patient's wishes. In his presentation to the justices, <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> said of Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, `` She is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for the rest of her life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, 32, has been in what doctors call a persistent vegetative state for almost seven years. Her parents, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, are asing the court to let them order removal of a surgically implanted tube providing her with food and water. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled doctors may not remove the tube. Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> suffered severe brain damage in a Jan. 11, 1983, car crash. She lies in a hospital bed, her body rigid, her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw shapes. Doctors say she can not experience thoughts or emotions, and that her condition is irreversible. But Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> can breathe on her own and has periods when her eyes are open and move randomly. The surgically implanted tube could keep her alive for 30 years or more, doctors say. Without it, she would soon die of starvation or dehydration. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, a sheet-metal worker, allowed doctors to implant the tube four weeks after his daughter's accident. He said he was told he could have it removed after a year if there were no improvement in her condition. The right-to-die issue captured national headlines in 1976 when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed the family of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe. Ms. <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, in a similar coma-like state, continued to be fed through a tube and lived for nine more years. American courts since generally have permitted removal of life-sustaining treatment for such patients, relying on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> opinion that artificially supplied nutrition and hydration are medical treatments. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> estimates 70 percent of Americans at some time will be involved in a decision about whether to provide life-sustaining medical care for themselves or family members. Forty-one states, including <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, have so-called living will laws that allow people to pre-authorize the termination of life-sustaining treatment. But <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s living-will law, which does not allow for removal of feeding tubes, was not in effect when Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> was injured. Her parents said she had told them she would not want to be kept alive by artificial means if ever rendered incompetent. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said such statements fall well short of the `` clear and convincing'' evidence needed to prove her real intent. `` We choose to err on the side of life, respecting the rights of incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severely diminished quality of life,'' the state court said. Even if the justices decide there is no constitutional right to die, or that it can not be exercised by a parent or guardian of an incompetent person, states will remain free to let doctors remove life-sustaining treatment from certain patients. But such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it more difficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration argues in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief that even a competent adult does not have an unlimited right to refuse food and water. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said states have always prohibited attempted suicide, and noted some make it a crime to help a suicide. The government said that even if a right to die exists, it does not extend to an incompetent person and does not outweigh `` the state's profound interest in preserving human life.'' Anti-abortion groups also expressed support for the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> court decision. It limits the privacy right that undergirds the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 decision legalizing abortion. Religious groups are split over the issue. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and others say a victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Cruzans </ORGANIZATION> could jeopardize the rights of the elderly or people with severe handicaps. The <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and others argue that families should be free of unwarranted state intrusion when making such decisions. The case is <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1503.

 The Communist leadership will soon present a new government that meets opposition demands for more non-Communist members, the nation's top opposition leader said today. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said at a news conference that Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> will present a list of names for the Cabinet to leaders of the pro-democracy movement for approval before the list is made public. He refused to disclose any details of the intense negotiations to include more non-Communists, as demanded by the nation's pro-democracy movement <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> told the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> that he had accepted from Civic Forum, the leading opposition group, a list of possible Cabinet candidates. He said he will consult with other official political parties on Thursday, then meet again with Civic Forum, probably on Friday, and give them his proposals. It was not known whether either side had set special conditions for the opposition to approve the Cabinet. The agreement on the new government represents the latest of several dramatic concessions the Communists have made in the last two months in the face of the growing pro-democracy movement. These include a loosening of travel restrictions, the resignation of the Communist leadership of <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and the end of the Communists constitutionally guaranteed hold on power. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> spoke after holding his first talks with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, who he said agreed with the opposition's position that `` young, able people and experts who are not discredited'' should be brought into the government After his 75-minute meeting with <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other opposition leaders met briefly with <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who is trying to form a new Cabinet after a coalition government he named Sunday ran into fierce popular resistance. The opposition spurned that government because it brought in just five non-Communists and left Communists in control of all key ministries. The opposition has threatened a general strike on Monday if a new federal government is not named by Sunday. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> will consult Thursday with representatives of other, increasingly independent official parties on forming a new government. The opposition will then learn the names of the new cabinet Friday. Both the government and the opposition have refused to disclose details of their negotiations. Opposition sources said the talks envisage some form of power-sharing before the free elections the opposition wants held by July. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who only a month ago was a banned playwright reviled in the official press, said <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> admitted during their unprecedented meeting that his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> faces `` deeply rooted mistrust,'' and must change. But <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> told the opposition he has trouble convincing some regional party leaders of this, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> requested a second meeting Thursday with cameras from state-run television present. The opposition leader did not say whether such a session would take place, or whether it would be carried live on television. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> also assured the opposition that the party's unpopular paramilitary force, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, has been completely disarmed by the army and will probably be incorporated into the armed forces. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> also admitted that the Czechoslovak secret police `` has lost all its purpose for internal matters,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. He did not elaborate. As the talks between <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> broke up, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief could be heard telling actor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knazko </PERSON>, an opposition leader in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, `` the most important thing now is to calm people's emotions so that we do n't have a food rationing system tomorrow.'' This appeared to be a reference to the possibility of economic chaos if the political crisis is not resolved soon. The opposition scored a victory Tuesday when a parliamentary commission named <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Communist boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> as politically responsible for a police crackdown on peaceful students Nov. 17. The commission recommended that both men be stripped of their last political posts as parliamentary deputies. But the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> as saying today: `` I fully reject political responsibility for the events of Nov. 17, 1989, because the political decision was not to act against the participants of the demonstration. Any other statement is not true and is guided by political ambitions.'' That crackdown spurred a week of enormous unrest that culminated in the ouster of <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and some of his allies. The naming of politicians and police held responsible for the crackdown was a chief demand of the striking students who started <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s massive pro-democracy movement rolling just two weeks ago. Also on Tuesday, a cabinet was named to rule the Czech region of the country that left Communists in the minority for the first time since 1948. This could serve as a model for a new federal government to replace the 21-member federal Cabinet named on Sunday. That government brought in just five non-Communists and left Communists in control of all key ministries. The opposition has threatened a general strike on Monday if a new federal government is not named by the weekend.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> overruled a staff recommendation when he ordered a preliminary inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing against former <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a spokesman said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section recommended against considering whether an independent counsel should investigate the allegations of political favoritism and perjury against <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. `` That decision was reversed by the attorney general after his further personal review,'' said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, confirming an account in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> dismissed suggestions that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered the additional inquiry to avoid charges from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he had scuttled an investigation of a man with whom he sat in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet. `` He was concerned that the issues reviewed needed further investigation,'' the spokesman said. `` He was n't convinced by the public integrity section's point of view.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision, made last Saturday, triggered a 60-day preliminary inquiry to determine if he should seek court appointment of an independent counsel, formerly known as a special prosecutor, to conduct a full criminal investigation. Democratic congressmen alleged last month that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> awarded <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> grants on the basis of political favoritism and lied under oath during congressional hearings last spring. They cited testimony <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> gave to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee that he did not have `` hands-on'' involvement in the award of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants to politically connected developers. The 19 lawmakers, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, triggered procedures under the independent counsel law by forwarding their allegations to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. In response to the lawmakers' request, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disclosed Monday that he had ordered the preliminary inquiry. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing but twice refused to give additional testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers have contended that the lawmakers had not provided the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with any `` specific and credible'' evidence that their client committed a crime. The public integrity section, applying that standard as outlined in the independent counsel law, apparently agreed with that view. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers expressed confidence that the preliminary inquiry would not result in the appointment of an independent counsel.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Five Suspected Members of Right-Wing Hit Squad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today confirmed the arrest of five suspected members of a rightist group that had planned bombings and other terrorist acts. Human rights activists expressed concern that the arrests might be part of an attempt to divert attention from recent allegations of death squads within the ranks of the national police force. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a private group led by anti-apartheid activists, said the government might try to convey the impression that fanatical right-wingers, rather than elements of the security forces, were the main culprits in a series of unsolved attacks on government opponents. Police said the five men were arrested Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area and that they ranged in age from 28 to 40. Police refused to disclose their names, saying that could jeopardize the prospects for further arrests. They said a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was seized during the investigation. A police statement said the men were being held for questioning about various bombings and other terrorists acts involving a right-wing group but gave no further details. Local newspapers quoted unidentified police sources as saying the men apparently belonged to a group that had broken away from the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. s the pear-shaped stringed instrument to promote Arabic music around the world, and to bridge a culture gap. But he believes that one of his biggest tasks in life is to instill a love of Arabic music among youngsters who have been seduced by Western rock and disco music and preserve a rich artistic heritage. `` It's a shame,'' he said in an interview. `` We have such great music, but the younger generations never heed it.'' <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said that for Arabs to neglect their traditional music is to ignore an important aspect of their cultural identity. `` Music is part of the cultural identity of any people. It's not something you can borrow from others,'' he said. `` Music is not just entertainment. It's a source of spiritual and moral uplifting.'' <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>, 59, believes Arabic music is now in a state of crisis, which he attributes to `` cultural backwardness.'' As director of musical affairs at the Culture Ministry in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, he has devoted 16 years to promoting Arabic music as part of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s educational system and culture. <PERSON> Bashire </PERSON> established a ballet and music school for children to study and learn to play instruments and the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Melody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> for teen-agers. Three years ago, he formed the al-Bayariq ensemble, a 28-member youth group, to develop young people's interest in authentic Arabic music and to help preserve centuries-old songs that have begun to disappear because of the `` ugly thrust'' of modern music. It is led by his youngest son, <PERSON> Omer </PERSON>, 20. `` It's not just a source of pride, but an investment in our cultural future,'' <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't encourage young people to play these instruments, our traditional music will die and these instruments will only be found in museums.'' <PERSON> Al-Bayariq </PERSON> brings together the oud, qanun, santur and joza, all stringed instrumemnts, as well as the tablah, a small drum, and the riqq, a frame drum with jingles akin to a tambourine. The oud is a six-stringed instrument, shaped like a lute. <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> believes the oud originated in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The instrument has been seen on stone carvings dating back 2,000 years. From Arabia, the oud made its way to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, possibly in the Moorish conquest of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and from it evolved the lute. The qanun is a zither-like instrument. The violin-like joza has only one string that gives a strong, high pitch. It is played resting on the leg rather than nestling under the chin. The santure is something like a qanun, but its strings are played with sticks rather than a bow. The instruments used by the ensemble are specially made for the group by elderly craftsmen in a workshop set up by <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>. The ensemble has performed in several foreign countries, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and all over the Arab world. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the youngsters performed at the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to standing ovations. `` Now we've built a solid base, I hope these kids will stick to their instruments, pioneering the way for others to follow,'' <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> said. Arabic music has largely been ignored in the West because of its complex melodies and ornamental flourishes that make it difficult to grasp. But artists such as <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> are increasingly bridging the cultural gap. Critics hail him as a creative and supreme master of his instrument, whose music springs from the authentic tradition of Arabian music. Foreign critics say <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> is notable for being able to project the emotions of Arabic music, often lost to the occidential ear, to non-Arabs. `` He stretches the understanding of music to the limit,'' one European critic wrote. `` To listen to him takes as much intellectual energy and attention as listening to the discourse of a sage.'' His playing is rooted in classical Arab forms but is largely improvisational. Some critics have found it resembles progressive jazz in many ways. <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> has elevated the oud to solo instrument status after centuries of having been used to accompany Arab singers. For one thing, he added six more strings, pairing them with the others, to produce a fuller sound and melodic flexibility. He discovered his gift for music when he was 6 years old while listening to his mother singing lullabies to his younger brothers. She also played several traditional instruments. `` She was my first idol. She breathed the love of music into me,'' he said. His father made ouds and <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>'s brother also plays the instrument. In his ministry office, crowded with musical instruments, records and tapes, he spends two to three hours a day playing. No one is allowed to interrupt him. `` All telephone calls and appointments have to be put off when al-istath -LRB- the master -RRB- is playing, until he finishes his solo performance in his office,'' said his secretary, <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawad </PERSON>, who is also a lyricist and musician.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> administrator was sentenced today to 18 months in state prison for stealing $ 186,000 from the university's Office of Minority and Special Student Affairs. <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> was convicted last month of three felony counts of theft by swindle. He said all the missing money was doled out to needy athletes and other students on instructions from his superiors, who testified they had no knowledge of the payments. <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sentenced him to 18 months in prison on one count, 15 months on the second count and one year and one day on the third count, to run concurrently, said the judge's law clerk, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> will get credit for time already served, nearly four months, <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> to six months at the county workhouse for contempt of court, to be served after the prison sentence. `` The position of trust that Mr. <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> had at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> was violated,'' he said. `` The offenses were committed with a high degree of planning over an extended and lengthy period of time.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> had sought a minimum sentence of 54 months, saying <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> had deceived the very students he was supposed to be counseling and had made false allegations against his colleagues.

 Dec. 4 <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> on the Exxon Valdez captain: Attorneys for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, skipper of the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, have come up with a criminal defense that is, well, interesting. As a result of the tanker running aground March 24 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil, the captain faces three felony and three misdemeanor charges in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> Here's his attorneys' pitch: Because <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> radioed in to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that his tanker was leaking oil, he had incriminated himself, presumably without aid of counsel or having been advised of his `` Miranda'' rights. Do n't like that one? Try this one: Because of state and federal laws that grant immunity to people who report oil spills, the fact that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> radioed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that the tanker had run aground and was `` leaking some oil'' made him an oil-spill reporter, and therefore subject to immunity. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> a whistle-blower? On whom, himself? Come on!

 Dec. 5 The Clarion-Ledger, <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on garbage disposal and racketeers: Do Americans want to depend on racketeers to take care of their garbage? That's another element of the problem of solid waste disposal that must be considered as landfills are being exhausted and the volume of refuse mounts. Public hearings last month in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> revealed the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> crime families that have long dominated the waste-disposal industry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> through intimidation and murder already have branched out into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. They are expected to look next at the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ and possibly the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The threat is more alarming because it comes at a time when the nation is approaching a crisis on solid waste disposal. The risk to public safety is becoming increasingly clear, particularly as mob muscle can be applied to achieve monopoly control of the industry. Profits in the industry can be enormous. Waste disposal is not a field in which many businessmen are interested. States are fighting back through laws requiring background investigations of waste haulers and landfill operations in an effort to block mob control. However, a cooperative, inter-regional response may be needed, as will some federal assistance. The gangster threat only further underlines the fact that an effective, overall response to the solid waste problem must be implemented _ and soon. Public health is at stake, and if a crunch comes, the public must avoid the additional threat of being at the mercy of the mob.

 Dec. 1 Grants Pass -LRB- <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily Courier on TV news re-creations: Why all the fuss about television networks using dramatic re-creations of news events? In July, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> news touched off a furor by broadcasting a dramatization, with actors, of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s supposed exchange of documents with a Soviet citizen Critics said the sequence blurred the line between reality and dramatics, a line that television news should regard as holy. These folks take television news too seriously. They applauded <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision ... to join <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in promising not to use such dramatizations. Their criticism turned to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which steadfastly refuses to change. More power to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, whose defiant stance proclaims what the so-called critics refuse to admit: that television news is entertainment pure and simple. ... Television spreads the image _ not the word _ better than any other medium, and some images will never die. ... The boob tube can be incredibly amusing, transporting us from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, taking us from <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, moving us from laughter to tears. While <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> continue their impossible quest for a news program beyond the boundaries of entertainment, the rest of us can turn to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, where television news is lauded for what it really is: a nightly half-hour of informative escapism.

Using the professional name <PERSON> Konishiki </PERSON>, he has battled his way to the summit of Japanese sports, recently winning <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most prestigious prize, the Emperor's Cup, and establishing himself as the nation's premier sumo wrestler. The Japanese have greeted <PERSON> Konishiki </PERSON>'s stunning victory with apparent good cheer. He seems to have a natural appeal for his fans _ perhaps because in sheer physical dimensions he bears a striking resemblance to Rockefeller Center. In fact, the vast majority of the crowd attending his championship match rooted for him unashamedly. In commerce and culture, ours is a small world and getting smaller, as the Japanese have obviously come to realize. Let's hope we react with similar equanimity when the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> win the National League East.

<HEAD>Transplant Patients' Cancer Rate To Be Studied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> will conduct a five-year study of the rate at which some people who receive transplanted organs develop cancer. In the process, the $ 5 million study _ funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ may provide clues to the relationship between cancer and viruses and the way in which the body combats those diseases, one official said Tuesday. `` It has broad implications for better understanding of mechanisms that lead to the development of cancer,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>, director of the institute's immunologic monitoring and diagnostic laboratory and a professor of pathology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. About 400 adults and children who have received transplants will be recruited to participate in the study. <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON> said one of the most significant aspects of the study is that researchers will be able to study a large group of people, some of whom they know will develop cancer. It will build on observations made in 1975 by <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> liver transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who discovered when he was at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> that 2 to 3 percent of all transplant recipients developed cancer. The most common malignancies diagnosed among those patients were lymph node cancer, liver cancer and <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, a skin cancer also common among AIDS patients. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, along with Dr. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, also found that the risk of cancer after a transplant increased to 10 percent for patients whose pre-transplant tests showed they did not have antibodies to the Epstein Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis. About 80 percent of those patients become infected with the virus after transplantation, and researchers believe there is some correlation between that and the development of cancer, particularly in the lymph nodes. Researchers also will try to determine why liver transplant recipients whose previous liver was removed because of cancer often develop the cancer again with the new organ. In such patients, the cancer does not show up in other parts of the body. `` We are not even sure if it is the same cancer that returns to the new liver or a new cancer that arises in the liver. Nothing is known about this,'' she said. The return of cancer, <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON> said, must have something to do with a person's immune system after transplantation or the immune defenses within the liver itself. Transplant patients get drugs to suppress their body's natural defenses after surgery to prevent rejection of the new organs, and the drugs also make the patients susceptible to other infections.

<TEXT>
 A federal jury today convicted a 24-year-old man of operating a $ 2 million-a-week cocaine-distribution network in the nation's capital, a verdict that mandates life imprisonment. <PERSON> Rayful </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was found guilty of all seven counts against him after more than four days of deliberations that capped a 12-week trial. Ten co-defendants were convicted of related charges. During the 20 minutes that the verdicts were read, the 11 defendants stood impassively before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>, occasionally glancing down at the floor or shaking their heads slowly as the guilty verdicts mounted. The jury returned an innocent verdict on only one of the 23 counts in the indictment. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, stood stoically throughout the proceeding, his hands folded in front of him and a serious expression on his face. The charges against him included conspiracy to violate narcotics laws, employing persons under 18 to possess and distribute cocaine, traveling across state lines to sell drugs and using a telephone to set up illegal drug deals. Convictions on those counts satisfy a definition of a continuing criminal enterprise, a crime which carries a mandatory life sentence. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s co-defendants, who include an aunt, a sister, a brother and several close friends, were found guilty of assisting him. Prosecutors said at the trial that the drug ring accounted for up to 30 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s cocaine market. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> did not immediately set a sentencing date. The verdicts ended a complex, courtroom drama in which prosecutors depicted <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> as the head of a vast and deadly drug network that took in $ 2 million a week. The trial was unusual from the outset, when the judge ruled that the names of jurors would be kept secret even from himself and lawyers to protect them from possible reprisals. The home of one witness' mother was firebombed during the trial, an informant was shot after being accidentally exposed by the prosecution. The trial was conducted in a courtroom with a bullet-proof plastic shield 1 -LCB- inches thick, and further protection was provided by a metal detector set up for the trial outside the courtroom in which the case was argued. At its peak last summer, prosecutors said, <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> and his cohorts moved up to 440 pounds of cocaine per week into <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The city has experienced more than 400 homicides this year, most of them attributed by police to drug activities. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> was described by prosecutors as a flashy entrepreneur who lavished expensive gifts _ including luxury automobiles _ on friends, family members and loyal lieutenants in his organization. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s lawyers said the government had not proved its case against him. In closing arguments last Thursday, defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> challenged the credibility of prosecution witnesses, saying evidence against some of the co-defendants did not point to <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> as the leader of a drug enterprise. `` There was a lot of testimony from a lot of people who got caught dealing drugs,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` The problem was ... making a connection between that activity and <PERSON> Rayful </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> is charged with additional crimes _ including three counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy counts _ and is expected to face two more trials.

<TEXT>
 Seven months before <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> cast the ninth and deciding vote to ratify the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution in 1788, the governor had 400 copies printed so voting delegates could read it. All were thought to have been lost, until <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Newbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, found one last spring in papers in the vault in the old Town Hall. The vault was filled with papers from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> that the town had given to the historical society. State Archivist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mevers </PERSON> confirmed the document was one of the copies printed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> at the direction of Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` We're 100 percent sure this document was printed in December of 1787,'' <PERSON> Mevers </PERSON> said. The types of paper, the handwriting, ink and print all convinced him of the document's authenticity. Whether <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> would ratify the Constitution was in doubt in the months before the vote. Supporters, called federalists, said a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull the country out of economic recession. Opponents said the Constitution would lay the groundwork for the kind of tyrannical central government they had fought in the Revolution. After months of pro-Constitution lobbying, federalists won ratification with a 57-47 vote in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> on June 21, 1788. <PERSON> Mevers </PERSON> said the document's value is n't certain, and the only way to determine that would be by auction. But <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON> said the historical society in the town of about 1,000 residents plans to keep it. `` We'd like to have it displayed,'' he said. `` We'd like to be able to have people see it, but we do n't have the facility to do that.'' He said it's possible the society could loan the document to the state historical society museum.

<HEAD>Cold Fusion Defense May Affect Tenure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some faculty members at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> are upset that a physicist who publicly supported researchers' claims of achieving cold fusion may win tenure, a newspaper reported today. At <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, where millions of dollars have been spent on research into conventional fusion as a potential energy source, many scientists challenged a report of cold fusion energy, but <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagelstein </PERSON> defended it. Cold fusion was envisioned as a source of limitless energy last spring when <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researcher <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said their experiment fused hydrogen atoms without the high temperatures believed necessary for such a reaction. At a news conference April 14, <PERSON> Hagelstein </PERSON> theorized that a previously unknown nuclear phenomenon was involved in cold fusion, and <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> filed for a patent on potential applications of his ideas. But other <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> physicists scoffed at the idea, and chemists said <PERSON> Hagelstein </PERSON> did not understand that a chemical, rather than physical, reaction might have occurred. Other laboratories were unable to reproduce the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> results. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said it was told by unidentified sources at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> that tenure for <PERSON> Hagelstein </PERSON>, 34, has support in his department of electrical engineering but that the way he got MIT into the cold fusion controversy has become an issue. Critics said it was not so much his theory as the way it was presented _ through the news media rather than submitting it to review by scientists, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Riot police arrested four leftist radicals Wednesday for throwing firebombs to protest the expansion of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s international airport, officials said. Protesters hurled firebombs and bricks at riot police from four 50-foot towers erected at the site by the demonstrators. Police eventually overpowered them with water cannons. Riot police lowered steel cages over the towers to prevent them from hurling more projectiles. About 200 radical opponents of the airport rallied nearby to protest the police action but did not clash with them, the official said. Seven radicals have been arrested since Monday, when about 5,000 riot police began to remove one of 10 huts built illegally on the site of the planned second runway of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said. Eight farmers own land on or near the planned expansion site, refusing to yield it for construction of additional runways to ease congestion. The airport handled 17.24 million passengers in 1988, 4 million more than it was originally designed for, the airport authority said. Forty-eight airlines from 37 countries use the $ 2.5 billion airport, which opened in 1978 with just one runway. By next year, the government plans to build two more runways, one of 8,250 feet and another of 10,560 feet. Anti-government radicals have been supporting the farmers in their battle to keep their land from being taken from them for the new runways. On Monday, Transport Minister <PERSON> Takami </PERSON> <PERSON> Eto </PERSON> became the first government official to apologize for the state's failure to consult adequately with farmers when the airport first was planned 23 years ago.

 The Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has taken a heavy toll in the past two years. Casualties on both sides have mounted as the `` intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ drags on without political solution. More than 820 people have died, according to a tally kept by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. They include 626 Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians and 154 Palestinians slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboration with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence, including 11 soldiers. The Palestinian fatalities include 132 children, says the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in the Occupied Territories. Thousands have been wounded. According to the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees relief programs for Palestinian refugees, nearly 40,000 Palestinians have suffered injuries ranging from tear gas inhalation to beatings and gunshot wounds. The army puts the Palestinian injury total at 8,926. The army spokesman's office says 2,438 Israelis have been wounded, including 1,635 soldiers. Sixty Palestinians have been deported and about 40,000 jailed in the past two years. There are 9,142 in prison now, including 1,562 `` administrative detainees'' held without charge or trial. Both sides have lost economically, too. <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Lev </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hapoalim </ORGANIZATION>, estimated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s economic growth in 1989 was reduced by about one-half percent _ about $ 200 million _ because of business disruptions and trade losses stemming from the uprising The toll in the first year was about $ 600 million, Israeli economists estimated. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the size of the gross national product has shrunk by at least 25 percent, from about $ 1.5 billion in 1987 to about $ 1.125 billion now, <PERSON> Awartani </PERSON> estimated. GNP is a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy. `` People are suffering,'' said <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Awartani </PERSON>, a leading Palestinian economist. `` I'm not optimistic about 1990, either.'' Lev believes the impact on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is decreasing because the economy has more or less adjusted to new realities. He noted, for example, that many companies are hiring Israelis to replace Palestinians, who often missed work because of strikes or other uprising-related problems. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> workers are more expensive, but they produce more so output is rising,'' Lev said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, agriculture, construction and service industries are suffering, <PERSON> Awartani </PERSON> said. The only bright spot is industry. `` Hundreds of factories have sprung up,'' he said. `` Some are cottage industries, but many are real factories employing 20 or 30 people.'' The Palestinian factories are finding a ready market because of the uprising boycott of Israeli-made goods. But <PERSON> Awartani </PERSON> said the fledgling industries will have to worry about quality and price competition if they are going to survive.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ruled out at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit a proposal from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to restrict the superpowers' navies, including removing nuclear weapons from surface warships, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` it was unacceptable to us because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a naval power. We depend upon the seas for contact with all of our allies and with other continents of the world.'' `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a land-based power. But the navy is crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around the world, maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around the world,'' he said. `` It simply is so key and vital to our basic role in world military affairs as well as commercial affairs that we can not consider that,'' the spokesman said, adding that `` I do n't detect any flexibility at this point'' on the issue. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed concern at the weekend summit that his country was surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval power, and even gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a KGB-produced map of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations to hammer home the point. `` He would like to see reductions in the naval forces,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` He gave us the chart, the map. We made some jokes that we'd fill in the blanks and that was about it,'' the White House spokesman added The White House also announced today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is delegating Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to coordinate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including the recently passed $ 938 million in aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met in the Oval Office today with former <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, prime minister from 1983 to 1987 as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said after the meeting that the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit gave `` a further impulse'' to the changes taking place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> was also visiting congressional leaders and receiving an honorary degree from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The White House denied on Tuesday that there was any difference in attitudes toward the Soviets between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who said in a newspaper interview that the Soviets were `` a totalitarian government'' that had not `` changed much in foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his first public comments since returning to the White House from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday, told a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner Tuesday night that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should help spur democratic changes inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> despite persistent differences over Soviet aid to leftist governments in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I look at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> as a hopeful step in a new relationship,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He told the crowd of 600 at a $ 1,000-a-plate dinner for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` We have some differences obviously with ... past performance of the Soviet and regrettably, I'm afraid, in the future.'' `` But we're going to keep on working this. I was up front ... about the destabilizing flow of arms into the region from nations that are receiving Soviet support.'' He acknowledged: `` When you go to a meeting of this nature, there's trepidation.

Some conservatives have expressed unhappiness over the summit, saying that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave the Soviets economic concessions without securing a commitment to keep Moscow-made weapons out of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. At the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed giving <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> observer status at the world's leading economic regulatory body and proposed June as a target date for completing a trade agreement granting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> most-favored-nation status, which would result in an easing of trade barriers.

 All foreign citizens trapped by rebel fighting in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> hotels, including some 280 Americans, have been bused to safety, the White House said today. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is working to help these individuals with their travel plans,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He said the evacuations were completed without incident. `` All Americans were reported safe and we have no reports of injuries,'' he said. `` I'm very encouraged about that,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said earlier when asked if all the Americans were safe. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> today, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a state of national emergency, but it was unclear what additional powers her government would wield with the declaration. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to comment on the emergency declaration, other than to say `` we will take a look at it and see if we have any concerns.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said earlier today that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were trying to determine what the emergency declaration specifically means. `` We're still getting reports on what the state of emergency declaration includes,'' <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said, adding that there had not been any additional requests for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and Philippine authorities said 164 Americans were out safely, and that the evacuation appeared complete. Consular officers met 30 buses at a reception center established at a shopping center near the airport. Some 2,000 foreigners were trapped for four days in hotels by the military coup attempt that had killed at least 77 people. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the drama was decidedly low key Tuesday as the administration sought to avoid language that could further inflame tensions. The administration suggested the plight of the trapped foreigners was not so much a hostage taking as it was the product of the ongoing military revolt against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. To <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, the most disquieting aspect of the situation were statements by some rebels that the Americans might not be released to punish the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its support for the Aquino government. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said there was no indication that Americans had been singled out for mistreatment. Capt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON>, one of the insurgents, reflected the sentiments of rebel hard-liners when he said, `` The intention is not to release Americans.'' `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of our assault, so we hold them liable,'' Yen said. `` It is the responsibility of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government if we take their nationals hostage.'' National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said Tuesday Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had not requested additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military support.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 We must remember that the rebellion is not against the government or the democratic process alone. This is a struggle waged against the very people who had installed this leadership when we established democracy in our country. The people too are the intended victim. Although the government is prepared to deal with this fierce strategy decisively, our people must join us in giving the enemy the final blow. ... They just want to grab power. They do not think whether they will inflict suffering on the Filipino people. How many innocent civilians were killed? They did not think that lives of Filipinos matter. The constant preoccupation is finding ways wherein they can rule and have power. We still remember what martial law was like. Those people we suspect are involved in what is happening now to our country, these same peole believe they are the only ones who have power. During martial law, we did n't have a duly ratified constitution. We did n't have press freedom During those times, when somebody wrote or said something against the government, they were arrested and sometimes even killed. ... I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for democracy. I have lost my husband. In 1983, he was killed. Many of us suffered and until now we have put our lives at stake. You know what happened last Friday when rockets were fired at <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION>. What did these people want? It is very clear that these people want to kill me, to eliminate me, so that they can rule our land. What they have forgotten is that power is not theirs to take. They can not just grab power by killing people. They have to understnd that power belongs to you, my beloved countrymen. Why did I become president? That was because you believed in me. And in spite of all of the coup attempts, you have stuck by me. And I know that I owe my being president to you. I did not think of being president. I just wanted to serve you, I just wanted to restore democracy. I want to respect your rights. I am only asking you to help me. You are my only source of strength to continue our reforms in government. I also depend on you to see for yourself what these people are doing to us. ... Show our enemies that we, the Filipino people, love our coutnry. We do not want these killings. We reject these people whose only concern is their own interest. You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you.

 Cheating in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has forced the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to reschedule a graduate test, cancel an English proficiency test and wipe out the test scores of nearly 3,000 students. <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicosia </PERSON> said it was uncertain if the cheating announced Wednesday was the largest-scale breach of standardized test security ever. But such cases have rarely extended beyond a single class, school or test center. <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had received about 50 letters from Indian students and test center supervisors indicating that students had been able to buy copies of the standardized tests before the administration dates. <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> said it had learned that test materials had been improperly obtained in advance by students for the Oct. 28 Test of English as a Foreign Language. This prompted cancellation of exams at five centers in the <LOCATION> Bangalore </LOCATION> area, affecting 620 students, according to <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION>. The language exam, taken annually by 500,000 students worldwide, including 21,500 Indian students, is designed to evaluate English proficiency in students whose native language is not English. It is used for admission by 3,000 North American colleges and universities. An investigation also found students were able to buy copies of the Graduate Record Examination before taking last month's test. The test is taken primarily by college students to enter graduate school. Most of the approximately 14,000 Indian students who take the <ORGANIZATION> GRE </ORGANIZATION> each year are trying to gain admittance to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> graduate schools. <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION>, which administers standardized tests in 170 countries, said it had canceled the scores of 2,744 of 4,280 test takers for the <ORGANIZATION> GRE </ORGANIZATION> administered Oct. 14 at 17 of 27 Indian test centers. It said it was rescheduling the Dec. 9 <ORGANIZATION> GRE </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to next month.

 <PERSON> Insherah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> sat on the dirt floor of a U.N.-supplied tent Wednesday, talking to relatives and neighbors about her home of 25 years that was destroyed by the Israeli army overnight. In Mrs. <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON>'s case _ as for many of the 244 families whose homes have been demolished by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the two-year <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising _ the sins of a son were behind her troubles. Her youngest son, 26-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, is accused of trying to force a crowded Israeli bus over a cliff in September. Police say <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> also confessed to murdering an Israeli co-worker at a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> construction site and led police to the body. Israeli military officials maintain demolishing or sealing houses is necessary to deter violence. International human rights groups call it collective punishment that violates conventions on the treatment of refugees. Mrs. <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON>, a 55-year-old widow, says it is unfair and ineffective as a deterrent. `` I told them he does n't own anything in the house. It's my house. But they did n't care,'' she said. `` We lost everything. We lost our house. What else do we have to lose?'' she asked. The <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> family pitched the tent next to the ruins of the six-room, two-story house they built in 1964. Living in the house with Mrs. <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> were her three daughters, two older sons and their pregnant wives, and two granddaughters. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> also lived there until his arrest in the bus attack, which was thwarted by passengers after <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> had stabbed the driver. His eldest brother, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, says his only regret is that <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> did not succeed in plunging the bus off the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv-Jerusalem </LOCATION> highway. `` I think he did the right thing,'' said the 31-year-old blacksmith. `` If he had succeeded in what he planned to do and died a martyr, it would have been better.'' <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> said he hates the Israelis, who have occupied this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of 25,000 since the 1967 Middle East War. He valued his family's lost home at $ 120,000. The family says they will spend their days in the U.N.-donated tent, furnished with a battered sofa from their house. During the winter, they plan to sleep in neighbors' homes where some of their other furniture is stored. Mrs. <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> said she does n't have the money to rent a house or rebuild, but she added she accepted the loss. `` If we need a state, this is the price, even if we have to give all our houses for <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' she said. The army demolished two other homes of suspected Palestinian attackers Wednesday, both in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp. One home in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was sealed, raising the numbers of sealed houses to 117 since the start of the uprising against Israeli rule on Dec. 8, 1987.

He said the gunman dropped his captives off in a rural area, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> got away unharmed, believing she was getting help while the <ORGANIZATION> Haleys </ORGANIZATION> hid in woods. The bodies of the Haleys were found in a field about two miles from where the gunman had dropped them off, <PERSON> Flory </PERSON> said.

 The strain of a six-day coup attempt showed upon the face of <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as she appealed Wednesday for her people to stand behind her in the gravest crisis faced by her 3 -LCB- - year administration Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the appeal in her first nationally televised appearance since Sunday, when she told military mutineers to `` surrender or die.'' But on Wednesday, it was a different `` Cory'' Aquino. Gone was the steely, uncompromising firmness that marked not only the Sunday speech but other addresses she has delivered during five previous coup attempts. This time, her eyes were swollen and her face was drawn. She stared plaintively into the camera like a woman who had been betrayed. `` I did not think of being president,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` I just wanted to serve you. I just wanted to restore democracy. I want to respect your rights. I am only asking you to help me.'' In previous crises, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> delivered speeches in the crisp monotone of a teacher lecturing an errant pupil. She prefers to make speeches in English, an official language in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, however, she spoke in <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION>, a native language better understood by ordinary Filipinos. Her choice of words and the manner of speaking exuded more desperation than confidence. `` I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for democracy,'' she said, raising her arms slightly. `` I lost my husband. ... Many of us suffered and until now we have put our lives at stake.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was slain in 1983 as he stepped from a jet after arriving in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for leadership of the country. Ordinarily, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> reads speeches carefully crafted by her staff. This time, she appeared to. be speaking extemporaneuosly, and from the `` Why did I become president?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> asked. `` That was because you believed in me. And in spite of all of the coup attempts, you have stuck by me. And I know that I owe my being president to you.''

 The White House today defended its decision to name a Panamanian as acting administrator of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> against criticism that it disrupts the treaty rules for eventually transferring control of the waterway to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We think this was the correct course of action,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in replying to charges by members of the political opposition in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The treaties require that a Panamanian take charge as administrator of the canal on Jan. 1, 1990, for the first time in the 75-year history of the waterway. The treaties also stipulate that it is up to the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to nominate a canal administrator, then for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to appoint him, subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to recognize the government put in power by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and has spurned its choice for the post on a permanent basis. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to name an acting administrator reflects ` the political realities of the situation'' and allows `` uninterrupted compliance with the treaty'' and continued operation of the canal without introducing `` a new political figure in here that would result in political turmoil.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Tuesday he has asked the canal's deputy administrator, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON>, to take over as acting administrator. `` I have accepted because I consider it the only responsible option under the circumstances,'' <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> said in a written statement in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Opposition leaders warned that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action `` creates an irregular situation not foreseen in the treaties.'' `` We warn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that because of its irregularity this situation disrupts the orderly process of nationalization of the canal that we Panamanians claim as an irreversible process,'' said the statement from former opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his vice presidential running mates <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. The man recommended by the Panamanian government for the job, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano-Duque </PERSON>, director-president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper and a former lawmaker for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, published a letter in his newspaper last month saying <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> would be guilty of treason if he accepted the position. <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON>, commerce minister under the late Panamanian leader <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, said in his statement, `` I am confident that when emotions are cooled down all will agree that I did the right thing.'' There was no official government comment. The White House said a permanent appointment would be made `` at such time as a legitimate Panamanian government exists and proposes its candidate for administrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in the treaty and applicable law.'' `` As this step demonstrates, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is committed to meeting the requirements of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> even under current circumstances in which no legitimate government authority exists in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> would succeed <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, a former commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who has been administrator of the canal commission for a decade. The treaty also requires that an American be named deputy administrator in 1990. The White House said that decision will be made later by the board of directors of the canal commission. The transfer of power to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be completed at the end of the century, when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> assumes full control of the canal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced last week he is banning Panamanian-flag vessels from entering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports after Jan. 31. It is the latest step to bring economic pressure on the Central American nation to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug racketeering charges.

 A non-Communist took over as head of state today for the first time in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s history, and the state-run media said it had received reports that demonstrators were storming army installations. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, the leader of the non-Communist <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced on national television that he was named the new interim head of state and that he will serve until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elects a permanant president.

The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> announced it had indications that people were storming army installations, and it appealed for the pro-democracy movement to remain calm during the political crisis. `` In the last few hours, there have been growing indications of stormings of facilities and installations of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' the government said in a statement distributed by ADN It did not specify where the assaults were taking place, or say how many people were involved. The government called for `` calm and restraint.'' On Tuesday, angry citizens began surrounding and in some cases forcing their way into buildings housing the secret police in an effort to stop the destruction of documents needed in prosecutions of former Communist officials. The Liberal Democrats were long allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but have since said that they will no longer run in a Communist-led bloc. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> has been spearheading drives for reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and has been taking on an increasingly prominent role since the ouster of hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18. The political makeup of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which was founded in 1949, is being shaped by the pro-democracy movement on a day-by-day basis. The country is now run by a 25-member committee of Communists who took over when the Communist leadership resigned Sunday. A special party congress will decide on a new party leadership Friday. A non-Communist has never before held the post of president in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Under previous Communist governments, the post had been largely ceremonial, but it was unclear whether it would have a more important role in the current turmoil shaking the country. Reflecting the political crisis in the country, <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> said he was `` not happy'' about taking on the new duties. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which commands the armed forces, resigned. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who had led the council, came to power on Oct. 18, but he was unpopular because of his ties to the previous leadership. He has now lost all his posts. He resigned as Communist party chief on Sunday, along with the ruling Politburo and the entire policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION>. The embattled Communists, who had planned to hold the emergency congress on Dec. 15, will now hold it Friday and totally revamp the party structure. Reform began in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was forced out following 18 years in power. Since then, a popular uprising and exodus of thousands of people to the West have forced the Communist government to open <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to allow citizens to travel freely. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also has given up its guaranteed monopoly on power. The swift and wholly unexpected changes have left what many people in this country regard as a dangerous power vaccuum in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the emergency <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress on Friday will propose a `` radical'' reformation of the party into a `` modern socialist party committed to democratic socialism.'' There already has been widespread talk of renaming the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, while the leadership itself has warned it faces a possible breakup. `` The congress must make a final break with the Stalinist system'' and put the party on an even footing with other political forces, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the Communists want to elect a leadership that will be able to `` guarantee its full authority as a party with equal rights in the reform of society.'' No reason was given today for <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s resignation as president. The announcement came three days after he quit as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief because his ties to former party leaders made him unacceptable to the reform movement. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has been virtually without power since stepping down as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary on Sunday. His ties with past leaders had made him the target of growing criticism, within the party and among opposition groups. He was president since Oct. 24.

 Leftist guerrillas shot down a military observation plane, and scattered fighting killed five rebels and two government soldiers, the army said Wednesday. The O-2 observation plane was shot down by rebel rifle fire Tuesday near the town of <LOCATION> Ozatlan </LOCATION>, 88 miles southeast of the capital, killing the pilot, the army said. The rebel clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said the plane _ the second downed in the past month _ was shot down as it was firing rockets at rebel position. An A-37 jet fighter-bomber was similarly shot down by the rebels Nov. 18 in the eastern province of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> broadcast said the rebels have damaged 23 government aircraft during a new offensive they launched Nov. 11, but the claim could not be independently verified and military sources refused to confirm or deny it. Government planes recently have been forced to fly low and suffer greater exposure to automatic weapons fire after the rebels were supplied with Soviet-made SAM-7s and other surface-to-air missiles. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of supplying the Salvadoran guerrillas with the rockets after several of them were found in two small aircraft that crashed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Nov. 25. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government neither confirmed nor denied the accusation and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> suspended diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Except for one bus that police said was set afire, the capital remained free of violence Wednesday for the first time since the offensive began. The army said fighting occurred overnight and early Wednesday around <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of the capital, where three rebels were killed, and on the slopes of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION> mountain, six miles to the southwest, where two guerrillas and two soldiers were killed.

 There's always a warm and boisterous crowd upstairs at the Crossroads bar, but walk in on Thursday night's gang and you'll be stunned by the lively silence Clinking beer mugs, darts hitting a board and an occasional fist on the table are the only sounds. The banter is carried on with fluttering hands and a tap on the wrist by the dozens of deaf and hearing impaired who make this <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> neighborhood bar their own once a week. `` Deaf is a small world,'' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said through a signing interpreter. `` Where else do you go to meet deaf people and socialize?'' The Thursday night gang at Crossroads has grown from a few friends a few years ago to capacity crowds of 150 to 300 people from all over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> who gather each Thursday in the comfortable, collegiate atmosphere for conversation and camaraderie. Visitors to the city also stop by, including students from <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, the nation's only university for the hearing impaired. The regulars say it's their only alternative to deaf clubs, which cater to older crowds with bingo games and bridge. One cold Thursday night in November, patrons gathered with an interpreter around the end of the bar and told how important the gathering is to the young deaf community. It's a time when everyone in the bar speaks their language. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON>, one of the group's founder, now works behind the bar on Thursday, giving signers an advantage any thirsty soul who ever called to a barkeep can appreciate. `` I can take an order across the room and by the time you get to the bar I can have it ready,'' <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennison </PERSON>, a 21-year-old from <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, tells her hearing friends she's going to a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bar, they think of getting all dolled up to dance and flirt. `` That's not the point here,'' she said. `` It's to meet old friends and deaf people. I just dress anyway I feel.'' The group comes from all walks of life. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> works with the mentally retarded; <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Newbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> who is interested in fashion design; <PERSON> Jolley </PERSON> works for the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokotoff </PERSON> teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dennison </PERSON> is an actress. Hearing people are welcome, and if someone knows how to sign they can ususally join any of the highly visible conversations. `` It's special here because the deaf and the hearing and the hearing impaired all have a chance to mix,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. The jukebox occasionally kicks on when a hearing person drops in a quarter; around the room the conversation goes on uninterrupted. Some hearing people who unwittingly stumble upon the group, however, find it `` hard to understand deaf culture,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, who is deaf. Some take offense, for example, when the deaf pound a table or stamp on the floor, sending out vibrations to get the attention of another deaf person. `` Hearing can call you and get your attention. Hearing thinks the pounding is a stupid thing to do,'' <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. `` It's my way. I have to do it that way to get people's attention.'' Many hearing people learning to sign at nearby universities stop by to find patient conversation partners, and maybe even learn a few deaf jokes. `` You learn better here talking to deaf people because its more natural,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, who learned to sign to communicate with his deaf brother. `` After they see you're someone learning to sign, these guys will turn around, shake your hand and invite you in.'' Sign language's special syntax gives the deaf their own brand of humor and a repertoire of jokes not easily related to the hearing world. But the deaf have an advantage in a pastime as old as barrooms _ eavesdropping. `` Sure,'' <PERSON> Mokotoff </PERSON> said, jumping up on a chair and looking across the room. `` Want to know what they're saying at that table over there?''

 A truck bomb exploded during rush hour today in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, and officials said at least 31 people were killed and 950 injured near a building housing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s federal police force Several stores were destroyed, and police appealed for anyone in the area with picks and shovels to help search through rubble for survivors. Cries for help could be heard beneath some of the ruins, according to radio reports. The explosion, which heavily damaged the police building, left a crater 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide and damaged or destroyed 60 cars. The roof of a car 10 feet from the crater was flattened, and a body was hanging from the window. The owner of a hardware store cried out in agony when he saw the bodies of his wife and daughter brought out of the rubble. Only his little girl's patent leather shoes were visible beneath the bloody sheet covering her. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on drug traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nation's cities in an effort to stop the government from extraditing suspected traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The explosion occurred less than 24 hours after the government said a bomb placed aboard a Colombian airliner had caused it to crash shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> last month, killing all 107 people aboard. Authorities believe the drug traffickers also may have been responsibile for that bomb. Also today, a reputed Colombian drug dealer who is a nephew of one of the nation's drug kingpins was reportedly arrested in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The truck, which was rigged with dynamite, exploded in front of the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s federal investigations police. The bomb heavily damaged the headquarters, which contain the offices of many federal judges. All the windows in the front of the building were blown out and broken blocks of concrete hung from many of the offices. The blast occurred at 7:30 a.m., after the headquarters had opened for the day. Casualty reports changed almost by the minute, but bodies of dead and injured people were spread over a five-square-block area. Health Minister <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said in an interview with the radio network Caracol that at least 31 people were killed. He said about 250 people were injured seriously and 700 treated for minor injuries. The Colombian radio network <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>, quoting police sources and checking with hospitals and clinics in the area, said 40 persons had been killed. The police department, known as the DAS, is where many foreigners usually line up at this time of year to get authorization to leave the country for Christmas vacations. It was not known immediately if any foreigners were hurt in the explosion. The foreigners must get clearance from the DAS, which checks to see whether they face any criminal charges in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The building is near a plaza that is normally filled with fruit and candy vendors in the morning and scores of people walking to work. The goverment of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on the nation's cocaine cartels after Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader, was assassinated on Aug. 18. As part of the crackdown, the government has been extraditing drug suspects wanted on charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug traffickers have responded with a nationwide bombing campaign. More than 200 attacks have killed 29 people and wounded 238. Hours after the report on the plane bombing Tuesday, a judge investigating drug traffickers was assassinated, the fourth judge killed in 15 weeks. Judge <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> was shot to death while strolling through <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the base of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country's largest cocaine cartel. Authorities investigating the plane crash said that a bomb had been placed inside the passenger area of Avianca Flight 203 that exploded Nov. 27. Colombians reacted with shock and fear to the report about the plane bombing, which caused the highest death toll from a single attack in the wave of terrorism. In <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, police said today that <PERSON> Severo </PERSON> `` Junior'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, reputedly one of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leading drug barons, had been arrested in southern <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed reports in the French-language Tribune de Geneve that the 30-year-old nephew of Colombian kingpin, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, 39, was arrested Nov. 29. The elder <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is considered one of the top 12 Colombian drug dealers sought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FAA Says ``No'' to Private Albany Airport</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A proposal to sell the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to private bidders has been set back by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, but proponents insist the deal is not dead. The negotiations to sell or lease the airport were viewed as the possible beginning of a trend toward privatization of the nation's municipal airports <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, the Democratic county executive who initiated the proposal to sell the airport, said today that he felt misled by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations after being told of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s disapproval `` Here's an administration that has been very much a proponent, at least verbally, concerning privatization,'' <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON> said. `` I feel we were misled by that administration.'' <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>'s airport and others run by cities and local governments are increasingly beset with crowding and flight delays because terminal expansion has failed to keep up with the growth in airline travel. The last big airport to open was <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>'s 15 years ago. Backers of private ownership say the profit motive would force corporate operators to do a better job running airports than governments do. Opponents contend private owners would raise the fees they charge airlines, thus driving up ticket prices. The proposal is not dead. <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON> said he will work with executives of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Latham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as well as the local bus authority, to explore ways to privatize the airport without running into trouble with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I still feel the private sector is the best way to go,'' said <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials ruled earlier this week that airport revenue had to be put back into the airport, rather than used for profits or to repay debt raised to buy the airport. British American executives said the ruling was a setback, but not a death blow to their bid. `` I think it has tremendous impact not only on the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but to every airport around the country,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON>, president of British American. `` If that stands up it is sending a signal all around the country that we are not working toward privatization, but toward nationalization of airports,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Local governments will just step away from running these airports and the federal government will have to step in. I do n't think that was the intent.'' One solution, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> said, would be to break the airport up into segments, using revenues from operations not regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, such as parking and car rentals, for profit and debt service, while operating the airline segments separately under <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. British American and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> had combined to offer to buy the airport for $ 30 million and run it for a profit. County officials hoped to use the money to avoid raising taxes while financing county operations.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the opposition, the 18-day popular revolt that has brought their compatriots a heady dose of freedom has been a harrowing round of endless meetings to make sure the uprising stays on course. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the opposition's best-known leader, looked exhausted Wednesday when he announced that a new government would be formed with opposition approval later this week. Bustling around the opposition's new headquarters in a central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> gallery, grabbing sandwiches and coffee, the activists are growing more weary with each day that brings them a real say in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s politics. Dissidents who once spent hours talking to reporters in their apartments bustled in and out of a tactical session, pausing only to smile and refusing to answer questions. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Milota </PERSON>, a film director banned from his profession for years, organized the opposition's own cameras to transmit <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s news conference `` It will be good when this war is over,'' he sighed, the rings under his eyes dark from lack of sleep. `` We are tired people here,'' said a weary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>, almost frantic in his appeal for calm. `` We have been sleeping only one and a half hours. So, be patient, please.'' In the 18 astounding days that have propelled the Charter 77 dissidents who make up the core of Civic Forum from isolation to daily negotiations with the Communists, tactics have changed almost hourly. At its founding meeting Nov. 19, Civic Forum simply demanded the ouster of five hard-line Communists associated with the crackdown after 1968, two men linked to Nov. 17 police brutality, and an investigation into that crackdown, threatening a general strike if those demands were not met. When more than 100,000 people turned out in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to support them the next day, the opposition found itself suddenly wielding surprising force. On Nov. 21, there was a first meeting with Communist premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>. At two marathon sessions Nov. 24 and Nov. 26, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ousted the leaders who had pursued hard-line policies for 21 years. On Nov. 28, the day after the hugely successful general strike, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> relinquished the Communists' 41-year hold on power, voted out of the constitution the next day in parliament. All the time, the opposition was changing tactics, formulating new demands intended to ensure that, this time, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> gets real democracy, and not the Communist-led reforms crushed by a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion in 1968. Within days of Civic Forum's formation, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other dissidents who spent years in jail and isolation from society had assembled a team of economists, lawyers and other advisers, many of them experts who spent years in the wilderness after the crackdown on the 1968 `` Prague Spring.'' Changing roles swiftly from dissident playwright to political negotiator, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has closeted himself with these advisers to hammer out tactics. As the protest spread to workers, more representatives from the factories were admitted to these sessions and addressed opposition rallies. The composition of delegations visiting <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> and other officials also has changed to reflect new strands in the movement, bringing in Slovak representatives, students, young people and artists. `` It's really funny,'' said an opposition activist who did not want to be identified. `` Everybody wants to meet with us now, to prove how democratic they are and how they always favored reform.'' The higher the stakes, the more the opposition has taken on the attributes of any political organization dealing with a public avid for news. Leaks are constantly sought, and rarely given; leading figures who spoke publicly on any point days ago have clammed up. `` Please understand that we can not answer any of the questions you want to ask us,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> after <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> announced a new government would be formed this week. `` These are crazy times, really crazy.'' Another problem some activists face is that they still have jobs amid their opposition activity. <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> and fellow dissident <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>, for instance, swap shifts as stokers at the same factory; their fellow workers ca n't make up for them all the time `` Last week, I had the wives of co-workers sending me notes as we held our meetings, offering to work extra,'' <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said with a chuckle. The success of what is half-jokingly known as the `` velvet revolution'' _ for its smoothness _ depends on the ability of the opposition to keep the ball rolling. On Tuesday, constitutional lawyers who had a blueprint for a new, democratic constitution ready for months presented it on behalf of Civic Forum to parliament. By Wednesday, the opposition had new demands to remove the federal and Czech regional public prosecutors. Keeping the pressure up in this way involves the help of legions of young people working as guards and secretaries, and running errands. They bustle around the new opposition headquarters, hurriedly relocated Tuesday to a downtown club from the nearby <LOCATION> Laterna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Magika </LOCATION> theater. There is almost no time to keep up with events absorbing everyday life. Economist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, a leading adviser to Civic Forum, pounced on a pile of newspapers lying around the offices Wednesday. `` I have n't seen the newspapers for days,'' he said smiling as he plunged into another closed-door meeting.

<HEAD>Productivity Up Revised 2.5 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economic Outlook, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American workers made modest productivity gains in the third quarter but the lackluster manufacturing sector posted its lowest output gain in three years and continued to slow the overall economy, the government said Wednesday. And for the first time this year, the quarter-to-quarter hourly wage gains made by workers outpaced the the growth in consumer inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy increased at a revised annual rate of 2.5 percent in the July-September period, more than double the anemic 1.1 percent annual-rate gain in the second quarter. But in manufacturing, a sector weakened by slumping auto sales and other problems, productivity increased at a revised annual rate of just 1 percent after improving at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the April-June period. The poor manufacturing performance came as output rose just 1.2 percent and hours worked increased a weak 0.2 percent, reflecting slackened demand for goods. The increase in output was the smallest since a slight decline in the second quarter of 1986. Because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and a significant increase in wages, unit labor costs, a key determinant of future price inflation, rose at at an annual rate of 4.9 percent after decreasing by 1 percent in the second quarter. It was the largest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982 recession, the department said. That increase will likely translate into either higher prices for consumers for manufactured goods or lower profits for producers _ or both _ and also makes it more difficult for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers to compete in overseas markets. `` We're getting more upward wage pressure in manufacturing and with the weak productivity numbers, that pushes up costs,'' the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephansen </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION>, echoed the sentiments of most analysts in saying it was unlikely the manufacturing sector would rebound until interest rates drop further, which she said could come soon if November employment data due Friday showed continued economic weakness. The overall 2.5 percent annual-rate productivity gain in the non-farm sector came as output rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in the July-September period while hours worked grew at a much slower annual rate of 1.3 percent. For the overall non-farm sector, the data on unit labor costs was more encouraging. Costs per good produced rose at a revised annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter after rising at a rapid 4.5 percent rate in the April-June period. The government said hourly compensation in the non-farm sector grew at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the July-September period, an increase that translated into a real earnings gain of 2.8 percent an hour when inflation is taken into account. The hourly compensation for manufacturing workers increased at an annual rate of 5.9 percent. After inflation is factored into that improvement, manufacturing workers received a real hourly earnings boost of 3.5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. For both the overall economy and the manufacturing sector it was the first time this year that workers enjoyed an increase in real hourly earnings _ wage gains minus the erosion of buying power caused by inflation.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> overruled staff prosecutors in ordering a preliminary inquiry into allegations of political favoritism and perjury by former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> reversed the recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section that there was an insufficient basis to conduct a preliminary inquiry of the allegations against <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. The 60-day inquiry <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered will determine whether he should seek court appointment of an independent counsel to conduct a full criminal investigation of the former housing secretary. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> dismissed suggestions that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had ordered the preliminary inquiry to deflect charges from Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was scuttling an investigation of a fellow Republican and former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleague in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` He was concerned that the issues reviewed needed further investigation,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` He was n't convinced by the public integrity section's point of view.'' The allegations that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> awarded <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> grants on the basis of political favoritism and lied under oath during congressional hearings last spring were made last month by 19 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. The lawmakers cited testimony that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> gave to the House Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee that he had not had `` hands on'' involvement in the award of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants to politically connected developers. The independent counsel process was triggered when the 19 Democrats, members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, forwarded their allegations to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Nov. 2. In accordance with that procedure, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disclosed Monday his decision to conduct the preliminary inquiry. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing but has twice refused to give additional testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers have contended that the lawmakers did not provide the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with any `` specific and credible'' evidence that their client had committed a crime. The public integrity section, applying that standard as outlined in the independent counsel law, apparently agreed with that view. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers expressed confidence that the preliminary inquiry would not result in the appointment of an independent counsel.

<TEXT>
 Under irresistible pressure from the rank-and-file to cleanse itself, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is moving at top speed against the previously iron-clad taboos of the Stalin era. The latest indication came Wednesday when the official party newspaper urged a full investigation into the deaths of thousands of German Communists killed in <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges in the 1930s and 1940s. On Tuesday night, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> saw its first-ever concert and the opening of an exhibition commemorating victims of the Soviet dictator's repression. An emergency party congress Friday is expected to recast the Communists' internal structure with the aim of building a democratically run party. Such a move would respond to calls in several East German newspapers Wednesday for abolition of `` Stalinist structures'' in the party, including such instruments of uncompromising rule from the top as the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Politburo. `` Why do we need a Politburo if we want to turn the SED -LRB- East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- into a democratic party?'' asked the official party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>. New party structures must prevent `` corruption, abuse of official position or arrogance of power,'' Berliner Zeitung newspaper said. Before the special classical concert in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s opera, author <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON> told the audience, `` Today a swamp of incredible dimensions is emerging. It will stop instilling fear when it is reclaimed.'' Introducing <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth Symphony, one speaker read a list of victims of Stalinist repression in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and paid tribute to those killed during purges in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON>, commenting on the death of thousands of German Communists in Siberian labor camps between the world wars, said: `` We have been silent too long about the fate of most of them,'' and it asked how the official blind eye toward `` this sorry chapter'' could be justified. East German party officials have already demanded access to Soviet files allegedly listing the victims. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vosske </PERSON>, head of the party's central archives, suggested that a plaque commemorating Communists killed in <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s time be put up in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Several leading intellectuals have been officially rehabilitated, including the philosopher <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and physicist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Havemann </PERSON>, a long-time dissident. The party was also considering the rehabilitation of two journalists sacked for dissent in 1953, including a former chief editor of <LOCATION> Neues </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deutschland </LOCATION>. New Culture Minister <PERSON> Dietmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, a Communist, recently said the country is open for a range of opinions and the party will no longer censor artists. At his first news conference, he appealed to exiled East German cultural figures to resume ties with their native country despite `` the long shadows of history.'' Officials have already announced that films banned in the 1960s for questioning Stalinist policies will be be shown, some of them for the first time.

<HEAD>Iran Says 900 Drug Smugglers Face Gallows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Wednesday that 900 suspected drug smugglers face the gallows in a year-old narcotics crackdown in which more than 1,000 men and women already have been executed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted a senior official as saying that 14,000 people, including 569 Afghans, had been arrested since March for major drug offenses. `` Nine hundred of these are liable for the death penalty,'' said <PERSON> Kiyumars </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON>, director-general of the Islamic Revolutionary Committees' anti-narcotics division. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s anti-drug campaign could eventually dam up what has become a major narcotics pipeline into Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Human rights organizations have condemned the large number of executions in the ruthless crackdown, begun a year ago. But a campaign that cuts the volume of heroin flooding into the West could help President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s efforts to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation and restore relations with the West. It also would coincide with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war on drugs and possibly help foster a dialogue betwen <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which severed relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1979. An anti-narcotics law passed Jan. 21 stipulates the death penalty for anyone found with even small amounts of heroin or opium, the base for heroin. Iranian authorities have hanged in a single day as many as 80 people convicted of smuggling by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s non-jury Islamic courts. The bodies are often left dangling from makeshift gallows or overhead road bridges for the day as a warning. The news agency quoted <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> as saying authorities had broken up more than 140 smuggling gangs since March and seized more than 21 tons of narcotics. Scores of the heavily armed smugglers have been killed in battles with security forces, it said. More than 41,000 addicts have been arrested and sent to labor camps for rehabilitation, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> said, adding that 10,000 had remained off drugs. Officials have estimated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 1 million addicts. But the total is believed to be double that because addiction has soared since the 1979 Islamic revolution and during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. The Iranians are trying to coordinate their crackdown with neighoring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where much of the heroin, opium and hashish originates, and with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Interior Minister <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON> signed an accord with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> last month to work together on anti-narcotics operations along the border. Earlier this year, Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> declared war on the country's 40 drug mafias. But drug barons in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are deeply entrenched, and Western drug enforcement officials say the lucrative smuggling operations involve military and government officials. Stopping smuggling from neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to the northeast is even more of a problem because of the civil war in that nation. Moslem guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government reportedly help bankroll their campaign by smuggling opium. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have largely replaced southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as the key producer of heroin following a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crackdown in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the past decade. A recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on narcotics said that `` opium production and heroin trafficking are deeply entrenched'' in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It said that between 200 and 400 tons of opium were produced in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1987, 800 tons in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and more than 200 tons in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The opium often is refined into heroin in secret laboratories in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and smuggled into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> by truck. Other shipments are carried by mule trains through the mountains of <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>, which occupies southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Kurdish guerrillas are said to help and use their profits to buy weapons for their separatist campaigns against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON> has assigned tens of thousands of security forces backed by helicopter gunships to hunt down the drug smugglers. The smugglers are armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and anti-aircraft weapons and there have been scores of pitched battles along the rugged eastern borders over the last year.

 While the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> weighs its first `` right-to-die'' decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is drafting guidelines for dealing with those issues in its 276 medical centers and nursing homes. The VA currently follows the state laws such as the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law at the center of the case being reviewed by the high court. But the department has determined that a state-by-state approach is unworkable when both patients and doctors may transfer from facility to facility nationwide. The issue has become especially critical to the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> because it operates the nation's largest medical system and because of the age of its clientele. Nearly half the 27 million veterans in this country are older than 54. Unlike 32-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, who other than her brain injury was a healthy individual, <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> patients often are old, terminally or critically ill. VA actually began addressing such issues before 1983, when it implemented a `` do-not-resuscitate'' policy on certain terminally ill patients Dr. <PERSON> Dorthy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasinski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> physician and attorney in charge of the ethics committee drafting the latest proposed guidelines, says there is no conflict between the federal government arguing to uphold the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law while the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> is adopting nationwide regulations. But `` there do appear to be some superficial inconsistencies,'' she acknowledged in an interview from her office at the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> medical center, where she is assistant chief of staff for education. On determining what a comatose patient would have wanted, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> is leaning toward putting the next of kin next in line, along with the physicians, in making the decisions whether to withdraw life-sustaining equipment, she said. In the <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> case, Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>'s parents argued she had told them that she would not want artificial means if ever rendered incompetent. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said such statements fall well short of the `` clear and convincing'' evidence needed to prove her real intent. <PERSON> Rasinski </PERSON> said that the VA guidelines would not be so strict as to require a `` clear and convincing'' proof _ which she interprets as largely relying on written evidence. `` We would want something more than the unilateral recollection of a single conversation,'' she said. Nurses, physicians, families and friends would provide such evidence, she said. The VA realizes there are situations where the family member is not in the best position to make the decision, she said, and there are times when the physician has rejected a family member's recommendation that life-support be withdrawn She noted that in many cases a patient's wishes may be better understood by someone else, such as in the case of AIDS patients who have been alienated from their families because of homosexuality. Also, she said, family members may be motivated by the desire to collect survivors' benefits. But <PERSON> Rasinski </PERSON> says the centerpiece of the <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> policy will be the execution of a living-will document known as a `` durable power of attorney,'' in which patients specify their representatives and their wishes beforehand. At the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hospital, incoming patients are informed of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state law that provides for such living wills. The American Legion, a major veterans service organization, has not addressed the issue.

 A Roman Catholic assemblywoman's opponent today conceded she narrowly won a special <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election that attracted national attention after she was denied Communion because of her abortion-rights ads. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, voters rejected all eight proposals on their ballot. With all 536 of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> precincts reporting, four-term Democratic assemblywoman <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> led her Republican opponent, freshman Assemblywoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, by 1,528 votes. Although 2,500 to 3,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted this afternoon, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said at a news conference that she did not think they would make a difference. Without those ballots, the totals were 60,012, or 51 percent, for <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>'s 58,484 votes, or 49 percent. <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> declined to say if Bishop <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>'s Communion ban played a key role in the race. `` There's no way of really judging that,'' she said. `` I do n't know how you would figure it out other than get somebody to do some polling and I'm not going to do that. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said the Communion ban and abortion issue were decisive in the heavily Republican district. `` What this says is that my opponent's whole strategy was to focus this race on abortion, so people would n't be looking at her liberal voting record in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` The bishop had an incredible impact on this race. In one letter, he created an instant international celebrity and a martyr.'' <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>'s win `` a stunning victory.'' `` The bishop shot himself in the foot,'' said <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, who was rasied as a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is not the role for religion. They should not be getting involved in politics. ... The voters there really rose up against what the bishop was trying to do.'' In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a four-year legal battle to boost Hispanic representation on <ORGANIZATION> Watsonsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ended with Hispanics losing three of four seats they had sought. The election was the first under a district-vote system. Council candidates previously were elected at large. In deciding the most questions on a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> ballot since 1919, voters soundly defeated proposals to raise the gasoline tax, income tax and sales tax. With all precincts reporting, the closest margin was on the proposal to raise the 5 percent sales tax by 1 percent. It lost 53 percent to 47 percent. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> pondered budget cuts and a special legislative session today after the proposed tax increases were defeated. `` I've done my best to explain what we thought was at stake,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, who had campaigned for the tax increases. `` Now I have to do the best I can to make it work.'' Tax opponents, led by <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> businessman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, celebrated. `` It's people power. The people of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> have spoken tonight,'' he said. More than 60 percent of voters also defeated a mandatory seat belt law; a measure to legalize video gambling machines; and a proposed health and sex education curriculum in public schools. The seventh measure, a proposal to allow <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> legislators to join the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, lost by 88 percent, the unofficial totals showed. And a constitutional amendment calling for reorganization of the executive branch of state government lost by 71-29 percent. More than 230,000 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> _ 48 percent of eligible voters _ thronged to the polls. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Valeu </PERSON>, deputy secretary of state, said the turnout topped the record of 212,000 in a special ballot in July 1939 that rejected a tax increase and liquor sales in stores. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public official to be denied Communion by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> because of her support for abortion rights. <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> has said she will not change her stance on abortion. The special election was held to replace the incumbent, who was made a municipal judge. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>'s election was originally scheduled for Nov. 7, but was postponed after the Oct. 17 earthquake, which demolished more than 300 homes in the farming community 95 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Housing and development, which were big issues before the quake, took on even greater importance afterward.

<TEXT>
 Novelist <PERSON> Regine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> plagiarized the classic `` Gone with the Wind'' for her best-seller `` The Blue Bicycle,'' a court ruled Wednesday, ordering her and her publisher to pay <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s heirs $ 333,000 in damages and interest. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Bank, which holds the world rights to `` Gone with the Wind,'' had sought $ 833,000 from Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> and her publisher, Editions <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> President <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> said the company and Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> would appeal. The novelist was in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and unavailable for comment, he said. `` We feel we're innocent,'' <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The books are both great novels but they are very different, and so are their heroines. By nature, <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> is an optimist, and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> is more Anglo-Saxon, hard-driving, determined and power-hungry. `` Let's put it this way: ` The Blue Bicycle' is a historical novel smattered with psychology and emotion while ` Gone With the Wind' is a pyschological novel cloaked with history,'' he said. In a judgment issued by Judge <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>, the court concluded `` The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an `` illicit reproduction'' of `` Gone with the Wind.'' `` Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear that what <PERSON> Regine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> borrowed from <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s work and incorporated into ` The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable and relates to the most important elements of Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s novel,'' the statement said The court said Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> copied the `` general intrigue, plot development and narrative progression, the physical and psychological characteristics of the major figures, the relationships between the characters, several secondary characters, a large number of characteristic situations, the composition and expression of numerous scenes and key dramatic moments'' of `` Gone with the Wind.'' There are similarities. `` The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold millions of copies since it was published in 1983 as the first part of a trilogy, is set during the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Its heroine, <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Delmas </PERSON>, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter of a southern vintner. Like <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, her carefree youth is interrupted by the horrors of war. The opening scenes of garden parties, pretty dresses and breathless suitors are reminiscent of the American South. And <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the Civil War, is divided.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> today blamed the crew of a <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> freight train for failing to secure the brakes before a crash and chemical explosion that forced evacuation of 2,000 people in subfreezing <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> last winter. The board also cited as contributing to the accident the decision of an engineer to rearrange the train's locomotives while leaving the cars unattended on a mountain grade; the effects of the cold that reached a wind-chill factor of minus-70 degrees at the time of the Feb. 2 crash; and inadequate training by the railroad management. The board, voting 4-0, issued several recommendations to the railroad, to <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> which owned the tracks, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railraod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION> and the city of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. The independent safety board determines probable cause of accidents and makes recommendations for improving safety but has no statutory or police authority. Cars from the train, which had been making its way up a long mountain grade en route to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, coasted backwards nine miles into <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> and hit another train and a propane tank. Flames from the propane explosion ignited one of the derailed cars, which contained highly flammable chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> noted that the release of hazardous materials contributed to the severity of the 4:48 a.m. crash, in which no one was killed or seriously injured. Damage was estimated at $ 6 million, not including several private homes that suffered broken windows and other damage. Board investigators said the crew of the train failed to properly secure train brakes after disconnecting cars so they could rearrange engines that were helping the train up the long grade toward the Continental Divide. The decision to move the engines was made after the heater and then the engine failed in the lead locomotive.

<HEAD>Egypt Gives Nod To Baker Proposal on Peace Talks</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has agreed to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposals for a direct dialogue between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives provided certain conditions are met, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> called the Egyptian reply a `` step forward'' for the peace process. She raised the possibility of a meeting among the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state early next year to work on additional steps. However, it appeared there were still roadblocks to the start of any direct talks among all the parties. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has been working as the intermediary between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in the effort to get a dialogue under way. Its response follows weeks of contacts between Egyptian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> indicated that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had done earlier, set forth certain conditions that must be met if it is to continue participating in the peace process. One such condition, based on statements over the weekend by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representatives, is that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participate in selecting the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for the dialogue with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Earlier, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had accepted the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan on the condition that no <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative take part. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also is demanding that the talks be limited to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yithak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections in the occupied territories. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> favors a dialogue only if it deals with broader issues. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an adviser to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was waiting to see the Egyptian response in writing. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> this morning to brief him on the response. `` We have now received from the government of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> a positive response to Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five-point framework,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to a trilateral meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as part of a process for launching an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue,'' she said. The key element in a five-point <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s view that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives will take part in the dialogue on the basis of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election proposal. Under that proposal, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> would elect representatives to open negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan also makes a concession to the Palestinian side in stating that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives at the talks would be free to `` raise issues that relate to their opinions on how to make the elections and the negotiating process succeed.'' This raises the possibility, although not explicitly, of a more open agenda in the talks than that favored by the Israelis, who want to avoid discussion of points which are of high priority to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, such as the establishment of a Palestinian state.

<HEAD>U.S. Explorer Says Ancient Tablets May Link Solomon to Peruvian Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An American explorer said Wednesday he has found ancient stone tablets in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s highland jungle that may prove the area was the site of King <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s legendary gold mines. `` We have found something that is going to revolutionize the archaeological interpretation of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s ancient civilizations,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON>, an explorer and historian. <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON>, 62, is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Explorers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and is credited with discovering 40 lost cities in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s remote tropical rain forests in three decades of work. He said in an interview the tablets contain the first writing found from the ancient civilizations of the Andes and that the inscriptions are similar to Phoenician and Semitic hieroglyphs. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s pre-Colombian cultures, which culminated with the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>, were not known to have written languages. <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> said he found three tablets, each weighing several tons and measuring about 5 by 10 feet, in August in a cave near <LOCATION> Gran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vilaya </LOCATION>, the immense ruins of the Chachapoyas Indian civilization that he discovered in 1985. The Gran Vilaya ruins are 400 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and 9,000 feet above sea level in a fog-shrouded region of the Andes that Peruvians call the `` jungle's eyebrow.'' <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> displayed photos of the tablets, which he said remain in the cave, and sketches of rubbings taken from the stones. He pointed out the similarities between the stylized inscriptions and samples of Phoenician hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphs on the tablets are similar to those used in King <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s time and include one identical to the symbol that always appeared on the ships he sent to the legendary land of <PERSON> Ophir </PERSON>, which the Bible described as the source of his gold, <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> said. `` When I first heard about the possible contact between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, nobody was more skeptical than I was,'' he said. `` I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. They've been talking about this crazy stuff for years `` But now we've got stone tablets and this can not be denied.'' <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON>, who has written books on his explorations in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, said he has studied his findings since early September and is preparing to publish them. `` The tablets were not brought here from another country like <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. This is a Chachapoyas form of hieroglyphic writing,'' he said, referring to the Indian empire that once dominated the jungle region. `` We're talking about something very old. It's possible the Andean cultures ... are much older than we realize, perhaps older than what we know as the Old World,'' <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> said he has found ancient stone roads leading down from the misty heights of <LOCATION> Gran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vilaya </LOCATION> to the river tributaries that feed into the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. He said the Chachapoyas `` could have used the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> as a highway to the sea. And there is no reason the Egyptians or Hebrews could n't have used the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> in reverse.'' `` This is controversial, of course,'' he said. `` But it's all there for the doubters to see.'' <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> was decorated by the Peruvian <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week for his contributions to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. He lived from 1957 to 1970 in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and now resides in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, where he directs the <ORGANIZATION> Andean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Explorers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. In 1964, in what has been regarded as his most important discovery, he located <PERSON> Vilcabamba </PERSON>, the last Inca city. He discovered <PERSON> Gran </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilaya </PERSON> in 1985, which he says was the capital of the Chachapoyas culture. The civilization reached its zenith between 800 and 1000 A.D. and later was conquered by the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has a `` strange'' attitude toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and appeared to be standing still in a fast-moving world, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, reacting to a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> interview in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, said the vice president resisted adapting to the changes taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` You're still dealing with a totalitarian government'' that wants to `` create instability'' in other nations. `` I do n't think they've changed much in foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was quoted as saying.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had improved relations to `` a qualitatively new level.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` considers it to be a mistake to treat the meeting as a sign of change in Soviet foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said that despite the rapid changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` remains devoted to his own beliefs.'' `` A politician, if he is a realistically minded one, has to assess changes in the world, to react to the new challenges of the time,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` The remarks by the vice president, compared to other speeches _ by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> president, the American secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, the president's assistant on national security and others _ sounded strange,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. He compared <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to <PERSON> Kozma </PERSON> <PERSON> Prutkov </PERSON>, a character in Russian literature who was stubbornly resistant to change. `` Like <PERSON> Kozma </PERSON> <PERSON> Prutkov </PERSON>, this noble knight is in the same position, sitting on a stone while the world is changing.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday announced the formation of a task force designed to find ways to overcome what he called `` a crisis in Hispanic education.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> the panel should try to come up with recommendations to reduce a historically high Hispanic school dropout rate, promote adult literacy and send more Hispanics to college.

Among Hispanics over age 25, `` an alarming'' 52 percent have not completed high school, compared to 21 percent of non-Hispancis, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said Wednesday that `` television reporting on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes second place to reporting on the president'' and few newspapers provide detailed reporting of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceedings. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> spoke at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon during a symposium on `` The Press and a Divided Government,'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Gerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Former President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> also discussed the subject of press coverage of a government in which Republicans control the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> and Democrats dominate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it's hard,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` All you have to do is be fair.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said, `` To oversimplify the issue for the sake of debate, let's say television, with its emphasis on the personal, has become the major presidential news medium, and print, with its ability to describe complex issues, has become the major congressional medium. `` For TV evening news, with its mass audience, television reporting on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes second place to reporting on the president,'' he said. `` The only time network television gives the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a detailed look is when scandal erupts or if some committee is holding hearings on some currently hot topic,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` The rest of the time we could just as well be on the moon, so far as the mass audience is concerned.'' The Illinois Republican told his audience, `` Print journalism offers a bit more opportunity to go into detail. But how many American newspapers give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in-depth coverage? Not many.'' `` Aggressive press coverage of strongly held, clashing values in a divided government would be good for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` But we do n't have that kind of coverage. The press in general does a good job reporting on the foibles and the gaffes and the slips of a president. But it does n't provide a mass audience with the underlying realities of Democratic control of the House.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said that recently he and Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., held a news conference on the issue of House reform and added, `` After we spoke, the first question _ and most of the rest _ concerned a then-prominent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> scandal Only one major newspaper reported our proposals for reform.'' `` I'm not saying scandals should n't be covered,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` All I'm saying is that the dull, workaday routine of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that affects 200 million Americans, deserves equal time. `` So today I offer the networks and the majority of our nation's newspapers a challenge: prove that I'm wrong.

 The leading spokesman for Palestinians was barred Wednesday from entering the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the Arab uprising might last another two years. Troops opened fire in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> to disperse demonstrators, wounding eight Palestinians, hospital officials said. Six Arabs were shot by troops in stone-throwing clashes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, they said. The army imposed a curfew that will confine <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s 750,000 residents to their homes beginning Thursday to head off possible protests Friday, when the uprising enters its third year. A similar curfew was expected for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Soldiers also demolished three houses of Palestinians suspected in attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians. Palestinian spokesman <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, who lives in the Arab sector of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> annexed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was banned by the army from entering the occupied territories for six months. He accused authorities of trying to increase tension among Palestinians in the occupied territories. The army orders said the travel ban against <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, 49, was taken `` for the sake of ensuring public peace, the defense of the area and the establishment of public order.'' A military official said <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> was involved in `` incitement against the authorities, against the army.'' The official, who insisted on anonymity, gave no details. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a pro-PLO activist, was released from prison in January after being held for 18 months without charge or trial. But he has since been invited to several meetings by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials seeking his views on peace prospects. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said in an interview that the army action `` was not warranted.'' He noted that his trips to the occupied territories have largely dealt with settling disputes among various Palestinian factions. `` Apparently the occupiers are looking for more fights among the people, possibly to justify their staying there,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> debate on the uprising that while the army has not succeeded in quelling the revolt, he believed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> eventually would convince <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists they can gain nothing by violence. `` I am convinced that we must n't under any circumstances give in to violence and must use every path to show those that deal in violence they will pay a heavy and painful price,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also said in remarks to soldiers that were broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that the rebellion may last `` another year or two.'' At least 626 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians in the rebellion; 155 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; and 43 Israelis have died. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, six protest marches involving hundreds of people erupted during a two-hour relaxation by the army of a curfew that has been imposed since Friday, Palestinian reporters said. The protesters waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanted they would avenge the deaths of four members of a gang called the Black Panthers who were killed by soldiers on Friday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Eight people were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers in the city's old market, or Casbah, and the nearby <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp, hospital officials said. One victim was a 14-year-old boy shot in the back, the officials said. The army confirmed two injuries. Six Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospitals reported. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> on Wednesday, several hundred Israeli settlers staged demonstrations protesting the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> decision to begin admitting 5,800 Palestinians from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The Palestinians ended up on the Egyptian side of the border when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> returned the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> under the 1979 Camp David peace accords. <PERSON> Datya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershkowitz </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the settlers, accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of admitting people `` trained as terrorists'' during their years in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and described it as `` a birthday present for the uprising.'' The first to be admitted were five men and several sons, who will build houses and then bring the rest of their families.

 The abortion issue increasingly is being felt by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politicians straddling the divide between constituent and conscience as they struggle to mind their church and uphold their oaths of office. `` When I made this decision, I knew the church was n't going to stand up and applaud,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, who first took a stand in favor of legalized abortions in 1974. `` I'm surprised that it took them so long to bring some of this stuff up.'' Some of `` this stuff'' includes a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislator being refused Communion, banishment from a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> church newspaper for politicians who wo n't take an anti-abortion oath, a statement from the bishop's conference last month that for <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> there is no choice. But the crackdown is a relief for many <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who resent colleagues who dissent from the church's teaching on abortion. `` If prominent Catholic -LRB- politicians -RRB- in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were to support the pro-life cause it would certainly prevail,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill. `` They should have done this a long time ago,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bybee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Leaders of the 53 million-member church last month declared `` no Catholic can responsibly take a ` pro-choice' stand,'' and said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislators have a special moral responsibility to work for legislation limiting legalized abortion. This came soon after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave legislatures greater authority in regulating abortions. In a special <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election Tuesday, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> won a narrow victory despite being barred by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> from receiving Communion because of her pro-choice campaign commercials. Her opponent, freshman Assemblywoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, conceded Wednesday she had been defeated by 1,528 votes. Although 2,500 to 3,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said she did n't think they would make a difference. `` It's a stunning victory, a real upset, and it's on the issue of abortion that she won,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bishop shot himself in the foot,'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. `` This is not the role for religion. They should not be getting involved in politics.'' <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s bishops have asked <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politicians not to publicly contradict the church on abortion, and two officials who spoke at an abortion rights rally have been called on the carpet. And in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the diocesan newspaper told politicians they had to sign a pledge supporting a constitutional amendment against abortion if they wanted to advertise holiday greetings. `` My religion will not interfere with what I perceive to be my role in government,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I did not take the oath as an ambassador for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> State Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pignaelli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the church's position that no abortions are justifiable puts officials in a no-win situation. `` What position does a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> take. If a bill comes up that prohibits abortion except if the mother's life is threatened and you vote for it, you are perceived as taking a pro-abortion stance. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislators have one hell of a decision before them,'' he said. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldorf </PERSON> expressed skepticism over the attacks on the bishops' stand. `` I never heard anything about separation of church and state when the bishops were talking about the poor and the hungry. It's only when they talk about abortion,'' <PERSON> Waldorf </PERSON> said Still, many politicans said the bishops' strategy will backfire if they rely on sanctions. `` I think they will be very effective in keeping <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislators away from the Communion rail. As political strategists, they leave a great deal to be desired,'' said <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackbird </PERSON>. Ecclesiastical sanctions have been used sparingly by the church, and with mixed results. When Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> took over as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Casimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> wanted her to resign or publicly oppose abortion. She quit her religious order. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Assemblyman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearie </PERSON> changed his vote on Medicaid funding of abortions earlier this year after being told in 1986 that he would no longer be able to speak at parish events he'd attended since he was a child while he supported public funding of abortions. While the bishops are united in their belief the church has a role in the public policy debate over abortion, they are divided on the value of sanctions. `` For me, taking into account constitutional tradition, the best approach is one of persuasion. ... One has to wonder if such penalties in the long run would not be counterproductive,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arcy </PERSON> of Ft.. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, Ind In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>'s opponent <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, said the bishop's Communion ban `` had an incredible impact on this race In one letter, he created an instant international celebrity and a martyr.''

<HEAD>Government Says Utility Discriminated Against Nuclear Plant Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear power plant worker says he feels vindicated by a ruling that a utility discriminated against him by firing him after he voiced safety concerns about the project. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to rehire <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and give him back pay. The utility operates and partly owns the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> Nuclear Generating Station, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 33, was fired Oct. 12 after being accused of cheating on a training test required by <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the utility could n't substantiate the allegations. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> `` did not cheat on the exam and has been subjected to discrimination by the employer,'' the department wrote in a Nov. 7 letter to the utility and to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> earned about $ 100,000 a year as a radioactive-waste technician. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has n't been rehired and remains unemployed, <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who had worked at <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> since 1982, said the finding was a relief. `` They attempted to destroy me and my lifestyle, and now I feel vindicated,'' he said. `` I've never been known as a liar or a cheater This feels good, I can tell you that.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a Palo Verde spokesman, said Wednesday he could n't comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruling because it was a `` personnel matter and any actions of the case are still in progress. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> declined to say whether the ruling would be appealed. However, <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON> said the utility had appealed it, and a Jan. 9 hearing on the matter has been scheduled before a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency was aware of the case and would ask <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION> for its account of the incident. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigator's report, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was disliked by management for complaining to plant operators and regulators about his safety concerns. Complaints included potential problems with sodium hydroxide that reportedly was leaking into the surrounding water table and that employees were n't qualified to use respirators. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> originally was faulted because he did n't attend required training classes, but the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said plant managers never scheduled <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> to attend the classes. Eventually, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was required to take the exams without attending the training classes, investigator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> reported. During one of those exams, <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> officials said four instructors watched <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> look at small, yellow notes. However, the utility was unable to prove that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had used the notes for a test `` considered to be so easy'' that no one could think of a reason for cheating, <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> acknowledged he brought study notes into the exam with him but said he did n't use them.

<HEAD>White House Says Contras Shouldn't Disband</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Contras `` have no alternative'' but to stay together as a fighting force despite a regional peace accord requiring the Nicaraguan rebels to disband this week, the White House said Wednesday. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government has failed to live up to terms of the pact under which the Contras were to be voluntarily repatriated Under the agreement signed in August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the Contras were to have disbanded by Tuesday, while the Nicaraguan government was to make democratic reforms and promote safe conditions for them to return home. The Contras do not intend to demobilize because `` the conditions do not exist in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'' for them to return, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said they will continue to receive non-lethal assistance from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under a bipartisan congressional agreement that granted them a total of $ 47 million to last until February, when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is to hold national elections. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has cut off military aid, the Contras have continued skirmishing with government troops, with the fighting going on even before <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> announced early last month that it was ending a 19-month-old informal cease-fire. The peace plan signed by the five presidents in August at <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, called for demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5, coupled with democratic reforms by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s leftist government. The agreement also said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would strengthen its internal conditions for national reconciliation, which include elections scheduled for Feb. 25, and would encourage repatriation of the rebels. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, `` The circumstances there do not fulfill the conditions of demobilization as set forth in the Tela accords.'' `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was to provide the conditions that would be conducive for voluntary repatriation. They have not met those obligations. The Sandinistas have broken the cease-fire, have sought to undermine the election process by harassing the opposition.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had denied entry to observer teams and congressional delegations that wanted to monitor election preparations. While <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> welcomed the observer mission headed by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have not looked kindly on some other would-be observers. Reps. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, D-Ga., <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, R-Calif., and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, were denied visas They were representing a 20-member commission named by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to observe election preparations. But the Sandinista government said the group would not be admitted because it was not independent. `` In view of this situation, the Contras have no alternative,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. Cease-fire negotiations were suspended Nov. 21 after the Contras refused to go along with a Sandinista demand for a partial withdrawal of rebel forces to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The Contras declined to go beyond a pledge not to infiltrate more troops from base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas contend 2,300 Contras have infiltrated from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over recent weeks. Their operation from base camps along the Honduran border, where some 6,000 rebels are encamped, has been a bone of contention between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Contras blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for suspension of the talks, saying the rebels were willing to continue efforts to work out an agreement. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> underscored that offer on Wednesday. But Sandinista representatives maintained it was the consensus of all sides involved in the talks that were held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that negotiations were at an impasse.

 <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s parliament Wednesday fell nine votes short of changing the republic's constitution to legalize multiple political parties, the first threat to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutionally guaranteed supremacy in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> The 219-1 vote was shy of the 228 needed for the two-thirds majority, but 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained. The parliament will vote again on the issue Thursday, said <PERSON> Eduardas </PERSON> <PERSON> Potashinskas </PERSON>, an activist who watched a live television feed of the session in the Lithuanian capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. Also on Wednesday, the Armenian legislature failed to draw a quorum large enough to consider a similar constitutional change, said activist <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, green photocopied cards appeared Wednesday in subway stations and main streets calling for a two-hour general strike Monday to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies to rescind the same provision in the national constitution. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and five fellow members of the Soviet legislature signed the appeal. Article 6, which became part of the basic law of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the Constitution drawn up by <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in 1977, makes the Communist Party the `` leading and guiding force of Soviet society.'' Eliminating it would help reduce the party's grip on on all spheres of life. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> recently dropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting special status to their Communist parties. `` Democracy is impossible with the kind of government with a constitution, that sets the inequality of parties, and the inequality of people who are their members,'' Lithuanian deputy <PERSON> Albertas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurinchukas </PERSON> told his fellow deputies, according to <PERSON> Potashinskas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his fellow deputies are calling for the general strike Monday to pressure the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into rescinding Article 6 and voting on draft laws on land, property and business enterprises. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> starts its second semiannual session Tuesday. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> refused to publish the deputies' call for the general strike, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>. `` It is of great importance that Article 6 of the Constitution be abandoned,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the Soviet news bulletin <ORGANIZATION> Interfax </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can not afford to bob in the wake of changes that are taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the parliamentary action was preceded by a similar symbolic strike. Czechoslovak strike organizers publicized their plan through massive demonstrations, wall posters, and direct organizing at factories. There has been little publicity in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s suggestion thus far, so the <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> publication would have been invaluable. Still, <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said, `` The whole country already knows about this appeal.'' She said documents calling for the strike were distributed at a conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Dec. 2 attended by representatives of Voters' Clubs from 60 cities around the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The appeal also was announced at the conference of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s Front, she said. <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON> said he had seen no publicity on <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s strike call in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, located 1,100 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Interfax </ORGANIZATION> as saying that dropping the provision from the Soviet Constitution `` is extremely important in checking the crisis of confidence in the country.'' He said that if the laws on property, land and business enterprises are not considered at this session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, they can not be approved until the next session, six months away. At the least, he said, the constitutional provisions standing in the way of certain reforms should be changed. The Supreme Soviet working legislature is supposed to hammer out new laws, but its parent body, the larger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, must approve any changes in the Constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meets just twice a year. The Supreme Soviet voted last month to place consideration of Article 6 on the congressional agenda, but the proposal failed by a narrow margin. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the centerpiece of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were elected in March in the country's first competitive elections in more than 70 years.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the Chinese democracy movement opened a five-day planning session Wednesday to blunt criticism from the <PERSON> Chinese-American </PERSON> community that they are disorganized. `` Our goal is to overturn one-party rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, not to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. We want to use peaceful, non-violent measures,'' said <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, chairman of the Front for a Democratic <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Front is an umbrella organization of the Chinese democracy movement that has been criticized by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students and residents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as lacking focus. `` We have delegates from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They have all come to decide our future work. It's a very important meeting,'' <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> said. Subjects on the agenda included how to separate personal finances from money donated since the student uprising was crushed by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> Baijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square in June. <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, one of the student leaders in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> now on a one-year fellowship at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, has in particular been criticized by the Chinese-language press in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for allegedly confusing his personal finances with the front's finances. Representatives from Chinese communities around the world were to report in an effort to lay out a specific program for the group's long-term operation. An afternoon, closed-door meeting Wednesday was to consider relations with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` We can not accept Taiwanese independence. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But we have to decide our policy towards <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s democratization and the changes taking place there,'' <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> said `` We want to go to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and see the situation. We ca n't go from the mainland.'' <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON>, founder and former president of a Peking-based computer firm and general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> FDC </ORGANIZATION>, has planned an exploratory trip to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to speak with members of various political groups, including the independent opposition party that was formed in the last few years, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDC </ORGANIZATION> was not thinking about siding with any particular group in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since FDC members include active members of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s ruling party, the Kuomintang, as well as former members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Another item to be addressed was the FDC's policy toward <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The Chinese government has claimed sovereignty there since the 13th century. Tibetans claim to have a different culture and say they should be independent from Chinese rule. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> met this week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled religious leader, to propose a solution for the problem. It involved forming a federation so that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be more like a state, <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, who said he offered the proposal on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> FDC </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> offered no response. FDC leaders said they would present a position when their meetings end Sunday.

Authorities froze bank accounts kept for <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> in this country, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents followed a paper trail left by the records, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The financial and property records were seized by Colombian police during an October raid of a home owned by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s nephew and turned over to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, one of the three leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, is among the 12 Colombian drug traffickers most wanted by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He faces drug-trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` While Mr. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gocha </PERSON> remains at large, he has been shorn of substantial assets provided by the illegal activiites with which he is charged,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` This is not laundered money, this is part of <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s personal financial net and we have taken that $ 61.8 million from <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and his family as part of his personal assets,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>. Lawn said the records showed that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had given $ 81 million to be invested on his behalf by <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vives </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> associate who is at large. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> was able to trace all but $ 20 million, which was transferred into banks in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vives </PERSON> had invested <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s money in certificates of deposits, high-yield stocks and other financial instruments that were kept on deposit in the banks, <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. `` What we were dealing with is a highly sophisticated money-moving operation,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` These were not funds that were being laundered, they had found a home.'' The operation was first disclosed Nov. 7 in congressional testimony by <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, the acting deputy <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. At the time, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> declined to dislose the name of the drug figure whose assets were frozen. Lawn said the records seized from the home of <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> may enable <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to trace the assets of other cartel figures. The attorney general credited unprecedented international cooperation by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the other nations that helped <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> quickly trace the funds and freeze bank accounts kept for <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> containing certificates of deposit, stocks and other financial instruments. `` The timeliness of the asset information provided by the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, its completeness and the speed of transmittal were examplary,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` Swift and decisive action, not bureaucratic delay, was the order of the day,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The attorney general declined to identify any of the banks where <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> kept his money. But <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said none of the financial institutions was under investigation. Authorities in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> froze 10 accounts containing $ 39.4 million and obtained another $ 2 million that had been stashed over the border in West German banks. Also frozen were accounts containing: $ 10.3 million in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, $ 5.9 million in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, $ 4.2 million in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and $ 2 million in this country, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has initiated forfeiture proceedings for the money kept in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounts. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said he expected some the $ 2 million will be shared with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. The rest will go into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury. It was not clear how much of the money in foreign banks would be forfeited. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the laws of the four other nations would determine how authorities in those nations would dispose of the money.

 A 3-year-old boy stabbed by an assailant who killed his mother spent three days trapped next to her body in a bathroom until help arrived, authorities said Wednesday. The boy, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, was taken by his mother into the bathroom in a vain attempt to escape her killer, police said. The child was stabbed five times before his mother, 20-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, herded him into the small room of their apartment. The woman apparently was trying to lock the bathroom door when the attacker shot her in the head, said Detective <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildea </PERSON>. `` The mother fell against the door,'' and the boy was unable to open it, said a police sergeant who identified himself only as <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adorjan </PERSON>. The woman's mother, former fiance and the apartment custodian found the child next to her body Monday after she failed to report to work at an insurance agency, authorities said. Police said they believe the attack took place Friday or Saturday. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> was in good condition Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> `` The first thing he said was, ` I'm hungry,''' said <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarden </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s mother. Though seriously wounded, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> helped police identify a possible suspect, <PERSON> Gildea </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` That's the man that hurt me and mommy,''' when shown a photograph of one of his mother's friends, the detective said. Police are seeking the suspect, <PERSON> Adorjan </PERSON> said.

 Who could predict that little boys would go crazy over Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or that little girls would fall in love with Cabbage Patch dolls? <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> gets paid to try. As senior toy buyer for one of the nation's largest retail variety franchisers, <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> spends hours figuring out what toys will be hits with kids and which ones will end up gathering dust under the bed. His decisions _ based on visits to toy shows, scrutiny of manufacturers' advertising spending and playing with the toys himself _ help determine financial success for <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> variety stores, where toys are big business. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, founded in the 1920s, operates 1,300 stores nationwide. How can a 41-year-old balding, bearded businessman know what kids want? `` You've got to be a child that's never really grown up, you've got to love the product, you've got to love to play with it,'' <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> said Wednesday in an interview from his office in suburban <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stream </PERSON> He also relies on advice from his son, who was 12 when <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> started in the business four years ago and now has inside information on what older kids want. But <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> is the first to admit that getting inside the mercurial mind of a child is n't easy. `` Why is Ninja Turtle popular and Master of the Universe, no one wants anymore?'' he said. `` I will see probably 100 new toy lines each year. Which ones will sell, which ones wo n't is probably anybody's guess.'' Hits this Christmas include thimble-sized vehicles called <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> video games and <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, whose popularity is grounded in tradition, <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> said. Toys based on television or comic-book cartoon characters, like the Ninja turtles and Ghostbusters action figures, are frequently big hits. Those based on movie characters _ like <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> _ often enjoy big but short-lived success, he said. <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> said he looks for toys that will have more long-term appeal. Due to the nature of the manufacturing business, products are promoted to buyers long before they go on store shelves. The American International Toy Fair in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where buyers go to get ideas for what their stores will offer at Christmas, is held months earlier, in February. `` That's the hardest part of the job _ looking at an item in March, and trying to decide what a 7-year old will want in seven months,'' <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> said. In the toy business, `` demand ends rather abruptly,'' he said. Take Cabbage Patch dolls. Five years ago, they were the status symbol of the sandbox set. Stores could n't keep them in stock. But they became passe as their owners aged and financial problems plagued the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> said. But <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> took over the <ORGANIZATION> Cabbage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patch </ORGANIZATION> license and is spending millions of dollars to revive them, he said, predicting: `` Cabbage Patch will make a comback next year.'' Toy manufacturers love that kind of talk, and depend heavily on buyers like <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON>. `` Buyer reaction is critical not only in terms of placing orders, but their input can change a product. They might make a suggestion that could determine the success of a product,'' said <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Toy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the industry trade group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Buyers are the first link with consumers,'' she said. <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> is one businessman who takes his work home. He has several toys of his own, include a collection of radio-controlled vehicles. `` There's some great concepts, great engineering on some of these things,'' he said.

He was 87. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> died of a heart attack at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunshine </PERSON>, a publicist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Authors and Publishers.

Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: `` That Old Feeling,'' `` Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' `` I'll Be Seeing You,'' `` Wedding Bells are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and `` Tender Is the Night'' among them. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> won his Academy Awards for best song, in the title for the 1955 film `` Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' and in 1953 for `` Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film `` Calamity <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> was nominated for Oscars nine times during his career. He was born <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on June 17, 1902. A piano prodigy, he unsuccessfully worked <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> until teaming with lyricist <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON> for their first hit `` Nobody Knows What a Red-Headed Mama Can Do.'' He went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to work in musical films, then returned to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and wrote songs for the smash review `` Hellzapoppin'' in 1938. Two songs from another failed <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> musical that same year, `` I'll Be Seeing You,'' and `` I Can Dream, Ca n't I'' later became wartime classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> wrote all the songs for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune `` I'm Late.'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> also joined with <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> to write the score for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Peter Pan.

 The suspense is over. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> has agreed to return for a seventh season in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-rated entertainment show `` Murder, She Wrote.'' Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> had not planned to return for the 1990-91 season, but <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement for next season, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` Murder, She Wrote,'' in which Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> plays mystery novelist <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> who keeps happening upon murders, is CBS' only hit entertainment show Usually, Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>'s show and `` 60 Minutes'' are the only <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> shows to make the 20 top shows in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. Her return is so important to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> that the network has granted her enormous concessions. The new agreement calls for Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>'s production company to develop a series for next season that she would not appear in. To get her to return for the current season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> financed the establishment of her production company and said she only had to appear in 13 episodes. She makes brief appearances in nine other episodes, which are essentially pilots for other series. That contract also calls for her company to produce several TV movies and 13 episodes of a half-hour series starring Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> after `` Murder, She Wrote'' ends its network run. Her husband, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, run the production company, <ORGANIZATION> Corymore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Another son, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, is a frequent director of `` Murder, She Wrote. Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> said in a recent interview that she wanted to quit the show, but that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was anxious for her to return. Regarding her return for this season, she said, `` They made me a wonderful offer. It was a very difficult decision. I really had made up my mind to leave. It's very hard to walk away from success and a loyal audience. They gave us an opportunity to set up a production company to make a series, with or without me. They were interested in any project I wanted to do.'' Asked then if she would continue the show next season, she said, `` CBS would like to continue it indefinitely. I'm the fly in the ointment. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to that. People around me do n't make it easy.''

 Left - and right-wing politicians battled Wednesday over whether to ban two songs by pop stars about the Palestinian uprising from state-run radio and television Right-wing members of the <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s administrative committee pushed through a ban of `` A Kid Alone,'' by <PERSON> Chava </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberstein </PERSON>, and `` The Flood Can Come After Us'' by <PERSON> Nurit </PERSON> <PERSON> Galron </PERSON>, arguing the songs were `` PLO-like and could damage the morale of the state.'' But after the 4-2 vote Tuesday, the ban was delayed for two weeks pending an appeal by left-leaning members of the committee, said <PERSON> Vered </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Education Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> is part of the Education Ministry. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kor </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the administrative committee, is leading the fight for a ban. `` This is not just music, these are political views,'' he said. `` These songs are against our nation, why do we have to broadcast them?'' added Kor, a member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harel </PERSON>, chairman of the committee, said the effort to ban the songs `` marches the broadcast authority into the dark ages.'' <PERSON> Harel </PERSON> is, like <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, a member of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> planned to hold a hearing on the songs in two weeks and would bring the issuebefore the full <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> or the Parliament. Ms. <PERSON> Galron </PERSON> vowed to fight the ban, saying she believed it was part of an effort to keep information about the uprising from the public. `` In the beginning they tried to cover our eyes, now they are trying to gag us,'' she told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION>. In `` The Flood Can Come After Us,'' already banned on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces radio, Ms. <PERSON> Galron </PERSON> accuses Israelis of indifference to the violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>: `` No, do n't tell me about a little girl who lost an eye `` It only makes me feel bad. `` I do n't like hearing about people oppressed or tortured. `` I do n't care what is happening in the territories. `` We will make love and live our lives. <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> is life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Alberstein </PERSON> was overseas and unavailable for comment. Her song `` A Kid Alone'' is a modern version of a traditional song describing the oppression of the Jewish people. <PERSON> Alberstein </PERSON> sings the almost 1,000-year-old song in the original Aramaic language and then adds in Hebrew: `` How long will the wave of violence continue, `` Chasing and chased, beating and beaten? `` When will this madness stop?''

 Nearly a year after a bomb blew apart <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and killed 270 people, little has been done to improve airport security worldwide, according to a report published Wednesday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, the author of the report and an expert on international terrorism, said obsolete security measures can not detect modern plastic explosives used by terrorists. `` We are way behind in taking the necessary measures that will help to prevent this kind of tragedy happening again,'' said <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, a professor at <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION>. `` Another <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> could happen tomorrow,'' he said at a news conference. Flight 103 exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the New York-bound flight and 11 on the ground were killed. Investigators have said a bomb containing powerful plastic explosives was concealed in a radio-cassette player packed in a suitcase in the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's forward hold. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and passengers and baggage transferred to a larger plane at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on the specific allegations in the report but said: `` Since <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, we have taken a large number of security measures relating to both aircraft and airports.'' The spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the measures include tightened security involving the handling of cabin and hold baggage and cargo on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines operating here and tightened security and pass requirements at all airports. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s report said airlines, airports and governments all are responsible for improving airport security. It said more people have been killed in airport and airplane bombings in the past five years than in hijackings over the past 50 years _ 1,059 compared with 638. `` Many passengers do not apparently realize that aviation terrorism acts now vie with technical failure and pilot error as major causes of fatalities in civil aviation,'' the report said. In the poor countries of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, security `` is no more than cosmetic,'' with airports often lacking equipment and trained staff, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said. Even in wealthy countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, airports are `` full of major security loopholes,'' he said. Passengers are poorly screened, if at all, and not all baggage is accompanied by passengers, he said. He said sophisticated machines capable of detecting colorless, odorless plastic explosives are being tested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and should be refined and installed at airports without delay. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said the continuing lack of preventive measures was demonstrated on Sept. 19 when a UTA French airliner exploded over <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tenere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, killing all 171 people on board. `` The disaster had all the hallmarks of an <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said intelligence and police agencies have failed to coordinate counterterrorism strategies, sometimes because of rivalries. `` This has become all too evident in the welter of international confusion and recrimination over the international hunt for the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bombers,'' he said. Scottish and West German police have denied published reports of poor cooperation in their hunt for the bombers. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said one major lesson from the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> crash is the need to stay one step ahead of terrorists. `` When terrorists find it harder to plant bombs on aircraft they are likely to turn to other tactics such as shooting them down with surface-to-air missiles,'' he said. `` In an age of terrorism, when aviation will continue to be an attractive target of high publicity value to the terrorist, we can never afford to relax our vigilance.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was quoted Wednesday as saying he would give Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the rebellious army commander he fired, two weeks to leave the presidential palace peacefully. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a loose alliance of Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions, called for a general strike Thursday to protest `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s attempts to partition <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a Maronite Catholic like the general, said Moslem army units under Gen. <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>, the new commander, were preparing a plan to invade the Christian enclave where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is entrenched and dislodge him if necessary. Soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> fought Syrian-backed Moslem militias Wednesday for a second day in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and hills above the city. Police reported one person killed and three wounded. The independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> as saying in an interview: `` I'm giving goodwill mediators a week or two to produce fruitful results.'' But he stressed that he will not `` compromise regarding unity of the legal authorities.'' `` The presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> has become a symbol that should not be given away to anyone,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said. He said: `` I and the government will soon rule from <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>,'' an eastern suburb. In another interview published by the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> daily Al-Qabas, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` I prefer to reach the <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> palace carrying an olive branch, but otherwise it will be by the canon.'' Both interviews were conducted at an army barracks in <LOCATION> Ablah </LOCATION> in Syrian-controlled east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> has set up temporary headquarters pending a settlement with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> commands 20,000 soldiers deployed in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON> has won the allegiance of the 22,000 Moslem soldiers based in regions policed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. The Syrians, who control 70 percent of Lebanese territory, fought a six-month war with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops earlier this year. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, named head of an interim military cabinet last year, has rejected a peace plan approved by <PERSON> Lebananese </PERSON> parliament members in October. He says it should have set a specific timetable for withdrawal of Syrian forces and has refused to yield the presidential palace.

 The Finnish exchange student who was moved to a new family in a different town to get him away from his American girlfriend is back with her in the town he considers home, but at the cost of his sponsorship. `` I really do like these people here _ they're so friendly people,'' <PERSON> Iiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said Wednesday. The Education Foundation for Foreign Study transferred <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Kiriviem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, from his host family and school in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on Nov. 11. The foundation said he was spending too much time with his girlfriend, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>, and not enough with his host family. `` I really like her very much. She's ... I ca n't find the words,'' said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. On Tuesday, after much media attention and protests by the teen-agers' parents, friends and the <ORGANIZATION> Finnish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the foundation released him from the program so he could return to <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said he will remain in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> for the rest of the school year with <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldron </PERSON>, who offered to take him in. `` I've never seen <PERSON> Iiro </PERSON> smile so much in my life,'' <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>, 17, said Wednesday. She and her parents drove to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> to pick <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> up Tuesday night. `` We were going to go in the morning, but he said ` come now.''' `` I'm glad it's over and I'm glad he's coming home. He considers Farmington his American home,'' she said. Their forced separation had led to a walkout by about 100 <PERSON> Farmington </PERSON> high school pupils, about one-third of the student body, and angered the couple's parents. `` It was a very big headache and I'm not sure exactly why,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, the foundation's eastern regional director in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>'s parents likely will be reimbursed for the money they gave the foundation to pay for his expenses. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said the financial details have not been worked out. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> will get another type of visa under the Waldrons' sponsorship. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> was taken off the program after officials spoke with his parents in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and agreed that his goals had become incompatible with the program's. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>'s father had lobbied the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s offices in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> in an effort to get his son returned to <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said his father, architecht <PERSON> Kimmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, hopes to visit him in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, just down the street from the LaPointe house, sometime before Christmas. State Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> said he got the good news late Tuesday from <LOCATION> Holliday </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> said an attache at the Finnish embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had been angered when she learned about the transfer earlier. `` She said she was going to call the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> officials and was very irate at the whole situation,'' <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what she said, but it worked. I got the call from <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> a few hours later.'' The relationship between LaPointe and <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> began in September. Foundation officials said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> was not told to break up with <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>, but only to cool the relationship enough so he could spend more time with his host family. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the foundation's regional coordinator in <LOCATION> Berwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said many aspects of an exchange experience, including the student's temporary `` adoption'' by an American family, were overlooked as the story of thwarted young love took on a life of its own. `` I feel confident that the foundation made the right decision, but unfortunately that has become secondary in the eyes of the press to the marketability of a love story,'' she said. According to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>'s original host parents in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, would not see much of him for days at a time. They said he would leave early in the morning for school and return late at night, more like a boarder than a temporary family member. `` The families are volunteers and they expect and perhaps deserve some interaction with the student they are harboring,'' <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> entered the wrenching `` right to die'' controversy Wednesday as lawyers clashed over whether to permit the withdrawal of life-sustaining nutrition from a 32-year-old comatose <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> woman. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, a lawyer for the parents of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, told the justices that if the woman were `` lucid for a moment and could come before this court,'' she would `` choose liberty'' and ask for removal of the feeding tube. But, he said, the woman will never recover. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> countered that Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>'s parents have no right to precipitate their daughter's death _ particularly without `` clear and convincing evidence'' she would choose to die. Letting her die `` goes against the state's interest in preventing suicide,'' he said. The hour-long argument over legal doctrine came in the first `` right to die'' case the court has agreed to decide. No ruling is expected for several months. The justices, who recently have been reluctant to expand individual rights, gave no clear signals on the likely outcome of the case as they peppered the lawyers with questions. The woman's parents, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, attended the hour-long argument session with another daughter and two granddaughters, and he later said, `` It certainly was a very painful thing to sit through.'' The parents want the high court to overturn a <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that bars removal of the feeding tube that is keeping their daughter alive. The state court dismissed statements Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> was said to have made about not wanting to remain alive in a vegetative condition. An estimated 10,000 people in this country are being kept alive in a similar manner. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> said a surgically implanted tube bringing food and water into the woman's stomach should be removed. Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> `` is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for the rest of her life,'' he said. `` All thought and ability to react with the world around her is gone. She will never recover.'' He said if Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> `` was lucid for a moment and could come before this court,'' she would ask for removal of the feeding tube. `` Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in this case,'' the lawyer said. `` She would choose liberty.'' However, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, `` You presume there is a liberty to die without clear and convincing evidence'' of the patient's wishes. On the other hand, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s assistant attorney general whether he thought the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ which barred removal of the feeding tube _ based its ruling on `` the best interests of the patient? `` I have been concerned because it's not clear to me what standard the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> set,'' she said. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said if the court were to decide there is a right for parents to decide between life and death for an incompetent offspring would n't that `` lead inevitably to a right for the state to decide'' as well? Solicitor General <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's top courtroom lawyer, argued that states should be given `` wide latitude to develop approaches that reflect, reasonably, the values of the people ... in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing situation.'' A high court ruling is expected by July. Even if the justices decide there is no constitutional right to die, or that it can not be exercised by a parent or guardian of an incompetent person, states will remain free to let doctors remove life-sustaining treatment from certain patients. But such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it more difficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment. Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> suffered severe brain damage in a car crash nearly seven years ago and is in what doctors call a permanent vegetative condition. Her body is rigid, her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw shapes. She can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are open and move randomly. Doctors say she could live for 30 years or more in her current condition unless the feeding tube is removed. The right-to-die issue attracted national attention in 1976 when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed the family of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe. Ms. <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, in a similar coma-like state, continued to be fed through a tube and lived for nine more years. American courts since generally have permitted removal of life-sustaining treatment for such patients. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates 70 percent of Americans at some time will be involved in a decision about whether to provide life-sustaining medical care for themselves or family members. Forty-one states, including <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, have `` living will'' laws that allow people to pre-authorize the termination of life-sustaining treatment. Missouri's living-will law, which does not allow for removal of feeding tubes, was not in effect when Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> was injured.

 Swiss police said Wednesday they were holding <PERSON> Severo </PERSON> `` Junior'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, said to be among the top Colombian drug traffickers. He is a nephew of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, alleged head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the most powerful drug gang in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. His father, also named <PERSON> Severo </PERSON>, was given a 30-year prison term in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984 on conviction of smuggling 2,200 pounds of cocaine into the country. A police official, who would not let his name be used, confirmed reports that the 30-year-old Colombian was arrested Nov. 29, but would not provide details. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities had yet to receive extradition requests for <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, described in news reports as the top Colombian trafficker in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and four Colombian companions were arrested in a midday raid on a hotel in <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Swiss-Italian </LOCATION> border, where they had spent two months, the French-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> de Geneve reported. It said police seized 6.6 pounds of pure cocaine, described as a sample of a planned delivery of 440 pounds destined for the Swiss and Italian markets. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanguardia </ORGANIZATION>, a Spanish newspaper published in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Severo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s network brought huge loads of cocaine from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for other European markets. It described his capture as a major blow to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The police raid followed seven months of investigations in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geneve </ORGANIZATION> said. Police confirmed that 12 people were arrested in those countries. According to <PERSON> Tribune </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Geneve </PERSON>, police seized nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine with a street value of up to $ 75 million <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, another key suspect in the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cocaine trade, was among those arrested, the paper said. Police declined comment. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was captured in September in connection with the seizure of 825 pounds of cocaine Sept. 20 in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the paper reported. It said two Swiss policemen posed as truck drivers and drove the drugs from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, the arrival port, to <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. Five people were arrested Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Yverdon </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, Tribune de Geneve said. It also reported the arrests Nov. 29 in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> of a member of the Cali cartel, another Colombian drug gang, and a Colombian who allegedly helped amass several tons of cocaine in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION> prosecutor's office said <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities had applied for the extradition of two Colombians held in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Cranston Demands FBI Find Source of Leak in Voter Registration Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> on Wednesday called on <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> to look for a government source for a news story saying the bureau is investigating a voter registration group operated by the senator's son. `` It makes my blood boil to see attempts to smear my son and drag him into the mud,'' the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat said in a statement released at his office. He also urged an investigation of a Republican-financed voter registration group. `` Leaks must not be tolerated among those who are responsible for law enforcement,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` Leaks undermine our legal system.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s statement came in response to a published report that federal law enforcement authorities were investigating the Center for Participation in Democracy, operated by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. The investigation is aimed at determining whether the tax exempt group sought to register more Democrats than Republicans, according to the report which appeared in Wednesday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said in his statement that his son `` has the highest ethical standards I have ever known in anyone.'' `` I know personally from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> of the exquisite pains he took to ensure that registration drives he was associated with were legal, proper and bipartisan,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and four other senators already were under fire for intervening with federal regulators on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> while receiving substantial campaign contributions from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who headed the institution. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> also contributed to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s voter group. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, refused to comment on whether the bureau is conducting such an investigation. But documents released by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted hearings into the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, show that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> material relating to the voter registration groups. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, an examiner for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan, provided the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with copies of documents such as state forms declaring the Center for Participation in Democracy a charitable trust. Meantime, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Giannangeli </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, also said he could not comment on whether there was an investigation of the voter registration groups. `` If in fact the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Participation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, I suggest that it not limit is investigations to groups alleged to be seeking to register potential <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters and that it look into Republican-inspired registration groups as well,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` I also suggest the press likewise make its investigations evenhanded and bipartisan,'' he added. He called for an investigation to determine `` what motivated <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, who was chairman of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984, to found Americans for Responsible Government, which in 1985 became Vote America.'' He described the group as `` a Republican-supported non-partisan voter registration organization.'' `` How much money did he raise for Vote <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or related registration efforts? And from whom?'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> asked. He also called for an inquiry into any connection between `` Republican-inspired registration drives'' and conservative groups such as the Moral Majority, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traditional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Values </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said his voter-registration efforts `` were motivated by a simple principle: The health, indeed the very future, of our democracy depends on the fullest possible voter participation by all segments of our population.''

 Jury deliberations began Wednesday in the manslaughter trial of a Hispanic policeman accused of firing on a motorcycle and killing two black men, setting off three days of racial violence. Rumors swept the city that Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> had been found innocent or was about to be found innocent, court officials said. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s highest-ranking state judge went on live television to deny them. The jury, which got the case after almost seven weeks of hearings and testimony, adjourned for the day at 6 p.m. after deliberating for nine hours. Deliberations were to resume Thursday. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of motorcycle driver <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and his passenger <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. The rumors caused some downtown office workers to leave work early, court officials said. In the unusual live television appearance, Dade Chief Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherington </PERSON> called for calm. `` There is no reason for concern on the part of anybody in the community,'' <PERSON> Wetherington </PERSON> said. `` There is no indication there will be any verdict tonight.'' The judge revealed that the trial judge, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, may seal any verdict and delay announcing it for an undetermined time. Innocent verdicts for police officers accused of killing <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> blacks have touched off violence twice before in this decade. But Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and other officials expressed hope that the presence of two blacks on <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s jury would demonstrate the process was fair, whatever the verdict. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired unnecessarily when <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> on his motorcycle fled a police car after a traffic violation. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said he fired in self-defense when <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> tried to run him down. Deliberations were delayed for almost an hour after prosecutors discovered a typographical error in jury instructions given Tuesday. The written copy in the jury's hands omitted the word `` or'' between two prosecution theories _ that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> committed an intentional act or was guilty of culpable neglgence. The written copy made it appear prosecutors had to prove both, not just one, said Chief Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. The judge, over the objections of defense attorneys <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiden </PERSON>, agreed to insert the word in the jury's written instructions, then denied <PERSON> Seiden </PERSON>'s motion for a mistrial. The judge said the defense had the option of appeal in case of a conviction. The courtroom was sealed so the jurors could deliberate there because the extensive evidence would not fit in the small jury chamber.

<HEAD>Arabs Drop Bid for Recognition of PLO As a Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Arab nations on Wednesday withdrew their bid to have the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recognized as the `` provisional government of Palestine,'' which had prompted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threat to cut off contributions to the world body. A face-saving compromise was played out on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to spare the sponsors the embarrassment of losing a vote on the resolution. Assembly President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> urged on Tuesday that the resolution be withdrawn, and the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> delegations met Wednesday morning and agreed to `` respond positively'' to the appeal, the Arabs announced. In the afternoon assembly session, <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> said `` consideration is indeed postponed'' and banged his gavel, ending a two-week wrangle. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was pleased with the outcome. Arab members expected success when they began the effort to have the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> recognize the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a non-voting member state. As a member of the 102-member Non-Aligned Movement, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> appeared to have more than enough support in the 159-nation assembly. Its representatives now sit at the side of the assembly chamber as observers. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sought elevation in rank to a non-voting observer state, such as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> countered with a threat to halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status was raised. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed $ 216 million annually, one-fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget. European nations began seeking a compromise and support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> waned. In the 22-member Arab group, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> refused to co-sponsor the resolution. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lobbied against it, depriving the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of its usual <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact support. Many Third World nations wondered whether recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a government was a principle worth the loss of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds. In November 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared an independent state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, to be located in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It claims more than 80 nations have recogized the new state. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many Western governments have not extended recognition, on grounds the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state does not have specific borders or a functioning government.

 The Peace Corps is heading to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time to help <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> cope with rapid changes that are creating a need for volunteer teachers, the agency's director said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency expects similar requests from other East bloc countries, including <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, for instruction on everything from health care to business administration, Director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON> said. Talks already are under way with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said. `` There's an enthusiasm that's almost unbridled about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid.

Peace Corps staff members will arrive in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in January, with volunteers expected in June after three months' training in cultural affairs and language. <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to promote the agency's new World Wise Schools program, which has former <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers sharing their knowledge with students about countries in which they've lived The Peace Corps, founded in 1961, relies on volunteers who spend two years helping the people of other countries meet basic needs for health care, food, shelter and education. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>, spokesman for the agency in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has 6,300 volunteers in 66 of the world's 170 countries, or about one-third. <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON> said more than 2,000 people have signed up in recent months for assignments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Volunteers in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will have to subsist on $ 100 a month and live the same Spartan lifestyle as Hungarians, <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> said. `` Once you get out of the facade of downtown <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, people are living different lives,'' he said. <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> called the new assignments exciting and challenging. And he said the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> does not fear ejection once in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by any new governments that might be set up. `` We're on the crest of a wave,'' he said. `` It's important we be there now and seize the moment.'' <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries are having a difficult time adjusting to political reforms brought on by massive, pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other countries. Problems that the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> can help with stem from a poor infrastructure rather than a lack of knowledge, he said. `` The health delivery system infrastructure is suffering great difficulty,'' <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON> said.

 The Communist premier agreed Wednesday to name a new Cabinet including members suggested by a popular opposition that rejects the current government. He said he would quit unless the crisis is resolved. Opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed to deliver a list of ministers Friday. The two had a long, tough negotiating session Tuesday and a brief meeting Wednesday. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, confronted by mass disapproval when he chose a new government Dec. 3, said on television after <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s news conference he would resign if the political crisis continued. The opposition has threatened a general strike Monday if he does not have a new government. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> accepted a list of possible candidates from Civic Forum, the non-Communist opposition group <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> leads, and would consult with other official political parties. It quoted him as saying he probably would meet with Civic Forum again Friday. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said on television he had talked with Civic Forum and other groups, `` but I do n't know if we will reach agreement as far as changes are concerned.'' His television address indicated there had been tough bargaining with the opposition. He said it was difficult to persuade professionals favored by the opposition to join the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in a fluid political situation where the public mood `` changes from day to day and hour to hour.'' Unless the situation calms and the government wins public confidence, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said, he would have no choice but to step down. `` If the government does not have these conditions, I can not take any responsibility for what happens,'' he said. `` In this case, there is only one honest solution for me: to ask the president of the republic to let me resign. `` I feel sorry that, in the event I resign as premier, I wo n't be able to help the society to overcome the crisis,'' he added He did not give a time frame for deciding whether to stay in office. A CTK dispatch said the Politburo of the Slovak republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> resigned in advance of a special Slovak party congress scheduled for Dec. 17 The Czech republic, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s other region, has a new government with a non-Communist majority. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, who held a 75-minute meeting with him Wednesday, agreed with the opposition that `` young, able people and experts who are not discredited'' should be brought into the government. Opposition leaders want such an `` interim government'' to create the legal base for parliamentary democracy and hold free elections in July. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has moved rapidly toward democracy since brutal police repression of a student demonstration Nov. 17 started a mass pro-democracy movement and anti-government protests. In two weeks, the Communists have relinquished their 41-year monopoly on power, reversed 21 years of hard-line policy on the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms of 1968 by condemning the Soviet-led invasion that crushed them, and said free elections are likely next year. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> named a new Cabinet last Sunday, but included only five non-Communists and left Communists in charge of key ministries. At his news conference, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> refused to disclose details of his negotiations with <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>. Opposition sources said some form of power sharing was envisioned, but whether that would lead to a government led by non-Communists, as in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, was not clear. On Tuesday, the first government with a non-Communist majority chosen in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 41 years was named to lead the Czech regional administration. Communists retained the leadership and deputy leadership of the government, along with the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION> and key economic posts. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, Civic Forum spokesman, called the new Czech government `` a step in the right direction.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the latest developments give reformers in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` a chance to demonstrate statesmanship by working with Civic Forum and the Czechoslovakian people to lay the foundation for political reform and a transition to true democracy.'' The Urbanek-Havel meeting was the first between the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and the opposition leader, who only a month ago was a banned, dissident playwright reviled in the official press. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> admitted his party faces `` deeply rooted mistrust'' and must change. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> also assured the opposition the party paramilitary force, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, had been disarmed by the army and probably would be absorbed into the armed forces. The opposition also wants the secret police disbanded. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> acknowledged the secret police `` has lost all its purpose for internal matters,'' but whether it would be dissolved was not clear. As the session ended, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> was heard telling actor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knazko </PERSON>, the opposition leader in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>: `` The most important thing now is to calm people's emotions so that we do n't have a food rationing system tomorrow.'' That indicated the Communists want to resolve the political crisis before it affects the economy and supplies of consumer goods, which are fairly plentiful compared with the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the opposition won another victory when a parliamentary commission investigating the brutality Nov. 17 named ousted party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> as `` politically responsible'' for it. Naming those responsible was among the main opposition demands. On Wednesday, the opposition also demanded new public prosecutors be chosen for both the federal system and Czech region.

 Third World loan losses at big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks and souring real estate markets in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> pushed commercial banking into the red last summer for the first time in more than two years, the government said Wednesday. The nation's 12,824 banks lost $ 744 million in the July-September quarter, off sharply from $ 7 billion in profits in the second quarter and $ 7.3 billion in the first three months of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. For the first nine months, banks earned $ 13.7 billion, almost $ 5 billion less than same period of 1988. The third-quarter loss was the first negative quarter since banks lost $ 10.6 billion in the April-June period of 1987. That loss was also caused by large banks writing off developing country debt. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> issued a new and more pessimistic assessment of prospects for the insurance fund backing bank deposits up to $ 100,000 per account, drawing criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said the fund will shrink between $ 250 million and $ 500 million this year to about $ 13.8 billion, posting the second loss in its history. The fund declined by about $ 4 billion in 1988 when bank failures hit a post-Depression record of 221. This year, bank failures should top 200, but miss breaking last year's record, he said. In September, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> had predicted his fund would break even or post a slight loss. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on financial institutions, said the new estimate shows the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> should be more aggressively regulating commercial banks <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> likened <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> to outgoing savings and loan regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who endured grueling criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for underestimating the scope of the S & amp; L crisis. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> should have spent more time doing his job at the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> instead of running around the country telling everyone what a bad job <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> was doing,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>'s charge was `` simply not true,'' adding that <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>'s only public criticism of Wall has been for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator's decision to shift the supervision of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, from regional examiners in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to examiners in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brooking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, said if banks' unrecognized losses are taken into account the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> probably has reserves closer to $ 9 billion than to $ 13 billion. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> has disputed that assessment, but, <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> noted, `` He's moving closer to reality. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman said he revised his assessment of the insurance fund because of growing bank losses on real estate loans for commercial development and condo projects. He urged banks to exercise more caution in the area. Although bank profits overall likely will bounce back in the final three months of 1989, the number of sour real estate loans will continue to rise, he predicted. `` I do n't want to Scrooge up Christmas ... but I'm afraid the fourth quarter will show a continuation of the -LRB- real estate -RRB- trends we see here,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Over the last 12 months, real estate loan growth has accounted for nearly two-thirds of all bank asset growth, and now comprises almost one-fourth of all commercial bank assets. Delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sour loans nationally, he said. In the Northeast, the percentage of delinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year, he said. The states with the highest percentage of bad real estate loans at the end of the third quarter were <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 12.28 percent; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 10.53 percent; <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, 10.40 percent; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, 6.07 percent; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 5.81 percent; <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION>, 4.76 percent; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 4.24 percent; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, 3.85 percent; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 3.78 percent and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, 3.69 percent. However, the problems in the oil-producing states have been long-standing and are improving. Markets in the Northeast continue to deteriorate. The concentration of third-quarter losses shows the influence of write-downs for developing country debt. Five of the nation's 10 largest banks accounted for $ 5.3 billion loss. Banks in four states loss money: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, $ 5.7 billion; <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, $ 333 million; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 219 million, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, $ 7 million. Banks in 46 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings. Private analysts predicted that several other large banks, most notably <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, could add to Third World debt loss reserves in the next few quarters. They said banks' real estate portfolios would continue to deteriorate and that bank loans for leveraged buyout deals would begin to show up as losses. `` The real estate problem is serious and is dragging what were once considered rather pristine regional banks down into the muck with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions,'' said economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm.

 <PERSON> Mudar </PERSON> <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, the new prime minister, announced a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that does not include the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the largest bloc in Parliament. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> named the 23-member Cabinet after three days of arguments with Brotherhood leaders who demanded they be assigned six key portfolios, including that of education, which is of particular importance in the Arab world. Instead, <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, 55, serving as prime minister for a third time since 1976, chose six moderate Islamists with no ties to the Brotherhood. Islamists are independent, very religious and advocate Islamic influence in society but do not follow a particular party. Islamists were assigned the ministries of agriculture, justice, religious affairs, planning and health. A sixth was made state minister for parliamentary affairs. The Brotherhood said it should have one-fourth of the Cabinet posts because its candidates won 25 seats last month in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s first parliamentary elections in 22 years Independent Islamists won nine seats in the 80-member chamber. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> kept the defense portfolio for himself, and chose <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Massade </PERSON>, deputy prime ministers, for foreign affairs and interior respectively. Other appointments included <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubayideen </PERSON> as justice minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> for education and <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Fareez </PERSON> to head the Industry and <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Izz-Eddine </PERSON> as information minister. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Munem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON>, a leading Brotherhood deputy, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` We have a strong presence in Parliament and we have the right to dictate our condition on the shape of the government.'' Other Brotherhood sources said the group had sought the education, works, social development, labor, higher education and information portfolios. That would have given the group, which advocates stricter Islamic laws, control over `` the direction of future generations'' in the Western-oriented country, a political analyst commented. `` The most important ministry for the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> line is the Education Ministry to safeguard this generation and the future ones from the diminishing Islamic ideologies and social behavior in view of pluralism of non-Islamic thought and ideologies,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON> said. By law, the new Cabinet has to appear before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for a vote of confidence within 30 days. If approved by a simple majority of 41 votes, the government will be installed. If not, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will have to name a new prime minister. In all, there are 13 new faces in the government. Ten served in previous governments and six held posts in the outgoing Cabinet of <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> resigned Monday in accordance with the constitution, which requires the Cabinet that oversaw legislative elections bow out once <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is installed. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>'s government includes six members of Palestinian origin, down from seven in the previous, 24-member Cabinet of <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>.

 Unmarried girls under age 18 would have to get parental permission before obtaining an abortion in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> under a bill passed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> despite the governor's promise to veto it Before passing the measure by a 65-39 vote, lawmakers rejected nearly 50 amendments, including one to require boys to take some responsibility for preventing teen-age pregnancy by wearing condoms. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which already has passed a similar measure, is expected to take up the legislation before it breaks for the holidays next week. That sets up a promised veto by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who has pledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandler </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, said the governor would n't change his mind despite a survey by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that suggests <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> residents favor a parental consent requirement by a 3-1 margin. `` I'm hopeful the governor will think about parents and not his own personal beliefs,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Listing </PERSON>, president of Right to Life of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margy </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said she was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor asking the governor to veto the bill. That is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although the anti-abortion side says it has enough votes for an override in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Legislature has overridden only one veto in the past 38 years, that in 1977 on a obscure administrative rules bill. The legislation allows a girl to petition a probate court to have an abortion if she believes she ca n't tell her parents or if her parents refuse to let her have an abortion. Only two substantive amendments were successful during the lengthy floor debate. One would require schools to provide information about the law and tell girls how they could seek a judge's permission for an abortion. The other would allow a psychologist or psychiatrist who has been treating the child to petition the court on her behalf if they believe the girl would commit suicide if she could n't obtain an abortion without telling her parents. Opponents of the bill say it's merely intended to make it more difficult for girls to get an abortion, because at least 70 percent of pregnant minors in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> already bring at least one parent to an abortion clinic with them. Rep. <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said the bill might encourage girls in tragic situations to resort to desperate measures. `` This bill is meant to put the squeeze on teen-agers with no regard to the horrible alternatives they may seek,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. `` Can any of you live with yourself if a woman resorts to a back-alley abortion, or to crack cocaine to induce abortion, or to suicide? I do n't want any more young people to die.'' `` We're talking about the very bedrock of our society, family,'' countered Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, sponsor of the bill. `` We recognize there are families in trouble, that's why we put the judicial bypass in there.''

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> met with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Wednesday and sounded a note of caution later about German reunification. He flew to <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the Ukrainian capital 465 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, for a six-hour working visit and talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about the political changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Soviet president briefed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on his two-day <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> later told a joint news conference <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must be more firmly anchored to its European partners. `` The evolution of the East must lead the West toward its own structures,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he and the French president had a `` substantial discussion'' on the future of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which divided into two nations after World War II. On Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the West German foreign minister, <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> regards <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a `` faithful ally, important guarantor of peace and stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, he said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s visit had not changed his view. The Soviet position has been that the existence of two Germanys has helped stabilize <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since the war. In restating it, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` Any artificial prodding and pushing of this question -LRB- German reunification -RRB- could only make the processes taking place more difficult.'' He did not rule out the possibility of a unified German in the future, but said the issue was `` not topical'' now. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> holds the revolving chairmanship of the 12-nation European Community. He has voiced support for the possibility of a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but on Wednesday seemed to say <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should participate in moves the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader champions for a more united <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The most urgent question is to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. `` This will establish a new element in the European reality.'' He has pushed for a federal <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that would tie the economies of Common Market nations closer together through monetary union by the mid-1990s, and eventually a single currency. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded both <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in World War II, and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said current German rulers must consider the opinions of other European nations on the reunification issue. It is premature now to think of redrawing boundaries, he said, and appeared to give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a pledge that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would seek restraint from West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on German confederation. `` We should refrain from anything that would poison a quite complex situation,'' he said. `` I have confidence in the German leaders.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> backed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal, made last Thursday, for an all-European summit in 1990 to speed integration of the Continent and eliminate East-West divisions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a `` major world event'' in an increasingly dynamic dialogue between East and West. As the leaders spoke, more than 1,000 Ukrainian nationalists gathered outside on <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> behind police barricades carrying banners reading, `` Down with censorship'' and `` Free all political prisoners.'' A Soviet official said the meeting was held in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> because it is an hour closer to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by plane.

 <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> played <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> again, parting the waters of a fountain, and 25 high school bands blared show tunes as thousands of culture lovers celebrated the Music Center's 25th anniversary Wednesday `` Who is on the Lord's side, let him come to me!'' the bearded <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> thundered from a podium, holding aloft the `` real stick'' he used to part the Red Sea in the classic film `` The Ten Commandments.'' The masses packing the Music Center plaza cheered as walls of water rose up on either side of the plaza's central sculpture. `` It worked,'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said. The birthday celebration was held exactly 25 years after the <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavilion </PERSON> opened on Dec. 6, 1964, with <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> conducting the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jascha </PERSON> <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON> as the soloist. The $ 34 million center was completed in April 1967 with openings of the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre, giving a home to performing arts in a city maligned by denizens of colder climes as a cultural wasteland. The seven-acre center was built at the civic center with $ 20 million in private donations raised by <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> and $ 14.5 million covered by a lease agreement with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In contrast to the formal opening night years earlier, the throng of noon revelers feasted on birthday cake and drank cartons of milk under a brilliant 80-degree sky that <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Moses </LOCATION> tone, took credit for. The round Mark Taper Forum was dressed like a birthday cake complete with red candles sticking out of the roof. Visitors took tours and the <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taper </ORGANIZATION> offered a free performance of <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Capote </PERSON>'s `` A Christmas Memory.'' The high school bands, led by a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> band, played the title song from `` The Phantom of the Opera'' and `` Seventy Six Trombones'' from `` The Music Man.'' Actress <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>, introduced to the strains of `` Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,'' presented her `` diamond awards'' to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabarum </PERSON>, president of the county <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at the Mark Taper. `` All good work is rewarded with diamonds,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>. She recalled how she and the company of `` Hello Dolly'' broke its original Broadway engagement to perform at the new <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavilion </PERSON>. `` It was one of the thrills of our lives,'' she said. The story triggered a memory for <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a 10-year <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> employee in the crowd who had gone to that engagement of `` Hello Dolly.'' `` I stood eight hours in line for a ticket. Then I sat on the very top row of the balcony,'' she said, expressing disbelief it had been so long ago. Construction began on the elegant, 3,197-seat <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavilion </PERSON> in March 1962, and was finished 2 -LCB- years later. The 742-seat Mark Taper opened on April 9, 1967, with `` The Devils,'' starring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Langella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanders </PERSON>. The 2,071-seat <ORGANIZATION> Ahmanson </ORGANIZATION> opened three days later with <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> in `` More Stately Mansions.'' In addition to the Philharmonic and <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which develops experimental works at the Taper and classical dramas and comedies at the <ORGANIZATION> Ahmanson </ORGANIZATION>, other companies are the Music Center Opera, <ORGANIZATION> Joffrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LA-NY </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Master Chorale and the Music Center Education Division.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS said the nation's health care system needs urgent repair to deal with the crisis and underscored that point Wednesday by sending its report to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight months early. `` A series of problems have resulted in a health care system singularly unresponsive to the needs of HIV infected people,'' the commission said in its report to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The commission said that because infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, appeared initially in `` groups often shunned by the larger society,'' including homosexuals, the poor, minorities and intravenous drug users, the national response to the AIDS epidemic has been slow. The commission cited a lack of training support for primary care physicians to treat people with HIV infection and AIDS, and financial disincentives for physicians to treat Medicaid and other poor patients. `` The commission believes it is time to match rhetoric with action,'' said the report by the panel created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to advise the president and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on AIDS issues. Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> sits as a non-voting member of the commission, did not participate in writing the report and a spokesman for <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> took issue with the report's criticism of national leadership it says is lacking. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has expressed concern about some of the same issues addressed by the commission's report. However, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` there has been leadership from this department and there will continue to be.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> cited among the department's AIDS activities education programs, drug research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and federal funding under Medicaid to treat people with AIDS. But the report said more needs to be done. `` It is essential that everyone be afforded early intervention and access to care,'' the report said. The report estimated that direct medical care for people with AIDS in 1991 will cost from $ 2.5 billion to $ 15.1 billion. It notes the range is from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of total health care spending in the nation, and adds, `` We simply must be prepared to make these expenditures.'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, vice chairman of the commission, said these costs are affordable. `` I think we've done a disservice to say these are astronomical costs and that we ca n't handle them. Of course we can,'' he said. The commission was required to draft its first annual report by August 1990. But, in a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accompanying the report, commissioners said testimony they heard at their public hearings `` was so compelling we felt it is vital to write to you now.'' Copies of the report were also given to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Federal health officials say 112,241 cases of AIDS have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since June 1981, and 66,493 of them have died. More than 1 million Americans are believed to be infected with HIV now, and the commission said that over the next four years, AIDS is likely to claim 200,000 lives. `` The HIV epidemic is not just a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> problem as some would like to believe,'' the report said. Though those cities continue to have a heavy load of AIDS cases, by 1991, experts estimate that 80 percent of new AIDS cases will come from outside those two cities, the report said. The epidemic is infecting a disproportionate number of blacks and Hispanics and is expected to take an increasing toll on women and children in coming years, the report said. While new drug treatments can prolong the lives of people with HIV infection and AIDS, `` scientific breakthroughs mean little unless the health care system can incorporate them and make them accessible to people in need.'' The commission cited a 1987 survey that showed nearly one quarter of all AIDS patients have no form of insurance, private or public.'' Additionally, those on Medicaid run into barriers because low reimbursement rates are a disincentive for physicians to treat Medicaid patients, the report said. `` For example, a new patient intermediate office visit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is compensated by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> at $ 78, by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> at $ 80 and by Medicaid at $ 7,'' the report said. What's needed, the commission said, is `` frank recognition that a crisis exists in many cities that will require extraordinary measures to overcome.'' The panel recommended creation of a `` flexible, patient-oriented comprehensive system of care, closely linking hospital, ambulatory, residential and home care.'' The report also says the administration should consider creating regional centers to provide back-up and consultation to primary care physicians treating AIDS patients. It also calls for creation of units for treatment of HIV patients who are also drug addicts. Commission members also expressed `` surprise and disappointment'' that the White House National Drug Control Strategy gives little attention to the problem of AIDS spread by IV drug users sharing needles.

 A man bleeding from a head wound stumbled across broken pavement, through smoke from fires started by the most powerful bombk since a wave of terrorism by drug traffickers began. He was too stunned to cry for help and rescue workers were too busy with more serious cases to assist the victim, one of hundreds injured in a bombing that claimed 35 lives Wednesday. The violence sometimes has overwhelmed the ability of this nation to cope. Rescue workers were pushed beyond their capacities this time, so the wounded man went unattended. There were more serious cases. The truck bomb outside the headquarters of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s secret police injured hundreds of people and wreaked havoc in a five-block area. Police helicopters swooped down. While rescue workers ran with stretchers to damaged buildings, some pedestrians strolled quietly past blackened shells of cars twisted by the power of the blast. The body of a passenger lay unnoticed, sticking out partly onto the roadway. People ran behind ambulances or waited against hattered facades of buildings for rescue workers to find their relatives in the rubble. One man stood crying beside a heap of bent metal while firehoses hissed and smoke climbed into the air. He was beside what was left of a hardware store belonging to his 26-year-old daughter and his son-and-law, who were in the building at the time of the blast. When firemen pulled out the remains of his daughter, burned and mangled, the man raised his hands over his head. `` <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, my little girl, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>!'' he screamed. He repeated the name, over and over. Moments later, a stretcher passed with the body of his granddaughter. Her patent leather shoes extended from a bloody sheet. His son-in-law's body came out next. Shock turned to anger for some onlookers. `` How could anyone think of negotiating with those monsters?'' one man said. Some Colombians have said negotiations with drug traffickers are the only way to end such violence.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> described as a `` great step forward'' on Wednesday the acceptance by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan offered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> should meet quickly to determine the composition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the agenda of such talks. `` I bless it. ... I see the positive Egyptian response as a great step forward, toward the implementation of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace plan,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it had received a `` positive'' response from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> raised the possibility of a trilateral meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early next year to work on details. `` We will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to a trilateral meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as part of the process for launching an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue,'' she said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s framework calls for a preliminary dialogue in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, between delegations of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> so as to advance the Israeli-offered plan of elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In other <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> developments Wednesday: _ <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and former secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, ended a three-day official visit to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> after brief talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on the prospects for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. _ President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s support for a U.N.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace conference, despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> efforts to arrange more limited negotiations His comments came in a meeting in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and former Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who are on a study tour of the region. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s acceptance, `` The moment <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, in addition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, gave a positive reply, there is no obstacle, and we should not examine their response as we wo n't agree to them examining our peace initiative `` The moment the answer is positive in principle, we should move forward toward the meeting of three ministers who should determine the composition of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation and what will be on the agenda.'' His comments contradicted an earlier statement by <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Amihud </PERSON>, who said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> first wanted to see a written version of the Egyptian response to examine it. The discrepancy could be explained by ideological differences between Labor and the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Labor favors a territorial compromise with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and is ready to offer concessions. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> views the occupied lands as an integral part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, contrary to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s stand, indicated he did not oppose an indirect <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> role in the process, saying: `` Today there are three partners to the move, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Whomever one of them talks to, it's their business.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> expressed hope <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would not torpedo the negotiations. Many problems remained unresolved even after <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s acceptance of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s peace framework. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> indicated that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> specified some conditions, as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had done earlier. She said that `` in their responses, both <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have conveyed certain views and positions on this process.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accepted the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan but sought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ viewed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a terrorist group _ would play no role in the peace process. It also wants the agenda limited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s elections proposal, which says negotiations would be held with elected representatives on limited autonomy for 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants a broader agenda so <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for independent statehood can be raised. It also wants to take part in selecting the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for the dialogue with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the Egyptian response also apparently contained such a condition.

 Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ability to survive politically is in doubt and may depend on how seriously she takes the lessons of the coup attempt against her, a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official said Wednesday. `` She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' said the official, who briefed a small group of reporters on the condition he not be named. It was the first time since the military rebellion began Friday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had voiced concerns about the mutiny's long-term effects on <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s future The official spoke a little more than an hour before news came from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that rebel troops holding a downtown district had agreed to return to their barracks. The administration official, in an apparent attempt to send a clear signal to <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must now `` reassess what all this means'' in terms of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to her government. He did not elaborate. But the official called the insurrection a `` serious'' attempt to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and said she should regard it as such. He called on Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to seek to `` eliminate the sources of discontent which helped lead to the coup'' as she struggles to reassert control. Asked if <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could survive politically if she succeeds militarily in putting down the rebel forces, the official said: `` That's a tough one. `` There has been a lot of criticism of her from the army'' for not giving military leaders more of a free hand in cracking down on the leftist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and for `` ignoring the military,'' the official said. `` I do n't know if it's justified or not. It is what they believe,'' he went on, adding that the criticism is `` a symptom of feelings. And, as a political leader, she has to deal with it.'' It is elements of <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s own army that are rebelling against her now. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official noted that the restiveness in the military gave Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, a leader of the coup attempt, far more support over the last week than he had when he led a previous effort to oust Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Earlier, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials praised as `` careful and effective'' a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> evacuation that freed 280 Americans and other foreigners from the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> hotels where they had been trapped by gunfire in the six-day-old rebellion. `` We commend the Aquino government for organizing and carrying out this operation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, applauding the `` careful and effective manner in which it dealt with the situation in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> commercial district and the efforts it took to safeguard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and others who were in the area.'' The evacuation followed negotiations between the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government and the rebels `` into the early hours'' of Wednesday to reach a cease-fire, she said, but declined to comment on restraint shown by the rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had no contact with the rebels, she said. `` It's unfortunate that the rebels caused this situation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We are obviously not going to get out here in a position and applaud the rebels. We are applauding the Aquino government.'' All those trapped in the hotel district were freed without injury, she said, and were taken by bus to processing centers set up by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to help them contact relatives and make lodging and travel plans. `` While the situation has improved, we continue to urge <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens to exercise caution,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s declaration of a state of national emergency was `` totally, legally what she has done under their constitution,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, declining further comment on the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government's response to the week-old rebellion. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also declined comment on the emergency declaration other than to say, `` We will take a look at it and see if we have any concerns.'' Some 2,000 foreigners had been trapped for four days in hotels by the military coup attempt that had left at least 79 dead and 570 wounded since Friday.

 A service aboard the USS Arizona Memorial highlights ceremonies Thursday to mark the 48th anniversary of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, which plunged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into World War II. The sunken <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> is the final resting place for 1,102 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men and Marines killed in the early morning attack Dec. 7, 1941. The memorial spans the hull of the battleship, which still flies the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. It is the only <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship not in commission that is allowed to do so. The memorial service would include prayers, presentations of wreaths, a 21-gun salute and the playing of echo taps. A moment of silence would be observed throughout the naval base at 7:55 a.m., the exact moment of the Japanese attack. To end the minute of silence, F-15 jets from the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will fly over the memorial in a `` missing man'' formation. Because of limited space aboard the memorial, attendance is by invitation only, but numerous survivors of the attack and members of various veterans and patriotic groups are expected to be on hand. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the memorial and its nearby visitor center, will hold a simultaneous observance on shore for the general public. The park service planned special activities Thursday, including lectures by survivors, special exhibits and footage of the attack. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> is to perform later in the day. A memorial ceremony is also scheduled at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terms </ORGANIZATION> refused <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>'s latest bid for freedom after a 2 -LCB- - hour hearing at the prison where he is serving a life sentence in the 1976 The denial was based on <PERSON> Schoenfield </PERSON>'s crime, `` which was carried out in an especially heinous, atrocious, cruel and callous manner which exhibits a disregard for the life or suffering of another,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the three-member board. <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>, 37, who was sentenced in 1978, will be eligible for parole again in December 1990, Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> were convicted of the July 15, 1976, abduction of the <LOCATION> Chowchilla </LOCATION> school bus driver and 26 children headed home from summer school. The children ranged in age from 5 to 14. The kidnappers placed the youngsters and bus driver in a moving van buried at a rock quarry near <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, almost 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Chowchilla </LOCATION>, which is 240 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The prisoner and crime partners kidnapped at shotgun point 26 youngsters and their school bus driver and transported them 100 miles away to a buried van,'' Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The youngsters and driver escaped after 17 hours in the sweltering van, 28 hours after their abduction. The van was equipped with a single air vent to allow the group to breath underground. The <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> brothers and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> were members of prominent <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> families and said in pre-sentencing reports that they planned to seek $ 5 million ransom. They were thwarted in telephoning their ransom demands to authorities in <LOCATION> Chowchilla </LOCATION> because the telephone lines were tied up constantly by law enforcement officials and reporters the day after the kidnapping. The board also denied parole based on a psychological evaluation of <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> in September, Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. She would not provide details of the evaluation. During the hearing, the panel commended <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> for his good behavior and his excellent work record as a vocational drafting clerk, Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> also received life terms and have been denied parole periodically.

<HEAD>Cambodian Guerrillas Report Taking Two Key Towns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guerrillas fighting the Cambodian government said they seized two key towns near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border Tuesday and Wednesday, killing dozens of soldiers and opening the way for an attack on a military operations center. The report, if confirmed, would appear to represent the biggest guerrilla victory over the Vietnamese-installed government since communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rebels seized the rich gem-mining town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> further south on Oct. 22. The guerrillas said they captured <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chek </PERSON> on Tuesday night and Treas on Wednesday morning. The towns in northwestern <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> province lie along Route 69, leading to the military operations center at <LOCATION> Sisophon </LOCATION>, 16 miles south of <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION>. No immediate comment came from the government on the combat report. <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sereywath </PERSON>, spokesman for Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s guerrilla forces, issued a statement saying 747 fighters of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s group and 300 from the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> attacked Treas and captured two Soviet-built T-54 tanks and one 122mm artillery piece. He said resistance forces seized seven tons of ammunition. The resistance coalition consists of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s forces, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. About 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas attacked <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chek </PERSON>, said Gen. <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON>, deputy commander of the Front's army. He said many government soldiers died and that `` six to seven'' guerrillas were killed and 30 wounded. `` We captured more than 1,000 weapons. We have been trying for more than a month to take <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chek </PERSON>. This is a big victory for us,'' said <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON>, reached by telephone at the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION>. On Nov. 27, government forces repulsed the guerrillas from positions around <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> seized by the government the day before. The official state radio said 50 guerrillas died in that attack. The guerrillas are fighting forces of the government that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after invading <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ousting a brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime. The guerrillas have made important advances in battlefields bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> since late September, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said it withdrew the last of its troops. The guerrillas say they want to force the government back to peace talks with more flexibility on the issue of sharing power with the guerrillas. <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> said the guerrillas destroyed bridges to cut a section of national highway running from the national capital, <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Siem </PERSON> <PERSON> Reap </PERSON>, the northwestern provincial capital 140 miles away. The highway is used to transport troops and supplies to northwestern battlefields. The claim could not be independently confirmed.

<HEAD>Former Regulator: Bush Son On Board Stalled Closure Of Troubled S&amp;L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials delayed closing a troubled <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> savings and loan largely because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son was on its board, a former federal bank regulator charged in a published report Wednesday `` <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presence was a material part of unconscionable delays in taking over <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> is a former staff analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which supervised <ORGANIZATION> Silverado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The head of the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> bank at the time denied that <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presence was an influence `` The economic substance of <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s loan portfolio was comparable to a Ponzi scheme -LRB- a type of pyramid investment fraud -RRB-, and it could n't have worked out,'' said <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON>, 42, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer who left the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> bank after six months in 1986. `` It was insolvent back -LRB- in 1986 -RRB-. It was not a judgment call. That place, clearly, was very insolvent,'' <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> resigned from <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s board just after his father won the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination in 1988 and only four months before the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L's seizure. The Chronicle also reported that documents it obtained show top federal regulators knew the thrift's financial situation was bad enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at least 14 months before it was closed Dec. 9, 1988. <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> said he believes a big reason his district superiors, including former <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> bank president <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowbray </PERSON>, allowed <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> to continue was their knowledge that <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund raiser <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizel </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, were involved with the institution. <PERSON> Mowbray </PERSON>, who retired the month that <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> closed, denied <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON>'s allegations Tuesday, saying: `` <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> being on that board had no effect on our decisions.'' <PERSON> Mowbray </PERSON>, who said he never met <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, also denied knowing that <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> was insolvent in 1986. In 1986, <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> said he approached a fellow supervisor and asked: `` Why are we putting up with this <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>? We would not permit that type of loan work-out for another institution.'' `` And he looked at me, and said, ` Well, you know who one of the directors is.' And I said, ` No.' And he said, ` The vice president's son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> told the Chronicle. However, he said he has no evidence that either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mizel </PERSON> exerted direct pressure for `` the preferential treatment they got.'' He said their presence was enough to cause <PERSON> Mowbray </PERSON> to take an extraordinary interest in <LOCATION> Silverado </LOCATION> and to proceed cautiously in the case. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reached by telephone at his office in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm going to cooperate in any way I'm asked to It would be inappropriate for me to get into any details except with authorities investigating <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>.'' In a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked whether the president was concerned that <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s collapse might have have been partly due to regulators who were `` fearful of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` These matters are all under investigation and consideration and we wo n't offer any comment on any aspect of it. I might say, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>'s been off that board for a long time.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Friday.

<TEXT>
 The military issued its first warning Wednesday in the turmoil that has convulsed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and a non-Communist took over as head of state to end a 40-year lock the Communists held on the presidency. The government reported signs that angry citizens were storming army installations, and military leaders pledged to repel any attempts to seize weapons and munitions. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, replaced <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as interim president, the first time a non-Communist had become president since <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s founding in 1949. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>'s party recently broke off its long alliance with the Communists after weeks of spearheading reforms. The Communists advanced their emergency session one week to Friday to overhaul the party's structure. Shedding such `` Stalinist'' operations as the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and ruling Politburo is one possibility. Breaking up the party is another. In seven weeks, the country has faced a virtual revolution that first ousted a hard-line leadership and then threw out senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chiefs. A 25-member committee of Communists now runs the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in charge of the armed forces, quit on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the leadership of the once-dreaded secret police quit. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported late Wednesday the suicide of an official caught two days earlier trying to leave a government building with two suitcases stuffed with East German and West German money. ADN did not give his name, but said he was connected to the case of fugitive <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, the former top East German foreign trade official accused of running a weapons-selling ring. Early Thursday, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinz </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> was in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prison after an international manhunt. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said he had turned himself in to authorities late Wednesday but did not elaborate. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network reported <ORGANIZATION> Schalck-Golodkowski </ORGANIZATION> planned to pay back $ 31 million to the East German government from Swiss bank accounts. He is suspected of having smuggled several times that amount from the country, according to reports on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state television. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in that scandal-plagued office, was arrested on suspicion of having smuggled $ 110 million out of the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, a small party that recently broke with the Communists, said growing financial scandals were making <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> look like a `` banana republic.'' The government announced a partial amnesty Wednesday, following hunger strikes spreading to penal institutions nationwide. It applies to those sentenced to three years or less and excludes prisoners convicted of `` rowdiness,'' a term once applied to pro-democracy demonstrators but also sometimes used for more serious offenders. The reform movement exploded here after hard-liner <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted following 18 years as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. Since then, a popular uprising and a flood of refugees to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> forced the government to open <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> to let citizens travel freely. East Germans also have been promised open elections, but the country's overall direction remains unclear. Pro-democracy opposition groups so far lack the coordination to fill the power vaccum left by the Communists' hasty retreat. For days, reports surfaced of furious citizens barging into secret police offices, including storming one building in the southern city of <LOCATION> Gera </LOCATION> on Wednesday. A citizens committee pressing for reforms in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> occupied regional state security headquarters there on Monday, and an <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> report suggested the activists still controlled the building. The assaults were meant to stop destruction of documents needed in prosecuting former Communist officials. An investigative commission recommended criminal charges against former secret police boss <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON>, 81, for police attacks against demonstrators in October that touched off the revolutionary changes. The government, headed by reformist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, said late Wednesday `` indications'' emerged that people were storming army installations. No details were given, but the government appealed for `` calm and restraint.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leadership issued its own statement, addressed to both soldiers and citizens, saying: `` Such intrusions could cause danger for the security of the German Democratic Republic. `` Illegal entry to weapons, munitions and fuel will be blocked.'' Military leaders expressed `` concern for securing peace'' and pledged to work with Soviet and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces to secure peace in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Only together can we preserve the sovereignty of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and protect our country from anarchy and chaos,'' they said. The government's appeal for calm was the top item on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main TV news program, which said <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders joined the call. The program said `` the church has information making it increasingly concerned about calls for revenge ... that the search for the guilty has frightened many people.'' In resigning, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> warned of `` anti-socialistic forces'' filling the nation and called for a joint effort to repel them. `` In this hour of greatest danger all those who love this country must stand together out of patriotic duty.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> quit as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief on Sunday. Opposition leaders and members of his own party said he was too tainted by scandals of the <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> era to guide the nation out of its economic and political crisis. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, looking somber, announced his appointment on TV, saying he was `` not glad'' about taking on the duties. He will serve as president until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> picks a permanent replacement. Speculation grew that another non-Communist would take over permanently, although <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> ruled himself out. The presidency is a largely ceremonial but highly visible post. The president routinely represents the country on foreign trips.

<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas on Wednesday released an American helicopter mechanic they had held prisoner with his thumbs tied behind his back for 22 hours, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, had reported on their clandestine radio what they described as the brief detention of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. The insurgents identified the man as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and said he was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military adviser. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the man's surname is not <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, but declined to identify him, citing the privacy act. He also said the man is not an adviser, describing him as a civilian helicopter mechanic under contract to the 55 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers based in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The rebels said on Radio Venceremos they detained the American late Tuesday at a guerrilla roadblock on the capital's western edge, in the affluent <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> neighborhood. <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> has been the scene of sustained combat twice since Nov. 11, when the insurgents launched their largest offensive of the 10-year-old civil war. Both times, after invading the neighborhood for several hours, they retreated up the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano that looms over the capital's northwestern sector. The guerrillas said the man and a Salvadoran woman companion were briefly questioned and released. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the man was indeed detained in upper Escalon, but was held from 7:30 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday. He said the man's car was stolen and he was forced to stand for `` several hours.'' His thumbs were tied behind his back while he was held, he said. The rebels have reiterated repeatedly in recent months they do not consider non-military <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel objectives in their war against the government. Guerrillas occupied the houses of several <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families last week during an incursion into <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON>, but called a truce to permit their evacuation.

 <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> quickly took up the call for reforms as the once-monolithic East German power structure began to crumble in October. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief became the country's first non-Communist president. In the anything goes world of East German politics, the 61-year-old <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> was able to maneuver himself out from the Communists' shadow into national prominence. The Communists for decades counted four smaller parties as their allies, among them <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>'s Liberal Democrats. The `` national front'' that bound them together routinely picked up more than 99 percent of the vote in government-controlled elections. The system gave the country at least an outward semblance of democracy despite the hard-line leadership. In reality, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ran the show and no one challenged it. That all changed on Oct. 7, as party chief <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> faced huge street protests and heard a stern warning from visiting Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that `` he who is late is punished.'' Less than two weeks later, the 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was out and his protege <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was in, this time with a vague promise of free elections. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, a gray-haired, professorial-looking lawyer, quickly took up the cause of free elections and other causes as well. He demanded an end to Communist monopoly on power and greater openness in society. He insisted that officials look into why tens of thousands of people were fleeing the country. The three other parties _ <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> _ quickly joined in the calls for reform, but by then <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> was well out in front. That seeming overnight conversion is n't without its detractors. `` The four parties are acting as if they were seduced virgins who are now trying to run away from the big, bad <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' opposition leader <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppellmann </PERSON> said last month. Still, <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>'s composure and outspokenness won him supporters, as he appealed for greater tolerance and denounced anti-Semitism. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 17 that his party was breaking from the Communist alliance and called for a `` true sharing of power'' in free voting. But he also made it clear in a television interview that `` we are a party socialists in a socialist system.'' `` The task before us now is to define what socialism means and how we can make it meet the needs of the people.'' The insider-turned-outsider saw his main wish come true last Friday when the Communist-dominated parliament scrapped the party's leading role in society Even within the fast-forward pace of change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, that was record time _ with the results due in part to <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>. It has paid off. A public opinion poll conducted in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would reach second place, behind the huge and sometimes unwieldy New Forum movement, if free elections were held today. The Communists would be third, the poll said. Despite the success, a somber <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> said he was `` not happy'' about taking on the new duties as head of state. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> indicated he would n't actively seek to hold on to the job when the parliament fills the presidency on a permanent basis _ but it seemed certain that the equivalent of a `` draft'' would keep him on as president. While the job's powers are limited, the East German president does represent the country on foreign visits. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>'s stature and demeanor are probably just what's needed abroad for a country that his allies, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, say is reaching `` banana republic'' stage. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> had already been serving as the country's vice president, before Wednesday's vote. A Liberal Democrat since the end of the war, <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> also served as mayor of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> in the 1950s. In addition to <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, the parliament also has a non-Communist chief. Farmers Party chief <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON> was elected speaker on Nov. 13.

 Academy Award-winning composer <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, who wrote such enduring tunes as `` Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' `` That Old Feeling'' and the wartime classic `` I'll Be Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87. The two-time Oscar recipient, who suffered a heart attack, was at the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when he died, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunshine </PERSON>, a publicist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Authors and Publishers. During a career that stretched from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Tin Pan Alley to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> wrote some of the most memorable pop hits of American music this century. Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: `` Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' `` I'll Be Seeing You,'' `` Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and `` Tender is the Night'' among them. `` ` I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that. But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> of the World War II song. `` It's hard for me to believe I wo n't be seeing him anymore. He was such a sweet person, such a gentle person,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>'s collaborators over the years included lyricists <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, E.Y. <PERSON> Hapburg </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> did n't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear. He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful standard melodies,'' said lyricist Parish in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The two men wrote `` You're So Indifferent'' for <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> and another tune, `` In a Little French Cafe.'' `` When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he did n't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. `` We wrote songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets. Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs. ... That explains why these songs are still alive.'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> was nominated for 10 Academy Awards during his long career. He won for best song for the title tune from the 1955 movie `` Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for `` Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film `` Calamity <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>.'' Known for a self-effacing style, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>'s modesty even extended to Academy Award politics. When he had a little-heard 1976 Oscar-nominated song, `` A World That Never Was,'' from a little-seen movie called `` Half a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in a trade paper advertisement: `` It would be nice if we had a commercial record, but we do n't. It would also be nice if we were in a widely seen motion picture, but we do n't have that, either.'' To make up for those shortcomings, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> provided a `` Dial-a-Song'' phone number so Academy voters could hear his song. But the award went to `` Evergreen'' that year. Born <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on June 17, 1902, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> was a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked <ORGANIZATION> Tin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alley </ORGANIZATION> until teaming with lyricist <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON> for their first hit, `` Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.'' He went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to work in early musical films, including `` Dames,'' `` Footlight Parade,'' and `` Goin' to Town,'' then returned to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and wrote songs for the smash review `` Hellzapoppin'' in 1938. Two songs from a failed <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> musical that same year, `` I'll Be Seeing You'' and `` I Can Dream, Ca n't I,'' later became wartime classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters. Back in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> after the war, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> wrote all the songs for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune `` I'm Late.'' He also joined with <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> to write the score for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>,'' which included the tune `` Second Star to the Right,'' and wrote music for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Rescuers'' in 1977. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and was presented earlier this year with a special award from <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> for lifetime achievement. He had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> board of directors for the past 10 years. He is survived by a son, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Funeral arrangements were pending.

<TEXT>
 Nationalistic fervor whipped up by the government is turning the title fight Thursday between Sugar <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> into a symbolic political clash. The fight comes at a low point in <LOCATION> Panama-United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> relations, with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government continuing economic sanctions in a bid to force the ouster of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and de facto leader. A coup that began with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support was botched in October. `` For <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, I am going to beat that loudmouth,'' <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> said in a television advertisment, in which he also asks fans `` to be smart and bet on me.'' This capital city is expected to come to a standstill Thursday night during the live television broadcast of the fight. Giant screens are being put up in low-income neighborhoods to make it easier for fans to watch and cheer <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>. A radio announcer warned Tuesday that the Defense Forces should be alert because it would be the best time for an invasion by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. But many of the nearly 12,000 soldiers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also will be watching the fight. `` You can imagine whom I'll be rooting for,'' a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer said. `` Leonard.'' The fight, at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, has joined government officials and opposition leaders in wishing that the durable <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, known as `` Mano de Piedra'' or `` Hands of Stone,'' wins his fifth world crown. A popular novelty item is a baseball hat with <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>'s name and four embroidered crowns. `` I am going to put the fifth one here,'' a fan told a television interviewer, pointing to the center of his hat. The nationalistic fever was boosted this week by <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> when he called sports officials to say that <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> officials had forbidden the singing of the Panamanian national anthem before the fight. Sanctions forbid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to deal commercially with people, companies or agencies associated with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, so broadcasting rights became a controversial issue. A promoter not on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> blacklist obtained the rights to the Leonard-Duran bout, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told the company not to relay it to the government station. The government station wanted to make a deal, but the promoters were afraid of upsetting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and being added to the list associated with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Spokesmen for the government station refused to say if it planned a delayed transmission. `` It is a pity, because this is a country with knowledgeable boxing fans,'' said sports promoter <PERSON> Edmundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>. However, the promotion company gave up its rights, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION>, dealt directly with a private television channel that will broadcast to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Colon, about 50 miles to the north. Last week, Panamanians also got around <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restrictions by sending a horse co-owned by a <LOCATION> Noriega </LOCATION> friend to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where it won the Caribbean Classic. `` There are no visa restrictions for horses,'' a foreign diplomat said. `` And although everybody here knows who owns the horse, apparently they sent it there as if it were owned by somebody else.'' Newspapers portrayed the victory of the Panamanian horse as a win over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Roman Catholic Assemblywoman <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> was narrowly elected to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because the church made a `` martyr'' out of the Democrat by denying her Communion for supporting abortion rights, her <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent said Wednesday. <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> disputed Assemblywoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>'s analysis of Tuesday's special election, saying her stance hurt her as much as it helped. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> proposed $ 98 million in spending cuts after voters Tuesday rejected three proposed tax increases, two of which had already gone into effect after approval by the Legislature. Five other referendums, including one requiring seat belt use and another mandating a statewide sex education curriculum, and a proposed constitutional amendment were also defeated. `` People were in the mood to vote ` no,' and once they started voting no, they just kept going,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Tish </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a four-year legal battle to boost Hispanic representation on <PERSON> Watsonsville </PERSON>'s city council ended with Hispanics losing three of four seats they'd sought under a new election system. Seven seats had been up for grabs. <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>'s margin over <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> election was razor thin. She got 61,860 ballots, or 50.97 percent of the vote, to 59,496 for <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, or 49.03. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, a freshman from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, said at a news conference that <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> `` had no choice'' but to deny Holy Communion to <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> three weeks ago, making her the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elected official to be so sanctioned. But, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> added, `` The bishop's action created an international celebrity and martyr.'' `` I do n't see that,'' <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> said at her post-election news conference. `` We got an awful lot of people who opposed me because of the bishop's decision. I think it worked both ways. ... I do n't think we'll ever know. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> reiterated his displeasure with <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>, saying he made an example of her because she had the responsibility as a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> elected official to follow church teachings in the public arena. `` It is to be noted that no popular vote or public opinion can change in any way the divine law that directs and guides humankind,'' <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> replaces an incumbent who resigned to become a municipal judge. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 253,439 people, or 53 percent of those eligible, cast ballots. The seven referendums were the most on a ballot since 1919. About 60 percent of the voters rejected proposed increases in income and motor fuel taxes, and a proposed raise in the sales tax lost 53 percent to 47 percent. `` I am very disappointed, obviously, in the outcome,'' Sinner said in proposing $ 34 million in cuts for elementary and secondary education, $ 24 million for higher education and $ 21 million for social services. Some attributed the defeat to years of drought and a decade of economic hardship. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> people are short of money and hurting,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told merchants to immediately lower the sales tax from 6 percent to 5 percent. State income taxes dropped from 17 percent to 14 percent of a federal tax bill. The gas-tax hike never took effect. In addition to the seat belt and sex education referendums, voters rejected proposals to legalize video gambling and put state lawmakers in the public employee retirement system. The defeated constitutional amendment would have limited the number of state agencies under the governor's control to 14. More than 100 now fall under gubernatorial jurisdiction. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>'s court-ordered election was the first under a district-vote system. Council candidates previously were elected at large. The election was originally scheduled for Nov. 7, but was postponed after the Oct. 17 earthquake, which demolished more than 300 homes in the farming community 95 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. One Hispanic candidate blamed her defeat on the disaster. `` We just did n't have the money, or whatever it took, to beat an earthquake,'' community organizer <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said at a glum post-election gathering. The only Hispanic to win a seat on the council was <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, the charismatic leader of a 19-month cannery strike.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> took a strong pro-choice stand on abortion here Tuesday, saying `` the early termination of pregnancy is a medical matter between the patient and the physician.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> voted to reaffirm the association's policy statement that abortion should be peformed only by a licensed physician in conformance with state laws, and that no physician should be required to perform an abortion in violation of good medical judgment or his or her personal moral principles The delegates then adopted, on a voice vote, the pro-choice amendment offered by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation. However, the `` no'' votes were nearly as strong as the affirmative votes. Delegates from some states argued that the amendment would run counter to positions taken by their state associations. The delegates also consdered a proposed policy statement on maternal-fetal conflict, but referred the matter to the Board of Trustees for further study before the the next annual meeting in June 1990. Physicians are wrangling with legal and moral issues arising when a pregnant woman refuses medical treatment that would benefit the health of her fetus. Also referred back to the trustees for further study was a proposed patient bill of rights, which stated that patients should have the right to basic and essential medical care.

 Rebel troops gave up their stronghold in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> business district Thursday and returned to their barracks, seven days after launching a coup attempt against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` This is unconditional surrender,'' said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> who led negotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders. `` The problem is already finished.'' However, rebels who marched the 1 \ miles back to nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION> were smiling, chanting `` No surrender, the fight goes on! Soldiers at the army base there unfurled a white sheet at the gate saying, `` Welcome Home.'' Rebels still held <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. However, local officials Thursday were trying to arrange talks there to end the occupation at the last known rebel stronghold. At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others wounded since the coup began Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who faced the gravest crisis of her 3 -LCB- - year-old administration, expressed relief that the siege was over `` I would also like to commend those who helped to bring about this end to urban terrorism,'' she said in a written statement. `` We must now all join hands and consolidate our resources to rebuild what has been destroyed.'' Thursday's announcement came one day after 1,800 foreigners, including about 250 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-held luxury hotels in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a national state of emergency. As the rebels left the skyscrapers and hotels, seized last Saturday, the atmosphere seemed more one of victory than defeat. The mutineers, rifles, bazookas, machine guns and bandoleers of ammunition slung over their shoulders, sang the theme song of their Scout Ranger unit as they marched to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION>. `` We have won some victories,'' said rebel Capt. <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>. `` We have made a very strong statement.'' As the mutineers marched past the exclusive <LOCATION> Forbes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> neighborhood, where <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> lives, some residents stood on the street and cheered. `` I would like to say that the soldiers are voluntarily returning to barracks,'' <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> told reporters as he left <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>. `` We did not surrender.'' Rebel spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON> said, `` We are willing to face the consequences of our acts, but the fight must go on.'' Scout ranger Cpl. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bantung </PERSON>, another mutineer, said: `` We will not surrender, even if it takes forever. The government must change. <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> must change her policies.'' He was using President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s nickname. The government agreed the rebels will be treated `` humanely, justly and fairly,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. But he added they would `` suffer the consequences'' for launching the sixth coup attempt against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she came to power in February 1986. He did not elaborate. Most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply been confined to barracks, and many enlisted men were sent back into the ranks. Some rebels have been charged but been acquitted or given light sentences. Rebels agreed about midnight to give up, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. `` We all agreed that if they returned to the barracks ... it would be good for the nation as a whole.'' He added that the rebels' political demands, which included the resignation of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, `` were non-negotiable.'' The rebels seized hotels and buildings in the financial area Saturday on the second day of their coup attempt. On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom jets flw air cover for loyalist forces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents from continuing air strikes from <LOCATION> Villamor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. They had seized the base in the first hours of the coup. Rebel leaders said the uprising was codenamed `` Seven Days and Seven Nights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stage operation. The leaders said the takeover of the financial district was the second stage. President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> early Wednesday evoked the `` people power'' revolution in appealing for support against mutinous soldiers bent on overthrowing her government. `` I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for democracy; I have lost my husband,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a nationally televised address, appearing tired. `` Why did I become president? It was because you believed in me, and in spite of all of the coup attempts, you have stuck by me'' against enemies who want `` to kill me ... so that they can rule our land,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was slain in 1983 as he arrived from self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. She took his place as the opposition presidential candidate and was swept into office by a popular uprising. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> went into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. After her speech Wednesday, the government announced that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had proclaimed a national state of emergency, giving her broad powers to cope with the rebellion launched Friday by thousands of soldiers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the evacuation was managed without incident, and `` all Americans were reported safe and we have no reports of injuries.'' After the evacuation, rebel and army representatives began talks on ending the rebellion. Sporadic sniping resumed, but the cease-fire generally held through the day. It was unclear what new powers Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would have. Cabinet officials insisted personal liberties would not be curtailed, but said special powers were needed to deal with the economic and social crisis caused by the coup. Public confidence has been shaken far more than by any of the five other coup attempts. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday two billion pesos -LRB- $ 91 million -RRB- had been withdrawn in runs on <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> banks the past two days and many parts of the archipelago had cash shortages because domestic air service had been suspended. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Drilon </PERSON> said: `` This is not martial law. There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will continue. We will continue to enjoy our rights. It only empowers government to check those who may not be delivering basic services.'' Rep. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Britannico </PERSON>, an opposition legislator, said the emergency declaration would discourage foreign investment and was `` a first step ... toward the declaration of martial law.'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON>, the government press secretary, said officials planned to take control of utilities and transport. <PERSON> Josephina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichaoco </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said new media guidelines would be issued. Among other things, she said, they would forbid the broadcast of `` rebellious terrorist propaganda'' comments and interviews, and `` strategic information'' such as troop movements, weapons and numbers of soldiers. In her television address, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> urged Filipinos to fill the streets Friday in the same demonstration of `` people power'' that forced the late President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into exile. `` It is very clear that these people want to kill me, to eliminate me, so that they can rule our land,'' she said. `` What they have forgotten is, power is not theirs to take. They can not just grab power by killing people. They have to understand, power belongs to you, my beloved countrymen.'' The rebels have demanded Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> resign in favor of a coalition that would hold a referendum on a new government. They accuse her of ignoring corruption, refusing to make social and economic reform and failing to crush the Communist insurgency that began a generation ago under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

 The glamour is fading from the computer industry at the close of the 1980s, tarnishing one of the most remarkable success stories of American business.

 <PERSON> Delta </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, whose weight gain has sent the rumor mill and the tabloid press into a frenzy, deals forthrightly with the issue in an episode of CBS' `` Designing Women'' on Monday. Her gain of about 30 pounds in the past two years has unleashed a fury of phony reports that she has been suspended from the show, that she's causing trouble on the set and that her six-month-old marriage to `` Major Dad'' star <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> is on the rocks. In Monday's episode, her character, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarbaker </PERSON>, has to face the fact that she's gotten fat when she is ridiculed at her high school reunion. `` When all this started I was very hurt,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. `` I did n't do anything to deserve this. Why are they so cruel? I went through a lot of emotions with this. You give yourself pep talks. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had to put up with this. Every star who's gained weight has had to put up with this.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who is 33 and 5-foot-5, declines to say what her weight is. `` It's nowhere near the 200 pounds they say it is,'' she said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was pilloried for getting fat. She finally went on a well-publicized diet and wrote a book about it. <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> went public with her diet on her talk show `` Oprah.'' <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> lost 67 pounds and vowed she would not gain it back because the tabloids would attack her if she did. She has put back on 17 pounds, however, and devoted another show to the gain. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> took off 35 pounds and is in a new hit movie, `` Look Who's Talking.'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> said in TV Guide that his 75-pound weight gain cost him $ 1 million in lost roles. He joined Overeaters Anonymous and got his weight down to a muscular 200 pounds. Some stars, nevertheless, seem unaffected after putting on a few pounds. <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> has a hit show on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and says she prefers being fat to being thin. Her co-star, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, does n't lack for choice roles in major movies. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> stars regularly in a hit series of `` Perry Mason'' movies on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> even stars in a CBS show called `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fat Man.'' <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> are all getting good roles. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> has not lost any roles, although the tabloids had stories that she was given ultimatums to lose weight or be kicked off `` Designing Women.'' `` Every story was a complete fabrication,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON>, creator and co-executive producer of the comedy series with her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>. `` It's like if you gain weight you have no right to live in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I wrote this episode because I want to kick the tabloids right in the teeth... `` It's embarrassing to me and all of us at ` Designing Women' that anyone would think we would fire someone for being overweight. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> is not only under attack in the press, but some radio disc jockeys regularly ridicule her. There's even a song that goes, `` <PERSON> Delta </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, how many pounds have you put on?'' `` It's just gotten to the point of a crisis,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said in an interview. `` There's been a lot of personal stuff about Mac and me. I'm not used to personal stuff. Then they began attacking my career. It's vicious. I've worked hard to build up a good reputation and they're trashing it. `` They said I chased <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> around the set. They said I was hiding in my dressing room. They said I was suspended for two weeks. They said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> gave me ultimatums to lose weight. First they attacked me, now they're attacking Mac. They said he was feeding me. That he said I was too fat. That we're having trouble. That he's kicking me out.'' A few days after the interview <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> describes as `` an old-fashioned romanticist,'' rented the ballroom at the Biltmore Hotel to celebrate their six-month anniversary. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said she retreated when the press reports first began. `` I backed off,'' she said. `` I did n't want to help them hurt me. I was also getting frustrated playing <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>. I wanted to show another side of her. I went to <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and talked to her about doing a show on the weight. She wrote this incredible script. Mac read it and cried.'' She got a standing ovation from the studio audience at the taping. `` Doing that show was like a cleansing for me,'' she said. `` Obviously I am overweight. That's the only thing the tabloids got right. It's hard to live your life when you're being scrutinized and not approved of. You have to change. You back away and you're not as trusting I just want to work and live my life.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a former Miss <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said people have been telling her she was fat since she was 16. `` I was n't overweight,'' she said. `` I was just curvy. I just did n't have the stick figure that's popular now. She said she has spent so much of her life taking diet pills and going on fad diets that it has `` messed up my metabolism.'' `` A quick diet is n't going to help my problem now,'' she said. `` You just gain the weight back. I take a self-defense class every Monday night and it's giving me more confidence and helping my self-esteem. What I'm doing is changing my lifestyle. But first I have to like me and accept me as I am. You ca n't be perfect in this life, but you can change and grow and strive to be better.''

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ The moment is imbedded in the nation's memory: a handicapped, young man playing the guitar with his feet and singing for Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and millions watching on television. `` The day is filled with love,'' sang <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on that September 1987 day. `` Today is like no other day before. And you and I will never be the same.'' Suddenly, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> startled his phalanx of security guards and climbed over barricades to embrace <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> and bless with a kiss the musical talents of the crying man who was once turned away from the priesthood because he lacked arms with which to celebrate the Eucharist. `` You are giving hope to all of us. My wish to you is to continue giving this hope to all the people,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. The kiss made <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> an instant celebrity, and he went from an itinerant musician who played for spare change on the streets of beach towns in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to a sought-after concert artist and the author of a new book, `` A Gift of Hope'' written with <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` I think the Lord has something, a mission for myself. I'm not sure if it's just to give hope to people, like the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, to make music, or maybe just to tell people you can do it: If <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> can do it, you can do as much, maybe more,'' <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said. In an interview from his home in <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the 27-year-old <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said his ministry is `` very subtle. `` There is no waving of Bibles, no altar calls. Just a guy with a guitar _ sharing his life.'' White, his co-author, said sucess has not affected <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON>. `` I've written 23 books, most of them about celebrities and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> is just the opposite,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` He's not heroic. He's just a simple guy who does n't want anything to change.'' He was born in a town in southwestern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. His mother, confusing her pregnancy with the flu, had taken a prescribed capsule of thalidomide, later found to cause birth defects. To obtain medical care, his family emigrated in 1963 to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> applied at the end of his junior year in high school to become a priest. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> turned him down. Without a thumb and forefinger to serve the Eucharist, he was told, he could not be a priest. But <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said his interest in ministry never wavered. `` More than just becoming a priest, I wanted to somehow minister. Any kind of ministry I wanted to do.'' He played guitar regularly at Mass at two churches, and was invited to audition to play before the pope. Still, up to three weeks before his Sept. 15 date with the pope, <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> played with an open guitar case seeking change from passers-by on the boardwalk at <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He recalls in his book that the moment the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> embraced him, a voice inside him said, `` Yes, it was for this that I was born. It was for this that I came into the world.'' He now travels the world in concert tours, has sung at a World Series and the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, has one album out and another planned for January, and a television movie on his life is being developed. `` I really feel the Lord sending me places that maybe even priests or nuns can not go,'' <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said. A celebrity in his own right, he is able to share special moments with others, especially those who can empathize with his physical condition. At one concert, a women who could not hear, speak or talk put her hand on his guitar and started strumming her belly in time to the music. `` I'll never forget that. It was so moving,'' <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said. In his book, <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> tells of going back for a concert at the Universal Amphitheater _ the scene of his triumph with the pope _ and encountering a badly deformed young woman in a wheelchair. He said her eyes filled with tears as she struggled to tell him, `` <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, because of you, we all have hope.'' <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said he did not know what to say. `` I wanted to hold her in my absent arms and let my tears mingle with hers. Instead, armless, I thanked her and walked away.''

<HEAD>Fund Success Formula: Growth Plus Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As they plan their strategies for the 1990s, mutual-fund investors might well find themselves in a quandary. Should they place their bets on aggressive stock funds, hoping that the next decade will keep up the bull-market dramatics of the'80s? Or should they take a more defensive approach, reasoning that less ebullient times lie ahead? For the ordinary mortal not equipped with the power to foresee the future, advisers say a compromise could be in order _ a fund that pursues the dual objectives of growth and income. Funds in this category invest heavily in the stock market. But they generally shy away from shooting for big winners in speculative, high-risk issues. Rather, they tend to focus on established blue chips and other staid stocks whose size and record suggests they are unlikely to experience a sudden nosedive. In addition, many of those stocks offer more generous dividend yields than can be found in younger companies, which keep most or all of the money they make to plow back into the business for growth. A healthy dividend yield theoretically provides support should the stock market in general run into a prolonged period of weakness. Sounds pretty good, does n't it? One brokerage house goes so far in its current promotional literature as to bill growth-and-income funds `` the best of both worlds.'' `` Looking for long-term growth of capital AND income, without excessive price volatility?'' it says. `` Growth and income funds may be for you.'' The skeptical reader might detect a whiff of exaggeration in any claim of that sort. Normally, to get high dividend income, you have to accept relatively modest prospects for capital gains, or vice versa. As in any compromise, in other words, you expect to give up something to get something in return. Lately, however, growth and income funds have been defying that time-honored logic. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors the performance of more than 900 mutual funds, growth and income funds averaged a total return _ capital gains plus dividends _ of 125 percent from the end of 1983 through the third quarter of 1989. That surpassed the 109.1 percent gain posted by long-term growth funds; 98.2 percent for funds seeking maximum capital gains, and 97.3 percent investing in stocks mainly for income. Since they occurred over a span of nearly six years, it's hard to dismiss these results as a temporary aberration. Managers of the best growth and income funds must have been doing something right. Also, analysts say, they had help from market conditions. In the latter half of the 1980s, there has been an extended vogue for the kind of big-name stocks that growth and income funds like to own. Price indexes of utility stocks, another favorite holding, recently have hit new highs. Perhaps most important of all, these funds have thrived on a combination of rising stock prices and falling interest rates _ trends that have not always coincided in the past. Can they keep it up in the new decade? Most observers agree the answer depends in large measure on whether investment fashions change. From the mid-1970s until the summer of 1983, the atmosphere favored low-dividend, rapid growth stocks. Sales of mutual funds specializing in that sector of the market soared just as they were approaching their peak. Were stocks to fall and interest rates rise in some future period, growth and income funds could find themselves hit with a double whammy. But for now, at least, they can boast that they have allowed `` singles-hitter'' investors to outscore their counterparts who swing for the fences.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration began looking for a successor to savings and loan regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> while the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said hearings that led to <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s resignation were `` just the beginning'' of the investigation. The administration wants a professional regulator to head the Office of Thrift Supervision, rather than an appointee whose chief qualifications are political connections, according to an industry source, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity. Wall announced his resignation Monday.

<HEAD>International Banks Commit Funds to Mexican Package</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s commercial bank creditors have committed about 90 percent of a financing package for 1989-1992 covering about $ 48 billion of Mexican medium - and long-term debt, according to an official announcement The remaining commitments are expected by the end of this week, Mexican finance undersecretary <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON> and bank representative <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said in a joint communique Tuesday. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> is co-chairman of a 15-member bank committee that reached a preliminary agreement with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last July and recommended its approval to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s approximately 400 creditor banks. To date, 345 banks have committed to the package, the communique said. Only two banks, with small exposure, have so far declined to participate. `` We are getting positive responses from some banks that have n't participated in the process for a number of years,'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said Banks' commitments to the three options in the package are following the pattern anticipated by <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> at a press conference Nov. 14. New money is running between 8 percent and 10 percent of the total committed. The remainder is split about evenly between repackaged debt in which either the principal or interest has been reduced, the announcement said. The communique said the signing of the agreements is expected to start before the end of December, assuming continuing rapid progress in completing the complex legal documentation. The package covers nearly half of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s total $ 107 billion foreign debt, second in the developing world to the $ 120 billion owed by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The package represents the first significant reduction in a Third World government's debt to international commercial banks. It is considered an important step in the Third World debt crisis that began seven years ago when <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> announced in August 1982 it was unable to meet obligations. Since then Third World debt has grown to about $ 1.3 trillion. The agreement has also been seen as a test of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policy for reducing Third World debt and as a milestone for other countries waiting to renegotiate. Under the agreement the creditor banks have three options: a 35 percent reduction in principal, reduction of the interest rate on loans to 6.25 percent from around 10 percent previously, or providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes the bank.

<TEXT>
 A subscription television network that will carry training and information programs for investment professionals is scheduled to debut in January, the developers of the service announced. The Financial Satellite Network is being marketed to stockbrokers, bankers, insurance agents and financial planners, and 22 clients with about 240 offices have already signed up, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Drossos </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of the parent company of the network, <ORGANIZATION> Drossos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Starting Jan. 2, he said, the network will carry four hours of programs that will be delivered every business day via satellite to subscribers. The subscription cost is $ 545 a month per site. The network operators will provide a satellite dish for each site and connect the dish to all of the televisions in each office. There will be no advertising on the network. <PERSON> Drossos </PERSON> said Tuesday the service is designed to keep brokers and other financial professionals abreast of the latest market trends and enhance their sales skills without having to leave the office for seminars. The network will offer 15 rotating series of programs on topics such as financial planning techniques, legal issues facing brokers and telemarketing techniques as well as interviews with market movers, discussions of the latest financial instruments and trading strategies and motivational lectures. The material will be produced by the company, <PERSON> Drossos </PERSON> said.

 Along with East European freedom seekers, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall is attracting American admakers. In the month since the historic opening of the border between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, admakers for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the fragrance marketer Quintessence have filmed commercials at the wall. They said their ads, which will be running through ther holiday season, are designed to celebrate the exhilaration and emotion of newly won freedom. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, the soft drink arm of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday its commercial features a documentary-style montage of people approaching the wall about 10 days after the border was opened in early November. Its admakers tried to `` blend in with the news crews that were there'' to capture genuine, unscripted moments that exemplified the joys of freedom, said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>. In the 30-second commercial that was scheduled to debut next Tuesday night and run repeatedly on network television through Jan. 1, <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said a young woman is shown handing a flower to a border guard and a group of young children use small hammers to chip at the wall. No actors were used in the ad. `` In this season of giving, the gift of freedom is the greatest gift of all,'' a narrator says. The <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> name appears at the end of the spot but it makes no specific product pitch. Admakers for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T interviewed people at the wall and near the border crossing points in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in which they recalled what they did when the border was opened and how it made them feel. A number of those interviewed told how they called friends and relatives with the news. Those interviews will be intercut with interviews being shot now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of people who have relatives in East or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. One-minute and 30-second versions of the ad will be made for use on television starting Dec. 17, according to the admakers. `` The idea was that we can help people share their thoughts and feelings,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, division manager of advertising for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in <LOCATION> Basking </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The Quintessence ad tells the story about an elderly East German man crossing the border into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, evidently to be reunited with his family and a grandson he may have never seen. As the man passes through a checkpoint, his grandson runs toward him and they embrace. An East German border guard picks up a teddy bear that the older man dropped and hands it to the youngster. The commercial was designed to acquaint people with the name of the privately-held fragrance company, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION>, whose brands include <PERSON> Jovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Musk </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Adidas </ORGANIZATION> for Men, according to President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aramanda </PERSON>. `` It is a holiday message that says peace on earth,'' he said. The commercial, filmed in late November in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, debuts Dec. 12 on network television during a broadcast of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Beauty & amp; The Beast.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zast </PERSON>, senior vice president for marketing at the Chicago-based Quintessence, said the ad included five West Germans and 18 East Germans, who were offered the equivalent of $ 55 to appear in the ad _ the same as East Germans were getting as a welcoming gift from the West German government upon arriving in that nation in the first days after the border was opened. `` Crowd control was something of a problem,'' <PERSON> Zast </PERSON> said. But he said the admakers were `` blessed with a snowstorm'' the morning they started shooting the ad _ a fitting start to a holiday commercial. In another move marking changing <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> this week is airing a slightly altered version of its `` General Assembly'' commercial for Coca-Cola Classic, which features more than 1,000 young people from many nations singing a song in 16 languages. The song's message, `` Promise us tomorrow, and we'll build a better world for you,'' marked the 1987 <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> Summit between former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The version airing this week carries these words on the screen at the end: `` Today, as barriers between people come down, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> celebrates the hope of a better tomorrow.''

 Defense lawyers in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation trial have introduced newly obtained telephone records that appear to contradict pivotal government testimony about calls discussing the alleged fraud. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> called the records, which previously were thought to be nonexistent, `` obviously very crucial, extraordinary.'' The new evidence indicates no calls were placed on long-distance WATS lines from the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage to <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> or its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, during times in October 1986 when the government alleges the manipulation was discussed. The defense rested its case Tuesday after actress <PERSON> Liv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> testified on <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>'s behalf as the final witness in the seven-week criminal trial in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> are charged with allegedly trying to boost <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s share price in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of the stock after a failed takeover bid. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. The case is in its third trial after two mistrials earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> trading director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> has testified he called <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> between 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Oct. 29, 30 and 31 in 1986 _ shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed _ to discuss actions taken those days to close the stock above $ 22 a share, as allegedly ordered by <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. Other calls to <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> to discuss the scheme allegedly were made while he was at his doctor's office and at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> records introduced Monday indicate that no calls were made during the half hour in question on any of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 WATS lines to <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> or Sherwin or to the other offices. <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said the records contradicted testimony by <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and his trading assistant, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> called <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> `` within moments'' of the market's close. Defense lawyers said privately they believe the new information shows that the calls to <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> never were made. No records of the calls appeared on <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s regular long-distance telephone bills either. The defense called an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T supervisor who retrieved the records and a private investigator who analyzed them on the witness stand. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did not attempt to rebut the testimony. The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize profits after a failed takeover attempt by <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> of much larger Union Carbide. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a specialty chemicals company, held 10 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> after the failed bid and sold 5 million in November 1986 for $ 23 a share. <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> testified she has known <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> 10 years through work on a refugee settlement organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> is a vice president of the group and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> is chairman of its executive committee. `` I would say he is, from my heart, the most honorable, moral man I have ever met,'' the Norwegian film star said under questioning from <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>, who has appeared in such films as director <PERSON> Ingemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s `` Cries and Whispers'' and `` Scenes From a Marriage,'' testified for about 10 minutes about her career, extensive human rights work and association with <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. Afterward, she talked briefly with <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> and kissed him on the cheek before leaving the courthouse. Closing arguments in the trial were expected to last two days and the case could go to the jury for deliberations Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has little to say about a lawsuit that claims the company artificially depressed its stock price last month by not quickly disclosing a Japanese patent potentially worth billions of dollars. The class-action suit filed in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> federal court Monday claimed the company misrepresented its financial prospects by not disclosing that it had been granted the patent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the basic computer chip. Industry analysts estimate that the patent, which was issued Oct. 30, could generate $ 100 million to $ 300 million in annual royalties from Japanese companies until it expires in November 2001. The lawsuit alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> knew about the Japanese patent ruling as early as August and that the company should have mentioned it in a third-quarter earnings report released Oct. 20. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> did not inform investors about the patent until after a Japanese business newspaper reported the story Nov. 21. Because investors were not told of the prospects for the Japanese patent, the earnings report contained `` misrepresentations'' about <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>' prospects of increased revenues from royalties, according to the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> said Monday that the company `` is confident that it has fully complied with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disclosure requirements.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> declined further comment. On Nov. 20, the day before the Japanese patent became public knowledge, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to take a $ 55 million write-down in fourth-quarter earnings and to lay off up to 1,500 domestic employees. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 29 a share on Nov. 20 but rose to $ 36 by the close of trading Nov. 22, following the patent announcement. The suit was brought by an investor, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Broza </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who had purchased five options to sell <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> stock in November. She claims to represent all investors who sold <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> stock or bought options on <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> stock between Oct. 20 and Nov. 22. More than 14 million <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> shares were traded by thousands of investors during the period. The suit seeks compensatory damages resulting from the trading of undervalued stock. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Junkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a TI executive vice president; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Toomay </PERSON>, a TI director, also were named as defendants. <PERSON> George </PERSON> purchased 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> shares at $ 30 each on Nov. 9 and <PERSON> Toomay </PERSON> purchased 500 shares at $ 31.50 apiece on Oct. 30.

<HEAD>Strategy Down Sharply in Early November After Backlash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Program trading activity dropped sharply in the first two weeks of November after a backlash against the controversial strategy, which is blamed by some for causing market turmoil. New York Stock Exchange figures released Tuesday showed a steep decline in index arbitrage, the main form of computerized program trading, reflecting an exodus by large brokerages from the strategy after it came under fire following the sharp stock market drop of Oct. 13. Index arbitrage accounted for 38.7 percent of program trades from Nov. 6-10 and 25.7 percent from Nov. 13-17, down from 53.8 percent in all of October, the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its first weekly reports on program trading. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> is releasing the data as part of a series of moves to control stock market volatility implemented after the sudden 190-point market decline on Friday the 13th and an 80-point rise Oct. 24. The new figures also indicated a large jump in program trading compared with the rest of the week during a sharp intraday decline on Nov. 6, when the Dow Jones industrials average fell 30 points from the previous day's close at 11:15 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said program trading accounted for 13.6 percent, or 1.94 million shares, of 14.3 million shares traded from 11 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.. As part of its weekly report, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> said it will profile program trading activity for half-hour periods when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> drops 30 points from the previous day's close or moves 30 points in a single direction Since the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> does not break down program trading daily, it is not possible to determine whether the amount of program trading in the half-hour period on Nov. 6 exceeded program trading the rest of the day. Overall in the first weekly report, program trading strategies accounted for 6.7 million of an average daily <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume of 148.8 million shares, or 4.5 percent. Buy programs totaled 3.0 million shares and sell programs 3.7 million, the exchange said. For the second week, the trading totaled 7.9 percent of an average daily volume of 147.7 million shares, or 11.6 million shares a day. Buy programs accounted for 7.7 million shares and sell programs for 3.9 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> defines program trading as any order for the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks. Index arbitrage involves rapid trading of stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to profit from momentary price discrepancies between the two markets. Critics say index arbitrage exaggerates market movements, triggering waves of selling and sometimes buying. Defenders say the strategy helps stabilize trading by linking the two markets, pulling prices closer together. The new NYSE figures showed a drop in program trading from October, when the strategies accounted for 9.7 percent of daily <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume of 182.4 million shares, or 17.7 million shares a day. The exchange began compiling program trading volume on a monthly basis in August 1988. The lowest monthly total to date was 7.6 percent last April. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which ceased index arbitrage for its own account but continues it for customers, was the leader in the trading, with 10.9 million shares for Nov. 6-10 and 23.2 million shares Nov. 13-17. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was a distant second with 4.9 million shares traded the first week and 4.5 million the second.

<HEAD>Sales Slump Continues; One Analysts Blames New Models</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 9.3 percent decline in late-November sales of North American-made cars and light trucks continues a downward trend that one analyst says reflects boredom among consumers over the new model lineup. The eight major automakers with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants reported Tuesday they sold vehicle at an average daily rate of 37,059 during Nov. 21-30, compared with 40,843 a day on average during the same time last year. Car sales were down 12.5 percent and light truck sales were off 3.8 percent. The slump during the 10-day period continues a decline that began in early October, just as the 1990 model year got under way. `` There's not a lot of excitement left in the industry,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinaitis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Everybody's got sort of the same cars.'' <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which make up more than three-quarters of the North American-produced auto market, reported their combined car and truck sales fell 14 percent during the period this year compared with last year. For the month of November, with imported cars and trucks counted in, vehicle sales fell 11.9 percent, with car sales dropping 13.5 percent and light truck sales off 8.5 percent. Through the first 11 months of this year, domestic and import car and truck sales were running 4.5 percent behind last year's pace, with car sales down 5 percent and light truck sales off 3.2 percent <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said sales of its North American-built cars fell 24 percent and light truck sales declined 15.1 percent. `` Since about the first of October, we've had less traffic,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON>, general sales manager of <LOCATION> Celozzi-Ettleson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chevrolet-Geo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Elmhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The last quarter has taken quite a bite out of us.'' Last summer, automakers were faced with swollen new-car inventories, prompting them to lay on incentive packages to move the vehicles out of showrooms. The incentives, coupled with news of pending price increases when the 1990 models began rolling into dealer lots in early October, forced some people to buy 1989 models rather than 1990s. That resulted in some fourth-quarter sales being stolen by the third quarter. `` What we're seeing now, however, is more than payback for the pull-ahead,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sales Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON>. `` Some prospective buyers are deferring purchases due to uncertainty about the economic outlook. `` More than anything else, that uncertainty is fueled by high interest rates.'' <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON> said he expected the 1990 sales slump to end in a month or two, mainly because he sees no long-term economic downturn. `` As far as the economy goes, everything is stable,'' he said. `` There's nothing drastic that's going to happen.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s combined domestic car and truck sales were down 21.1 percent in late November this year compared with last year. For the entire year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car and truck sales were down 5.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its late-November vehicle sales were 6.1 percent behind last year's pace, as car sales dropped 8.7 percent and light truck sales fell 2.6 percent. Through November of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car and truck sales were running 2.6 percent lower than during the first 11 months of last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its late-November car sales fell 15.7 percent but its truck sales during the period rose 1.6 percent, combining for a 7 percent decrease. Year-to-date sales of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars and light trucks were running 6.4 percent below last year's pace.

<HEAD>Stocks Hit Another Record High, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed at a record high today for the 10th time in the last 11 trading days, while the dollar rose marginally against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 160.12 points, or 0.43 percent, closing at 37,654.29. It had gained 190.30 points on Tuesday in its current record-setting run, which paused only Friday. Today, the index dipped in early trading on selling to take profits, but <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Kazuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said investors' buying incentives were much stronger than their concerns over the rapid increase in share prices. `` It seems the index just could not stop rising,'' he said, adding that it probably will reach 38,000 by the year's end. On the first section, an estimated 1.2 billion shares changed hands, down from Tuesday's 1.3 billion. Among gainers were electrical, housing and chemical shares. In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.75 yen, up 0.07 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.68 yen. It opened at 143.72 yen and stayed in a narrow range between 143.65 yen and 143.76 yen. The dollar now has climbed 0.85 yen in the last four days. `` The range is just getting narrower and narrower,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Yoshitsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON> said, attributing this to a lack of fresh market-affecting news. Spot trading totaled $ 3.1 billion, down from Tuesday's $ 4.1 billion. The dollar also moved little against the West German mark despite traders' expectations that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency would weaken against the mark, <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON> said. `` It did n't work that way here because Japanese investors still have strong demand for the dollar,'' he said. He added that recent currency rates were influenced more by investors' supply and demand, rather than economic trends. Thus Friday's announcement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for November will have little impact on the market, he said.

 The dollar was little changed in trendless European trading early today. Gold prices fell. Dealers said the dollar was trading within a narrow range as traders moved to the sidelines to await further signs of the health of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for November due to be released Friday could provide a fresh view of the economy and shed light on the future policies of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar edged up 0.07 Japanese yen to a closing 143.75 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it inched up further to 143.77 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.7767 West German marks, down from 1.7790; 1.5927 Swiss francs, up from 1.5910; 6.0652 French francs, down from 6.0675; 2.0034 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0100; 1,308.25 Italian lire, up from 1,307.00; and 1.1622 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1640 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.5742 from $ 1.5715 late Tuesday.

 Fast food is serious stuff to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> Distinguished Professor at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. There are no easy A's in Burger Flipping 101 here. `` We are a business school,'' says <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who holds what is believed to be the first university endowment paid for by a fast-food chain. In his classes, students study market research and motivational training, not milkshake theory or the physics of french fries. Fast food is big business, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, with $ 60 billion in annual sales. And that is of more than academic interest to his students. `` The number one thing that drives a student in our college is career,'' he said. `` That may not be what academics like ... but our kids come here so they can get out of here and improve their state of living.'' Graduates of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s program leave with five or six career offers, he said, with salaries starting at $ 20,000 a year and rising to more than $ 30,000 after three years. Of this year's 90 graduates from the university's hotel and restaurant administration program, 18 entered the fast-service industry. One such former student is <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> district manager in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who says he makes `` damn good money'' and drives a Corvette, thinks more colleges should offer career training for the fast-service industry. `` There's a lot of engineers coming out of colleges, but at two years out of college I was making more than an engineer,'' said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who supervises 120 employees at five restaurants that do a combined $ 4 million worth of business annually. `` Where is a 24-year-old going to get that kind of chance?'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked. `` Fast food.'' <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> a $ 250,000 endowment this year _ matched by a state grant _ to increase the number of trained professionals in the industry and conduct academic research. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 60, was chosen last month after the university advertised the post nationally and reviewed about 40 applicants. He has a master's degree in education from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> and has been teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s hotel and restaurant school since 1986. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> knows the fast-food business from bitter experience. His attempt to open a taco restaurant in the 1960s was less than a rousing success. `` I did n't know the farmers in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, did n't like tacos,'' he recalled with a laugh. He went on to a successful 13 years as managing partner of a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> restaurant, <PERSON> Chateau </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, and then became director of new ventures for <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, served as president of the Shakey's Pizza chain and moved on to become director of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, Restaurant and Institutional Management at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He approaches every task with the energy and enthusiasm that made him a successful high school football coach in the 1950s. Some of the management skills he teaches students come straight from the locker room. Successful fast-food managers must give their teen-age employees self-confidence, just as a coach must do, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` When you can enhance a teen-ager's self-esteem, they'll kill themselves for you,'' he said. `` And by the way, money ranks fourth in what motivates them.'' While the workforce is young, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the average age of fast-service customers is rising. `` The customer is what counts, that middle-class American who is time-poor, does n't want to spend money for tipping, but wants good quality food,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s students do n't learn cooking skills at school; their courses focus more on managerial topics such as market research, which he believes is a key to success in the restaurant business. `` Fast-fooders are consumer research-focused,'' he said. `` McDonald's, <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, Pizza Hut _ they know more about where their customer's head is and where it is going, and they're building their menus to suit those customers. `` We've had a lot of skeptics about fast service, but you know, what it amounts to is real simple _ the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public does n't listen, they vote with their pocketbooks And fast food has grown faster and continues to grow twice as fast as the entire industry.''

<HEAD>Canadian Pacific Intends to Spin Off Unit, Adopts Poison Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said it intends to spin off its real estate portfolio valued at more than $ 3 billion and has adopted an anti-takeover defense. President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said Tuesday that the company knew of no takeover threats but decided to adopt a `` poison pill'' as a pre-emptive measure. Rumors circulated last summer about an impending takeover of the Montreal-based conglomerate which has interests in numerous aspects of the Canadian economy including transportation, energy, forest products, telecommunications and real estate. Analysts say Canadian Pacific would be rich pickings for a raider with an eye on dismantling it. Possible buyers mentioned in rumors were the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmarais </PERSON>, president of cash-rich <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Canadian Pacific plans to spin off its <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, turning it into a publicly traded company Eighty percent of Marathon will be distributed to Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and the remaining 20 percent will be retained by <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which will help Marathon in developing the potential of its property holdings. The distribution was approved in principle by <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Tuesday The plan will be implemented once it is approved by shareholders and after certain other conditions are met. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said the book value of Marathon's assets is about 2.1 Canadian dollars but internal estimates indicate its current market value exceeds 4 billion Canadian dollars, or about $ 3.43 billion. Meanwhile, the company also announced Tuesday that `` upon the occurrence of certain triggering events'' stockholders will have the right to acquire shares at 50 per cent of market value _ a move that would significantly dilute stock value. The events include acquisition of 10 per cent or more of ordinary shares, or of ordinary and preferred shares, by a buyer who does n't have approval from the board of directors. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said the aim of the plan is to ensure shareholders get the most for their stock under any takeover. <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>, at a gathering of financial analysts in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, emphasized the posion pill is a pre-emptive measure and he is not aware of `` any pending or threatened takeover bids for the company. `` I do n't know of any action in the stock that would suggest an impending takeover. It's been quiet of late,'' he said. Poison pills, used for the first time in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Inco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> last fall but widely prevalent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are aimed at discouraging hostile takeovers by burdening a company with debt or triggering a dilution of stock. Canadian Pacific's poison pill must be approved at the company's annual meeting next May Canadian Pacific shares closed on the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday at 25.12 Canadian dollars, down 12 cents.

 The stock market was mixed in relatively subdued early trading today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 2.35 points to 2,739.33 at 10 a.m. EST, a half-hour after the opening.

However, nearly 20 percent of the respondents said a recession will occur either by the end of the year or during the first three months of 1990, ending an unprecedented peacetime economic expansion that began its eighth year this month. The new report was considerably more optimistic than last May's survey, which found 63 percent of the economists expecting a recession next year Three months later, 37 percent of the economists still forecast recession in 1990. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the last time the <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> survey correctly forecast a recession was in 1980, when it predicted the 1981-82 economic downturn. But he added that since 1983, the economists have been within one percentage point of forecasting the following year's gross national product In the November survey, the consensus among the 59 respondents was that the gross national product _ the nation's total output of goods and services _ would continue to grow slowly, dropping from the 2.9 percent forecast for 1989 to 1.8 percent next year. The survey also showed an easing of inflation fears, with predictions that the consumer price index will fall from 4.8 percent forecast for 1989 to 4.2 percent next year. At the same time, the economists expect interest rates would continue to fall, with rates on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills dropping from 8.1 percent in 1989 to 7.1 percent in 1990. For 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, the expected estimate is 7.8 percent next year, compared with 8.4 percent this year. The economy has slowed considerably this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted interest rates to restrain rising prices. But it began in June to gradually let rates fall as inflationary pressures moderated. The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> actions, and the economists forecast continued weakness in industrial production. But their report said `` the slower overall growth and weaker industrial production is not expected to be reflected in higher unemployment.'' The survey suggested unemployment would rise only from 5.3 percent this year to 5.5 percent next year. That was down from the 5.8 percent predicted in their May survey and 5.7 percent in August. The housing industry, hurt by higher interest rates earlier this year, is expected to improve modestly, with housing starts rising from 1.4 million in 1989 to 1.45 million in 1990, the economists said. But they foresee no relief for the automobile industry, a third sector in the economic doldrums. Car and small truck sales, they said, would drop from 15.1 million this year to 14.7 million in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> report also suggested changes in the expected composition of the GNP in 1990. `` Consumer demand is expected to constitute a significantly larger share of growth while investment, reflecting a deteriorating outlook for corporate profits, is expected to weaken,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> also said its forecasters predicted the nation's twin deficits in merchandise trade and the federal budget would narrow, but `` only very slowly.'' `` For 1990, the trade imbalance should be about $ 100 billion -LRB- down from $ 109 billion in 1989 -RRB- and federal spending will exceed revenue by $ 141 billion -LRB- after a reported $ 152 billion in fiscal 1989 -RRB-,'' it said.

<HEAD>Banks Lost $744 Million in Third Quarter This Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's commercial banks lost $ 744 million in the third quarter this year, the first loss in more than two years, the government said today. The bulk of the red ink was concentrated in several large banks that set aside new reserves for expected losses on loans to Third World nations, as well as in rising real estate loan problems in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also said the insurance fund protecting deposits at 12,824 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks likely will record the second loss in its history this year. The fund declined by about $ 4 billion in 1988 and will shrink by an additional $ 250 million to $ 500 million this year, he said. Bank failures, totaling 192 so far this year, likely will approach but not exceed last year's record of 211, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Based on a fall in the number of problem banks from 1,394 at the start of 1989 to 1,134 at the end of September, he predicted the failure rate would decline next year. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said banks should approach commercial and development real estate lending more cautiously. Although bank profits overall likely will bounce back in the final three months of 1989, the number of sour real estate loans will continue to rise, he predicted. `` I do n't want to Scrooge up Christmas ... but I'm afraid the fourth quarter will show a continuation of the -LRB- real estate -RRB- trends we see here,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. The loss in the July-September period compares with profits of $ 7 billion in the second quarter and $ 7.3 billion in the first quarter. Last year banks earned a record profit of $ 25.2 billion. Commercial banks last recorded a loss in the second quarter of 1987. Red ink totaled $ 10.6 billion and was attributed to losses on developing country lending. Some of the nation's largest banks again took writedowns in the third quarter on their loans to developing countries. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> increased its loss reserves by $ 2 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by $ 1.3 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by $ 950 million. Analysts attributed the writedowns to banks' recognition that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s debt strategy will require them to accept more losses. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s plan, launched in March, emphasizes debt reduction as well as new lending to developing countries. However, critics of the plan worry that banks will be reluctant to make new loans after recognizing big losses. Commercial real estate lending problems, common in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> since the mid-1980s, are spreading elsewhere. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warned that involvement in real estate lending makes large banks vulnerable to rising interest rates or a recession In a speech Tuesday, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> called real estate lending is `` an emerging area of concern'' and said his agency was studying real estate markets nationwide. `` Over the last 12 months, real estate loan growth has accounted for nearly two-thirds of all bank asset growth, and now comprises almost one-fourth of all commercial bank assets,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sour loans nationally, he said. In the Northeast, the percentage of delinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year, he said.

<HEAD>Corn and Wheat Prices Grain on Expectation of Increased Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and futures were higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat prices climbed as traders reacted to news that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has targeted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 1 million metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program. Prices also were expected to get a boost from continued dry conditions in the winter wheat crop area. Follow-through buying by commercial houses gave corn prices some support, said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Martyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said traders also were encouraged by optimistic pronouncements by negotiators attending the U.S.-Soviet grain talks Despite opening higher, analysts say soybeans looked weak because of a lack of export business, and news that Argentine farmers are enjoying adequate soil moisture and are moving ahead with soybean planting. In early trading, wheat was 1 \ cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were \ cent to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.44 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 5.76 Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Light beef demand at the retail level was a drag on cattle futures, as were lower cash prices. Hog futures were pressured by mixed pork product prices, although support came from an announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> has accepted offers in its latest weekly tender for 1.48 million pounds of bellies. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .18 cent higher with December at 75.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with January at 82.75 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .15 cent lower with December at 51.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .45 cent higher with February at 55.45 cents a pound. Livestock futures settled higher and pork futures were mixed in Tuesday's trading.

Price said <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> has shown `` the kind of exceptional strategic vision and managerial prowess that was essential in helping to turn this company around ... and I have every confidence that he is the right man to lead <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> forward.'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> was named president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> in December 1988. Previously, he had been president of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s disk drive operation. In that capacity, he transformed what was an ailing division into a profitable operation, Price said. In October, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> credited extensive restructuring for third-quarter earnings of $ 9.8 million, compared with a $ 2.4 million earnings loss in the same 1988 period. For the first nine months of this year, the company reported a loss of $ 484 million, compared with earnings of $ 14.5 million for the 1988 period. A $ 497 million loss in the second quarter of this year was forecast by the company in April when it shut down the <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer subsidiary and cut 3,100 jobs. Closing the St. Paul-based <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> cost <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> around $ 335 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was temporarily shutting down some Canadian assembly and component plants in early January because of soft vehicle demand mostly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 17,700 workers would be affected, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said by telephone the company's two car assembly plants in <LOCATION> Oshawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and its full-size van plant in <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, would be closed for the week of Jan. 2 He also said the Ste. <PERSON> Therese </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, car assembly plant would be closed for two weeks beginning at the same time. Two component plants will be shut down briefly this month. `` It's just a softening in the market,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` Seventy-five -LRB- percent -RRB- to 80 percent of what we make goes to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and light truck sales have taken a nosedive since Oct. 1.

 Merger negotiations have nearly collapsed between the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> automaker and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, and both companies are seeking other possible partners. French Industry Minister <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauroux </PERSON> disclosed the stalled negotiations Tuesday, leaving the two automakers vulnerable in the face of intensifying competition in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` No one should expect a large-scale operation or a global linkup in the coming weeks,'' he told a news conference. `` That would be an illusion.'' The companies have been talking for several months on collaboration that might eventually have led to a full merger of their car and truck building activities.

 Employees in <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area office were pressured by their supervisors in the late 1970s and early 1980s to obtain secret budget documents from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a federal court jury was told today. Retired <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> testified that among those he received documents from was former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who is on trial on charges of illegally obtaining budget documents from the Pentagon. <PERSON> Folwer </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to 39 counts, including conspiracy, illegal conveyance of classfied documents and mail fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and has agreed to pay a $ 5.2 million fine. <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> said he was asked by his supervisor to get classified <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> budget documents and turned to <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, an old friend, for help. `` Honeywell worked on a management-by-objective system,'' <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> said of his Minneapolis-based employer. <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> said one of his objectives was to `` establish meaningful contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' and that meant getting classified documents containing budget information the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> used to plan its spending. Such material could help defense contractors, such as <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, in bidding for defense projects by giving them inside information on what the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would want. <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> said he got documents from <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> five or 10 times a year, from 1979 to early 1984. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> often passed him documents on the street outside <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, office, <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> said, adding that he copied the documents and returned the originals to <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, a senior security administrator for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, testified that in the early 1980s, she was ordered to keep a separate log of classified documents that <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> and others brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> office. The log was kept in a separate case that was `` not available'' to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors, who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, she said.

Both Ms. <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> testified with guaranteed immunity from prosecution by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s attorneys have said their client was hired specifically to get the documents for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, they were readily available to defense contractors, rules covering their release were unclear and charges were filed against him only after he refused to tell <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> inspectors who gave him the documents. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> from 1979 until he was fired in 1986. Three former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> security employees testified Tuesday that classified material was logged at the Seattle-based aerospace company's office in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. They said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> inspectors never raised questions about the documents listed in the logs. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Null </PERSON>, who was a clerk at the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> office from 1978 to 1984, testified that inspectors reviewed <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s classified record log twice a year and the log included specific references to the documents <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> is accused of obtaining illegally. Ms. <PERSON> Null </PERSON> also said that even though military rules required that she have receipts from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> before entering the documents in the log, DIS officials and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees including <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said it was no problem if she did n't.

Speaking to a group of senior banking officials, <PERSON> Nourbakhsh </PERSON> said the banks should invest in petrochemical, water and soil projects in the five-year plan. The five-year development plan was launched in March, but after his election in July, Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> announced some major changes in the program. The changes are subject to approval by the 270-member Parliament, or Majlis. Debate on the changes began in the Majlis Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of investors rushed to beat the Wednesday deadline for applying to buy shares in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s water industry under the government's $ 8.2 billion privatization of the business There had been concern the sale would attract little interest because of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> stock market's recent sluggishness. The privatization also has been strongly opposed by critics who say such a vital utility should remain in state hands for security reasons and to protect consumers from rate hikes. But a line stretched for some 250 yards outside <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> financial district as the 10 a.m. deadline approached. <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, privatization manager for <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION>, said the bank had handled previous sell-offs of government industries and `` I do n't think we have ever had a queue as long as this.'' Environment Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said, `` It is a reaffirmation of popular capitalism, and I am very pleased with that. It is obviously a very enthusiastic response.'' Some investors said their desire for profit outweighed any opposition they had to the sell-off. On the unofficial `` gray'' market, the share price is trading at a 27 percent premium to the government's offering price. `` I am not politically in favor of privatizing water, but if it's going to happen I may as well have a bit of it,'' said electrician <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, who applied for 2,500 shares. The government has structured the 140 pence-a-share sale so that investors put down 100 pence _ the equivalent of about $ 1.57 _ a share and pay the rest in installments spanning 20 months. <ORGANIZATION> Schroders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm advising the government in its latest privatization, said the sale of the 10 English and Welsh water authorities was `` well-subscribed.'' The offer is expected to be oversubscribed, but <ORGANIZATION> Schroders </ORGANIZATION> said exact information on the demand would not be available until later in the week, because hundreds of thousands of application forms were handed in at the last minute. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government has sold off billions of dollars worth of state-owned companies in the past decade. The government also is planning to sell <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s electricity industry by mid-1992, in what could be the biggest sale yet at an estimated $ 31 billion. Most sales, of such companies as <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, have been successful. However, the government's sale of its remaining one-third stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> flopped because it coincided with the October 1987 stock market crash When the government announced the price of the 2.183 million water shares last month, critics said the shares were priced too cheaply to attract buyers.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in active trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders reacted to prospects of increased export activity. Wheat led the way in the rally, with buying spurred by news that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has targeted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 1 million metric tons of wheat under the department's Export Enhancement Program. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. `` There is speculation that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be next'' to benefit from the program, said analyst <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators are trying to hammer out a new long-term grain pact. The current grain pact will expire next year. Corn futures were higher due to speculative demand resulting from the strong surge in wheat prices, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. The same held true for soybeans, which also drew support from slow farmer selling and reports of barge delays on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Analysts said prices were held back by a lack of export business, and news that Argentine farmers are enjoying adequate soil moisture and are moving ahead with soybean planting. At the close, wheat was 2 \ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.08 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.35 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cents to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents to 6 \ cents higher with January at $ 5.79

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the world's largest advertising and marketing services company, reported Wednesday it lost 58.5 million pounds, or $ 92 million, for its fiscal year, due to high costs and troubles with its consulting business While the loss was larger than many analysts had expected, they said that it resulted largely from management decisions to take some unusual writedowns. The loss for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 contrasted with a net profit of 75.1 million pounds, which is about $ 118 million, or 44.5 pence a share, in the previous year. Revenue totalled 973.5 million pounds, or $ 1.5 billion, up 13 percent from 862.2 million pounds a year earlier. <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> said its pre-tax profits sank 48 percent to 61.3 million pounds, or $ 96 million, from 117 million pounds, or $ 184 million, a year earlier. The company reported unusual costs of 39.5 million pounds, or $ 62 million, to cover potential rental costs of surplus office space and the cost of a reorganization and redundancies in the communications division, which includes advertising agencies. It also had an extraordinary cost of 22 million pounds, or $ 35 million, arising from its consulting business. Communication revenue rose 7.6 percent to 725 million pounds, or $ 1.1 billion, while consulting revenue rose 32 percent to 248.5 million pounds, or $ 390 million. `` The major problem this year has been costs rather than revenues,'' <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> has embarked on a number of changes in recent months, refocusing its business strategy away from consulting and adding several senior personnel. In October, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis-Dreyfus </PERSON> was appointed chief executive of the group. <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who follows the advertising agency business for <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` The significance of this report is that the new CEO seems to be cleaning house and forcing a hard look at the business.'' The company reportedly is having difficulty in getting the price it wants for its consulting businesses, which it bought for about 250 million pounds, or $ 393 million. <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> hopes to raise up to 350 million pounds, or about $ 550 million, from the sales. It has already sold three consulting businesses _ Gamma, <ORGANIZATION> MDK </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> _ for $ 25 million. It said in Wednesday's earnings announcement that it has also agreed to sell its interest in <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 12 million. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> had invested about $ 30 million in that operation, which was created about a year ago by a group that included some top-ranking executives from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and other accounting firms. He said the operation had been a drain on <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s earnings. <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> noted that its remaining consulting operations `` have strong brand names'' and said it `` is not prepared to give up these valuable assets for less than their market value.'' The company did n't break out quarterly or half-year results. It is n't required to under British law.

 The federal government should promote the study of foreign languages and countries by establishing an agency to address American shortcomings in the field, 165 business and teaching groups said Wednesday.

 Stock prices ended lower in listless trading today as investors remained cautious ahead of the government's unemployment report `` There's a lack of direction. People do n't know what to do,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're sitting around waiting for Friday's report.'' Data suggesting a further slowdown in economic growth likely would be positive for the market, analysts said, because it would raise expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would continue easing interest rates. A government report on third-quarter productivity and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s `` beige book'' summary of economic conditions, was generally neutral for the stock market, dealers said The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the third quarter while hours worked grew at a slower 1.3 percent, a sign of slackening demand for goods. However, the bond market, which had been stagnant in recent sessions, reacted negatively to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report, which said the nation's economy was `` stable to modestly expanding.'' Dealers said weakness in the credit market helped weaken stock prices after midday. Banking stocks highlighted selling activity after the government reported that the nation's commercial banks lost $ 744 million in the third quarter due partly to rising real estate loan problems. Weakness in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> stock led technology issues lower after gains in the previous two sessions. Dealers said investors were selling the stock amid uncertainty about the impact of a massive restructuring announced Tuesday.

 A sharp spike upward in heating oil prices helped carry energy futures higher on Wednesday.

 The dollar declined against most major foreign currencies in worldwide trading Wednesday as dealers kept their buying interest focused on West German marks. Gold prices edged slightly higher in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after turning in a mixed performance overseas. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold for current delivery ended at $ 404.90 a troy ounce, up $ 1.40 from late Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $ 404.60 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $ 1.10 from Tuesday's late bid. Currency dealers received an incentive to sell dollars from reports that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury official said the dollar's recent decline against the mark was not alarming, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Palladino </PERSON>, an assistant vice president in the <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. The remark attributed to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary, was interpreted to mean the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would not intervene aggressively in foreign exchange markets to stem the dollar's slide against the mark. `` It seems everybody is looking for a lower dollar,'' <PERSON> Palladino </PERSON> said. `` It's more of a mark-driven market than a dollar-driven market.'' Some dealers said the strength of the West German economy justified the rise in the mark's value. Demand for marks has surged as the borders between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have crumbled. The assumption is that liberalizations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could make the West German economy boom, possibly leading to higher interest rates in that country. Higher West German interest rates would tend to increase returns on mark-denominated investments. The dollar began its trading day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> by rising to a close of 143.75 Japanese yen from 143.68 yen on Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Wednesday, the dollar traded at 143.85 yen. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 144.025 yen, up from 143.70 yen late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.5765 late Wednesday from Tuesday's $ 1.5715. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.5765 from $ 1.5700. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.7660 West German marks, down from 1.7775; 1.5890 Swiss francs, down from 1.5915; 6.0325 French francs, down from 6.0670; 1,303.25 Italian lire, down from 1,309.00; and 1.16115 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1630. Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Tuesday's late rates included: 1.7648 West German marks, down from 1.7790; 1.5875 Swiss francs, down from 1.5910; 6.0315 French francs, down from 6.0675; 2.0010 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0100; 1,301.15 Italian lire, down from 1,307.00; and 1.1602 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1640. Precious metals prices were mixed and gold lost ground on several world markets as dealers sold to collect profits amassed during the recent surge in gold prices. Gold bullion prices dropped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major market, but were higher in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, ranging between $ 400 and $ 405 a troy ounce. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 402.25 a troy ounce, down from $ 404. The closing price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 403.75, up from $ 403.50.

<HEAD>Expectations of Increased Exports Send Grains, Soybeans Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in active trading Wednesday as traders reacted to prospects of increased export activity. In other markets, sugar prices surged, energy futures were higher, precious metals were firm, and livestock and pork futures were mixed. Wheat settled 2 \ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.08 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 2 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.36 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cents to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 \ cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with January at Wheat led the rally on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with buying spurred by news that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has targeted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 1 million metric tons of wheat under the department's Export Enhancement Program. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. `` There is speculation that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be next'' to benefit from the program, said analyst <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators are trying to hammer out a new long-term grain pact. The current grain pact will expire next year. Corn futures were higher due to speculative demand resulting from the strong surge in wheat prices, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. The same held true for soybeans, which also drew support from slow farmer selling and reports of barge delays on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Analysts said prices were held back by a lack of export business, and news that Argentine farmers are enjoying adequate soil moisture and are moving ahead with soybean planting. Sugar futures climbed dramatically on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders reacted to news that a <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> judge has banned the import of methanol to alleviate a shortage in fuel alcohol. The ban could divert sugar cane earmarked for export to the domestic fuel-alcohol industry, analysts said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 4 million automobiles operate on a mixture of methanol, ethanol _ sugar-based alcohol _ and gasoline. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is committed to export about 640,000 metric tons of sugar, and by importing methanol, sugar cane was freed for foreign markets. That could now change, analysts said. Sugar was .31 cent to .77 cent higher with January at 14 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures were higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar eased against foreign currencies. Underpinning precious metals is the belief interest rates are easing and the unstable situation in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> remains unstable, said analyst <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She noted that the December gold contract, which will cease trading on Dec. 27, held above the $ 400-an-ounce mark, an indication of market strength. Gold was $ 1.20 to $ 1.40 higher with December at $ 404.90 a troy ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.2. cents higher with December at $ 5.555 a troy ounce Energy futures rose on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, helped along by the strength in heating oil prices. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said unseasonably cold weather in many parts of the country has increased the demand for fuel. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> also said bullishness in the European energy market spilled over into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading and helped feed the optimism over higher prices. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 10 cents to 13 cents higher with January at $ 20.47 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to .57 cent higher with January at 64.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .33 cent to .57 cent higher with January at 53.17 cents a gallon. Livestock and pork futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .18 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at 75.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent higher with January at 82.92 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .25 cent higher with December at 51.32 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent lower to 1.20 cents higher with February at 56.45 cents a pound.

 Stock prices fell in listless trading Wednesday, reflecting investor caution ahead of the government's unemployment report later this week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slid 4.91 points to finish at 2,736.77, the first time since early November that it has fallen in two consecutive sessions. Declining issues narrowly outpaced advancers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 767 issues down, 714 up and 512 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 145.85 million shares, down from 154.64 million in the previous session. The market struggled through a lackluster session with banking and technology stocks taking the brunt of the selling activity. Wall Street analysts attributed the market's sluggishness to investor caution ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to provide a clearer picture about the outlook for interest rates. `` We still have n't gotten off the dime with regard to what we're doing and where we're going Interest rates remain a mystery and what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to do,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, head of equity trading for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are sitting here waiting for canned book numbers and employment numbers. Each day it's a new excuse not to invest,'' he said. If the data points to slower employment growth, it would confirm mounting evidence of a slowdown in economic growth. That would raise prospects the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would continue easing interest rates to stimulate growth, which would help corporate earnings, analysts said. A government report on third-quarter productivity and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Beige Book'' summary of economic conditions was generally neutral for the market. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, while hours worked grew at a slower 1.3 percent, a sign of slackening demand for goods. However, the bond market, which had been stagnant in recent sessions, reacted negatively to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report, which said the nation's economy was generally `` stable to modestly expanding.'' Traders said weakness in the credit market helped depress stock prices. Despite the caution, most analysts said the stock market showed signs it is working its way into a yearend rally. `` The averages are moving up relieving the oversold conditions that developed in October,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, manager of market analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 176.42 million shares As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market slipped $ 4.164 billion, or 0.12 percent, in value from Tuesday.

<HEAD>Plans Restructuring to Eliminate 1,000 Jobs, Take $220 Million Writedown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Publishing and information services giant <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was eliminating more than 1,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its fulltime positions, and taking a big charge in a restructuring to cut costs. The company said it would take one-time pretax charges of $ 220 million, or $ 152 million after taxes, in the fourth quarter for writing down the value of assets, closing its <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> unit and setting up a reserve for employee severance payments. Analysts said the job cuts were overdue and that the writedowns fit a pattern of recent refiguring of asset values in the publishing business. But investors sent <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>'s stock down following the announcement, in apparent disappointment at the company's projection of earnings for 1990 despite the charges being taken this year In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> closed down $ 2 a share at $ 61.50. The company did not specify where the job eliminations would be, but indicated many would be corporate positions rather than in operating units, which include <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's debt rating service. `` The effort to improve productivity and make the organization leaner is a step in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, media analyst for <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But he said the company should do more. `` Operating margins in some of their units are low by industry standards,'' <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> said, citing TV station operations and some information services units. He said the stock market's negative reaction to the announcement would do nothing to improve the company's position as a frequent subject of takeover speculation. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, called the announcement `` one of the more decisive things'' <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> has done. `` They have done a lot of fiddling with operations in the past,'' he said. But he said Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON>'s statement that next year's earnings excluding non-recurring gains would be within a range of $ 3.50 to $ 4 a share surprised analysts who follow publishing companies. `` It's a sign that business is n't really good,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> and the overall industry. `` The outlook was a lot worse than anybody expected,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Asscoaites </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` It indicates a softer than expected outlook for the school publishing business and a general slowing of the economy.'' Several publishing companeies recently have taken writedowns, including <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foresman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for less than it paid for the unit three years ago and expects to take a pretax charge of $ 175 million on the deal. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said the charges include a $ 145 million asset writedown, including the shutdown of General Books and writedowns at the Data Resources economic forecasting unit. The company declined to provide figures on the size of the book unit, which sells general interest books. It also said it would establish a $ 75 million reserve for severance payments connected with the staff cuts. The company said it planned to scrap its current internal structure of three operating companies _ publishing, financial services and information services _ and have all operations report to one of two new corporate executive vice presidents reporting to <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON>. One new executive vice president is <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, great-grandson of the company's founder and now in charge of overseeing the financial services, Business Week, broadcasting, aerospace and defense groups. He had been head of financial services. The other, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serwatka </PERSON>, will be responsible for the construction, education, professional publishing, legal and computers and communications groups. He had headed information services. `` Adopting this streamlined corporate structure eliminates an entire layer of staffing and related expenses associated with the three operating companies,'' <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> said in a statement. The rest of the jobs being eliminated will result from the previously-disclosed plans to automate delivery of the F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reports on the construction industry and from corporate staff reductions, spokesman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Trisler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> currently employs about 13,700 people, meaning the reductions would amount to a 7 percent cut in staffing. The company earned $ 54.97 million, or $ 1.13 a share, on revenue of $ 507.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. It earned $ 185.5 million, or $ 3.83 a share, on revenue of $ 1.82 billion for all of 1988.

 The nation's unprecedented peacetime economic expansion, now in its eighth year, will last at least three more years, the nation's top business economists said Wednesday. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported current economic activity ranging from stable to expanding modestly. Consumer spending varies around the country, it said, but prices range from flat to increasing modestly. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> said the latest survey of its members found 62 percent expecting no recession for the next three years. That expectation is `` a sea change,'' according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the organization's president and financial professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. Commenting that economists rarely agree on anything, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` We never, ever had not just a majority, but an overwhelming majority, forecasting growth over three years.'' But nearly 20 percent of the 59 business economists surveyed said they felt a recession could occur before next April. The economy has slowed considerably since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> began boosting interest rates to restrain rising prices. As inflationary pressures moderated, however, the central bank has gradually let rates fall. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, in its latest survey of the economy, said that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> districts that reported on prices generally noted flat to modest increases, `` with several mentioning the continuing escalation of medical insurance costs.'' Most of its districts `` describe economic activity as stable to modestly expanding. ... Consumer spending has varied'' and `` strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items, while sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak.'' The central bank said that most districts reported softening in manufacturing and that while construction is strong or improving in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, it is sluggish elsewhere. Agriculture has improved in much of the country, it said. The survey by the 12 district banks is compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> every six weeks to prepare for meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the bank's monetary policy-setting arm. The material was gathered prior to Nov. 28. The committee is scheduled to meet Dec. 18. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking to reporters after the survey was released, said that while the automobile and housing industries were weak, he believed the overall economy would be kept out of a recession by strength in other areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, said continued growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and strength in sales of consumer goods other than autos should be enough to keep the economy moving forward in the coming year. Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> should ease interest rates further to fight weakness in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as autos and housing, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official said, `` I think we need further evidence from those sectors to see whether they were responding to our past actions'' before making any further moves to ease credit. The business economists' forecast was considerably more optimistic than recent surves by the organization. Last May, for instance, 63 percent of the economists said they expected a recession next year. Three months later, 37 percent still forecast a recession in 1990. But the economists predicted that the gross national product _ the nation's total output of goods and services _ will continue to grow slowly, dropping from the 2.9 percent forecast for 1989 to 1.8 percent next year. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that since 1983, the economists have been within one percentage point of forecasting the following year's gross national product. At the same time, the economists predicted further easing of both inflation and interest rates. They said the consumer price index will fall from the 4.8 percent forecast for 1989 to 4.2 percent next year. But their report said that `` the slower overall growth and weaker industrial production is not expected to be reflected in higher unemployment.'' It said unemployment would rise only from 5.3 percent this year to 5.5 percent next year. While they forecast improvements in the housing industry, they saw no relief for the automobile industry next year. Both industries have been adversely affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s interest rate policies. And the forecasters predicted the nation's twin deficits in merchandise trade and the federal budget would narrow, but `` only very slowly.'' `` For 1990, the trade imbalance should be about $ 100 billion,'' which would be down from $ 109 billion in 1989, `` and federal spending will exceed revenue by $ 141 billion'' after a reported $ 152 billion deficit in fiscal 1989, they said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday a federal judge has approved a $ 6.25 million settlement of shareholders' lawsuits from 1986 that accused some officers and directors of violating securities laws. The settlement of derivative and class-action lawsuits will be funded by the officers and directors' liability insurance of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The Pittsburgh-based small appliance manufacturer will not be required to spend any of its own money to satisfy claims. Under terms of the settlement approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, the company will receive $ 1 million. <ORGANIZATION> Decatur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will receive $ 337,428 to settle its claim, and all legal expenses and legal fees will be deducted from the gross amount. The rest of the fund will be divided among investors who bought <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> common stock, preferred stock and subordinated debentures between Aug. 1, 1985, and April 18, 1986. Class members are eligible to receive compensation if they have not excluded themselves from the class and file timely proofs of claims. Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, have filed a competing reorganization plan in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the financially troubled company. The plan marks the first time any group other than the company has filed a reorganization plan since <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> lost its exclusive right to do so in June. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has operated under Chapter 11 of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy laws for almost two years. During that time, the company proposed nine reorganization plans, the latest of which was submitted last week. The proposal does not specify whether assets should be sold, although the unsecured creditors previously have called for the sale of the company's flagship Oster-Sunbeam small appliance unit. Like the company's most recent proposal, the creditors' plan would repay most of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 740 million in debts with new stock. Its plan would issue virtually no cash to anyone other than trade creditors, however, while the company's plan would distribute $ 200 million in cash, most of it to bank lenders. Those lenders would get only notes and stock under the unsecured creditors' proposal. Unsecured creditors would become the company's majority stockholders and gain the right to name most directors. Most creditors would get between 48 and 75.5 shares of common stock in the reorganized company for each $ 1,000 they are owed. Current shareholders would get only 1.5 percent of the reorganized company's shares, the same as envisioned in the company's plan.

<HEAD>Shell Announces $1.1 Billion Oil Development in Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a plan Wednesday to build the deepest-water oil and natural gas production platform in the world at a cost of about $ 1.1 billion. The company said it was soliciting bids to build and install a tension leg platform in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 2,860 feet of water, which is more than half a mile deep. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said it would be a world water-depth record. The tension leg platform, which employs a relatively new type of technology, will be in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> about 255 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Last month, a tension leg platform built by <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in 1,760 feet of water was declared operational. It is the world's deepest oil and natural gas production platform in operation. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said the cost of the `` Auger'' project, estimated at $ 1.1 billion, will include fabrication and installation of the platform, development drilling, complete production facilities and pipelines. `` The Auger TLP -LRB- tension leg platform -RRB- represents another giant step toward narrowing the gap between the industry's ability to explore and its ability to produce,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. `` This project exemplifies <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing commitment to develop the technology necessary to produce our nation's frontier oil and gas reserves. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said the platform will be the first <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tension leg platform to support a drilling rig and complete production facilities. Initial development will begin about mid-1990, and the drilling rig and production facilities will be installed in 1993. The rig will have 32 well slots. The facility will be able to drill 15,000 to 20,000 feet sub-sea, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Production is expected to begin in 1993 and will increase to a projected peak rate of 40,000 barrels of oil per day in 1995, and 150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the year 2001. A tension platform rig floats at the surface of the water and is connected to a foundation template on the sea floor by tubular steel tendons. The buoyancy of the platform creates an upward force that puts the tendons in tension, eliminating vertical motion and holding the platform in place.

 Federal officials have broadened their investigation into the dealings of former <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, his attorney said Wednesday, the same day the last of seven former officers of the thrift was convicted of soliciting kickbacks. Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravkind </PERSON> said he received a second letter Wednesday notifying him <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> is the target of a federal investigation. <PERSON> Ravkind </PERSON> would not say what areas the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was investigating, nor what a previous target letter had outlined. Prosecutors would not comment on the investigation. <PERSON> Ravkind </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> eventually would be indicted. `` I do n't have any way of knowing where this investigation is headed, -LRB- but -RRB- I do n't think they'll bring anything until they've completed the entire investigation,'' he said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> currently faces no criminal charges, although he is the lead defendant in a $ 540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in 1987. <PERSON> Ravkind </PERSON> said that suit is on hold pending the outcome of any criminal investigation. Earlier Wednesday, former Vernon Chairman <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON> was convicted of soliciting $ 221,000 in kickbacks from Vernon transactions in 1985 and 1986. Lemons is the seventh, and highest ranking, former Vernon official either to plead guilty to or be convicted of crimes stemming from their actions at the thrift, which was seized by federal regulators in 1987 in a then-record bailout. Lemons' conviction wraps all current outstanding cases connected to <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, which frequently is cited as an example of some of the industry's worst abuses. He was convicted on 13 charges accusing him of soliciting a $ 9,000 kickback from a <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> loan broker in 1985 and receiving $ 212,000 from the broker in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> set sentencing for Jan. 18. Lemons, who remained free on bond, could be sentenced to up to 65 years in jail and fined as much as $ 500,000. Prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is continuing to investigate <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> and other thrifts for possible charges.

 The cost of living rose 6.5 percent in November, indicating inflation is heating up at a time the government had promised it would be stamped out. The monthly hike was the second-lowest this year, but it was higher than the 5.6 percent tallied in October, reversing a trend that had been downward since July. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who took office on July 8, pledged that a 54 percent devaluation and massive hikes in public service rates he implemented on July 9 would result in inflation of only 2 percent in December. The cost of living so far this year has soared by 3,486 percent, including a hyperinflationary 197 percent in July. For the 12-month period through November, it rose by 3,731 percent. With <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s currency, the austral, trading on the black market at about 33 percent below its official value, newspapers in the capital <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> speculated Wednesday that another devaluation was imminent.

 <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> extended his stock-picking prowess to <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as his <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bought 300,000 shares of preferred stock for $ 300 million. <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> bought a new series of convertible stock that gives the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based company about 8 percent of shareholders' voting rights in Champion, a paper products company with $ 5.1 billion in sales last year <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> will have voting rights with the preferred stock `` because that's how it's negotiated,'' said Champion spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` We are delighted to place this issue with a long-term investor who has such an outstanding reputation,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON>, Champion's chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> is famous for buying stock in companies that turn out to be good long-term investments. His picks include <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The big thing about <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> is he's in for the long term,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, `` and that has been what our chairman, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON>, has been saying for years and years _ that to be competitive worldwide you must make capital investments over the long term.'' Stamford-based Champion makes paper primarily for copiers, magazines, catalogs and newspapers. The company owns 6.4 million acres of timberland in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and also makes plywood and lumber. It is a leader in an industry that has enjoyed record profits in the last few years. But some analysts have predicted a 6-month to two-year downturn in the industry because of overcapacity and a corresponding drop in prices. For the three quarters ended Sept. 30, Champion had net income of $ 329.4 million on sales of $ 3.896 billion, down from a profit of $ 336.5 million on sales of $ 3.814 billion in the first three quarters of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 285.7 million on sales of $ 2 billion last year. Champion issued the shares at $ 1,000 each, with each share guaranteed a dividend of 9.25 percent, or $ 92.50 per year, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. The stock is convertible to common stock, which can reap higher profits but is riskier because it is not guaranteed a dividend. `` The board of directors has the authority from time to time to issue preference stock, as opposed to common stock,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` We have not done that very much but it's being done on a series-by-series basis.'' He said each preferred share carries about 26.3 votes, or a total 7.5 million votes, on all issues submitted to shareholders. That gives <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> about 8 percent of the voting rights, based on 91 million to 92 million shares of outstanding common stock. <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> agreed to limit its ownership in Champion to 18 percent for the next 10 years unless Champion's board approves an increase. <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> also agreed to certain restrictions on reselling the shares.

<HEAD>Employee Buyout Plan Presented to Flight Attendants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> presented their revised proposal for an employee buyout of the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, officials said. The presentation of the new buyout offer came at what was to be the opening session of a new round of contract negotiations between flight attendants and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants have been working without a contract for two years. The airline's management has been seeking salary and work rule consessions from the attendants, union officials said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, outgoing president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants union, refused to comment on Wednesday's talks, only to confirm that a revised employee buyout plan had been presented. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, also refused to comment on the talks. Analysts believe the management buyout plan will value the company at $ 210 to $ 240 a share, or a total of $ 4.75 billion to $ 5.42 billion. It is believed officials of the Chicago-based company are seeking ironclad commitments from lenders and the company's three major unions before publicly announcing any buyout offer. The previous buyout effort, led by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s management, pilots and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, failed in October when lenders refused to finance it. The lenders cited the strong opposition of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents about 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 employees. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union have refused to comment on the latest buyout proposal.

 The possible emergence of a third major outside investor in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> could be a thorn in running the troubled investment firm but Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> does n't have much choice, analysts said Wednesday. `` He's got to go somewhere to get some more capital and when you need more equity capital you've got to pay the price,'' said securities industry analyst <ORGANIZATION> Perrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> reportedly is negotiating to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION> in exchange for a large stake in the brokerage firm At the same time, the brokerage reportedly is preparing to raise up to $ 1 billion through a new securities offering. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> would invest $ 250 million in exchange for a stake in the company of about 9.9 percent, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday editions. On Wednesday, the Times reported that <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> would be able to obtain about 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, or 17.5 million shares, if he exercised all of his stock options under the deal as originally proposed. The Times said in Thursday editions that the planned transaction was altered to make it less complex, according to the unidentified sources it cited. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> declined to comment on the report in Wednesday's Times. Any such deal would provide needed capital for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, which is 61 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. About 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s stock is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with the rest publicly traded But <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said that further dividing the ownership of Shearson among three large outsiders could prove to be a headache for executives under pressure to turn around the firm's slumping profits. A number of Wall Street observers have been waiting for <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> to make a move. He had been divesting some operations and amassing a warchest of hundreds of millions of dollars for some time. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> was rebuffed two years ago in an effort to buy a block of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and some say he still wants to obtain a position of authority at a brokerage firm. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also was said to be considering other deals, such as obtaining more capital from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for selling certain of the brokerage's assets, the Times said. The Times said as many as seven investors had expressed interest in buying into the firm.
