<TEXT>
 Yellowstone National Park got its first significant rainfall since Memorial Day on Friday, and the rain and cooler temperatures aided firefighters battling a 40,000-acre fire. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plane was killed Friday when his plane crashed while surveying a fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, authorities said. Fires also burned in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Yellowstone received about two hours of intermittent rainfall Friday. `` One short rain shower is not adequate to douse the fires. But it does help increase humidity in the air and it helps slow the fires down,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. She said the temperature in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> cooled down Friday afternoon, the wind slowed and firefighters made some progress in their efforts to contain fires burning on nearly 200,000 acres of the park. Park officials on Friday morning reopened a road between <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> and Old Faithful that had been closed Thursday because of the fire and smoke. The fire, pushed east by winds whipping at up to 40 mph Thursday, had crossed the road in several spots near <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> as it grew by about 3,000 acres during the day. The fire's north edge was about 1 -LCB- miles south of the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> campground, which remained open, and wind was pushing the flames to the east into backcountry, <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. The 20,260-acre Fan fire in the park's northwestern corner remained inside containment lines and burning had slowed on the Shoshone and Red fires, which had charred about 34,000 acres. Despite the fires, tourism in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> remains high, <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. `` We are continuing to see a very busy park with campgrounds and hotels full each night,'' she said. `` But the last two days, there have been fairly smoky conditions in the park and the vicinity, so that has been difficult for everyone.'' In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, cool, cloudy weather slowed a 2,800-acre fire burning in the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> Friday. Fire crews continued the slow work of building fire lines by hand in steep terrain, forest officials said. The cool weather also helped 125 firefighters battling an 8,000-acre grass and range fire southeast of <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, fire crews carved a break line between the raging 4,000 <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire and the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Inkom </LOCATION> on Friday. Residents from 16 rural homes were evacuated Thursday when flames whipped by 60 mph gusts swept over thousands of acres of sage, grass and groves of trees. The families stayed away from their homes Friday, and residents of 32 other homes were warned they might have to leave their homes. No structures were lost and no injuries were reported. Hundreds of firefighters were strung out across the southern part of the state against the worst of more than 75 fires started by lightning Thursday. `` We're snowed under here just trying to get people on fires,'' <ORGANIZATION> Challis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` We're going to be really thin on resources.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, where Thursday's storm sparked 20 new fires, some 180 firefighters tried to regain containment of the 1,000-acre Ruby Rapids fire after wind-driven flames broke through the containment line. Fire bosses hoped to recontain the fire by day's end and control it Saturday. Crews finally controlled the stubborn 1,500-acre Spring Canyon II fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> border Thursday night, and fire bosses were hoping to begin demobilization this weekend.

<DATELINE>GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A vacationing couple stopped at a fast-food restaurant and left with a 5-pound, 4-ounce baby girl instead of the burger and fries they planned to purchase. <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, was born Aug. 3 in a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in Magog, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, about 35 miles from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> border. The child, the <ORGANIZATION> Nelsons </ORGANIZATION>' third, was n't due until Sept. 1, <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It was the weirdest vacation I ever had in my life,'' her husband said. The couple was driving with their son <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, 1, to the wedding of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s brother in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> when Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said she had a backache and asked her husband to stop at a restroom. They saw a McDonald's sign and decided to stop for a bite to eat at the same time. Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 33, who said she experienced no other signs of labor, gave birth in the restroom and called for her husband. But he had taken <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> back to the car to wait for her. Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said she was trying to wash the baby in the restroom sink when a young girl entered and then went for help. Meanwhile, after several minutes of waiting in the car, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 29, said he figured something was wrong and he and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> returned to the restaurant. `` I saw a bunch of people by the bathroom ... and my wife holding a baby,'' he said. `` It was just a shock to me.'' A rescue squad took Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and the baby to a hospital. As word of the unusual birth spread, the story was relayed in French on <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> television and radio and in local newspapers, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The couple discovered through a television report translated for them that the owner-operator of the restaurant, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, was going to pay for their hospital and ambulance costs, which totaled almost $ 1,700, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> also paid for some baby clothes, diapers and an infant car seat, according to <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s restaurants. That was good news for the couple because they have no health insurance. `` We would have paid so much a month like we do all our other bills,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> is a cook at the Downtowner in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, and his wife is a hostess at a <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>'s Big Boy, where she returned to work Thursday.

<HEAD>Oregon Town Refuses to Concede Shortest River Title to Montana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN CITY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thanks to the meddling of a group of sharp-eyed <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> fifth graders, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s `` D River'' has lost its 30-year title as the world's shortest river, but not without a fight from miffed local officials. Editors of the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> agreed to give the title to the <LOCATION> Roe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, after students there spent the past school year researching the river, which flows through a state park. The students concluded the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> is 201 feet, far shorter than the 440-foot D <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and submitted their evidence to the Guinness editors. `` On the basis of that, the <LOCATION> Roe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was shorter,'' assistant editor <PERSON> Cyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said from the publisher's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. News of the change was not well-received in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, however, where the D River has held the title of shortest named river for 30 years. `` Where a river begins and ends may be in the eye of the beholder,'' Mayor <PERSON> Dell </PERSON> <PERSON> Isham </PERSON> said Wednesday. In fact, <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> now insists the D is only 120 feet long, give or take 5 feet. City officials are preparing documentation to convince Guinness editors that they were right the first time and that the D River should regain its rightful title in the book's 1990 edition The deadline is past for next year's edition. Of course, the question being asked in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> is: How can a river shrink from 440 feet to 120 feet? At first it was funny, but fewer people are laughing now that it's clear <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is serious. `` It's fun to a point, but it has no end when people can come back and keep shortening it until it's kind of ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardinger </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> teacher who led her class in the river study. The <LOCATION> Roe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s acceptance into the records book is a matter of pride to the community's 60,000 residents, she said. `` Our students went about it perfectly innocently,'' she said. `` The victory has been marred because <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> came out with its claims and, in a sense, stole the limelight at the peak of their success.'' Signs soon will grace the banks of the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> to proclaim its world-class status. About 625 miles away in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, similar signs remain along the <LOCATION> D </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and there are no plans to remove them. <PERSON> Isham </PERSON> says the dispute is simply a matter of setting the record straight. <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> insists previous estimates of the river's length inaccurately measured from a point in the river that actually is part of Devil's <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> That point looked like part of the river because a landfill had closed in the banks of the lake, <PERSON> Isham </PERSON> said. A spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> says the states' governors could get out their yardsticks and settle the issue once and for all. `` If it's a good, honest fight, we'll be there,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON> said. `` But it'll always be the shortest river in our hearts.''

<BYLINE>Rising Interest Rates Affecting Markets</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 At a glance, these are among the latest economic developments:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRIME RATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Several major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks on Thursday raised their prime rate a half percentage point to 10 percent, just two days after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent to stave off inflation. The increase brings the prime rate to its highest level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from 10 percent. It was the third time this year that banks have raised the prime, used to calculate a range of fixed and adjustable rate corporate and consumer loans.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July, the third consecutive monthly increase. Sales increased $ 632 million to a seasonally adjusted $ 134.0 billion, but economists say rising interest rates threaten to dampen even this modest growth in the months ahead. The rise followed increases of 0.4 percent in June and 0.8 percent in May.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CROP REPORT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has reported that drought and high temperatures have shriveled the harvest of the nation's No. 1 crop, corn, to an estimated 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from 7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987. The drought will cause consumer food prices to go up an average 3 percent to 5 percent from 1987. Before the heat and dry weather, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices hovered in a narrow range Thursday, struggling to stabilize after the market's recent steep decline. Analysts said the market's drop over the past week had pushed prices down to levels where they attracted some buyers. But they also said widespread concern persisted over the recent rise in interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly 00 points over the five previous sessions, on Thursday rose 5.16 to 2,039.30.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOUSING ACTIVITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported home prices soared on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in the April-June period, propelled by that region's booming economy, while prices lagged in depressed oil areas. The median price of existing single-family homes jumped to $ 204,000 in the <LOCATION> Anaheim-Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a 20.1 percent increase when compared with the second quarter of 1987. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, with an appreciation rate of 19.1 percent, ranked second in the nation and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, with an increase of 15.5 percent, was third. The steepest declines from a year ago were in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the median resale price fell 12.7 percent to $ 56,900. Nationally, prices rose 3.4 percent to a median of $ 88,900, meaning half of the houses sold for more and half for less.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: For Shultz, A Bad Week for Nicaragua Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> can point to some recent successes around the world lately. Then there's <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> While <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has seen progress in such areas as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, this has been a particularly bad week for the administration in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> found little evidence of support either in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for his policies and considerable evidence that the Contra rebels are becoming a spent force. As <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was winding up his 10-day hemispheric tour Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the Contra aid program began was rejecting a proposal for military aid for the rebels. A Democratic package was approved instead that includes the possibility of eventual military aid, but there are so many strings attached that administration officials are viewing it as a defeat. For one thing, the legislation does not ensure weapons delivery to Contras inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> even if all the other considitions for release are met. Meanwhile, the Contras themselves are looking more and more like a refugee force than a fighting force. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials dispatched to the border area of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Monday were horrified by new evidence of a policy gone awry. The last of a group of about 1,000 Nicaraguans, including 250 Contras and 750 Nicaraguan civilians, made it to the Honduran side of the border area after an arduous weeks-long trek through rugged terrain. Many were sick or hungry or both. Many were practically naked, their boots and clothing having disintegrated along the route. They went to the border because that's where the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, unable to send food to the rebels inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, has set up feeding centers for Contras and other refugees from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s turmoil. Since the cease-fire in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> went into effect last March, thousands of rebels have sought refuge in that area. The question of assessing blame for the plight of the Contras, who oppose <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, will be debated for years to come. The Republicans will accuse the Democrats of betraying a brave people who took up arms on the promise of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. The Democrats will counter that the commitment to start down that path was ill-advised to begin with. In any case, the peace process is moribund and the rebel cause has never seemed more hopeless. In the absence of military aid for the Contras, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has sought alternate means of bringing pressure to bear on the Sandinista government to encourage a democratic evolution. At the start of his recent trip, he went to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, hoping to come away with a joint statement from four friendly Central American foreign ministers designed to prod the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> into making democratic reforms. The effort did not bear fruit, partly because the most reluctant of the four parties _ <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> _ did not want to sign a document that had the appearance of having a `` Made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` label. Beyond that, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has been generally accommodating in other Third World trouble spots, appears to have dug in its heels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, rejecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals for a reduction in military aid to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>. At current delivery rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will receive more than $ 300 million worth of Soviet lethal aid this year, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates. So the view here is that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, despite persistent economic problems, are more entrenched than ever. They have unswerving support from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and irresolute opposition from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which soon may have the added burden of figuring out what to do with thousands of Contra fighters-turned-refugees amassed along the border of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, neither of which wants them. With no other obvious alternative, their best hope may be obtaining a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> green card, a problem that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor could well inherit

<HEAD>Sleeping On Job At Nuclear Plant Sparks Record $1.25 Million Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A record $ 1.25 million fine against the operator of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> nuclear plant whose workers slept on duty is meant to wake up utilities and show them that such violations carry a price, says a government regulator. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the dormant <LOCATION> Peach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bottom </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in southeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, was hit Thursday with the fine, the largest in Nuclear Regulatory Commission history. Sleeping on the job was so common at Peach Bottom that on one occasion, a shift superintendent and three of the four reactor operators all dozed at once, according to testimony by an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official last year. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> also announced fines ranging from $ 500 to $ 1,000 against the 33 present and former reactor operators _ the first such civil penalties ever proposed for individual operators. It said the 33 fines `` involved sleeping and-or other acts of inattention to duty'' at the plant on the <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> called the levies `` proposed fines,'' explaining that both <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and the operators have 30 days to either admit or deny the alleged violations. If they deny the allegations, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff will review their complaints before deciding whether to uphold the penalties. Peach Bottom, which is capable of producing 1 million kilowatts of electric power, was ordered shut down by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on March 31, 1987. The commission said the plant posed `` an immediate threat to the public health and safety.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy executive director for regional operations, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> that the commission recognized that the utility had made `` extensive personnel changes'' since then and had ordered reactor operators retrained. But <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the fines were necessary to demonstrate to the company and to other utilities `` the significance of the problem, and to ensure that corrective actions are long lasting.'' In addition, he said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> action should `` emphasize to all licensees that, in addition to the cost of corrective action, a licensee may face the additional costs of sanctions for significant safety violations.'' <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> officials said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Holtwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, that they had not decided whether to appeal the record fine. `` We have a period of time to evaluate and make that decision. We have not made it yet,'' Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON> said no rate increases would stem from the fine and that the company does not expect to seek a rate hike until after its <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> II power plant in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> becomes operational, possibly in 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the company was `` relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and that we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the Peach Bottom restart plan.'' In addition to the fines, the commission barred the utility from placing `` in any operational position'' three officials who were top-level managers at the plant in 1987. The officials held the positions of operations engineer, superintendent of operations and plant manager. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive vice president for nuclear operations, said the officials are still with the company, but they have been assigned to other, non-nuclear responsibilities. The fine is the largest since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> authority to issue civil penalties in 1969. The previous high was a $ 900,000 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for an incident in which the <LOCATION> Davis-Besse </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> had a temporary loss of cooling water. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> that he was pleased with the fine, but wished the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> had gone further and suspended or revoked the licenses of control room operators. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which still hopes to obtain <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> permission to restart the plant, said the action has cost shareholders $ 86 million because of the cost of purchasing replacement power. Peach Bottom is owned by a group of utilities. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns about 42.5 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delmarva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> own 7.5 percent each, and <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> owns about 42.5 percent and operates the plant.

<TEXT>
 Of course President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is playing politics these days, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s protestations notwithstanding. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have a lot more to lament if the White House were playing it any other way. The vice president said the other day that he guessed it was inevitable for people to see political motives behind <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decisions on Cabinet appointments, vetoes and policy decisions `` But I certainly wo n't add any validity to the charge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. It really is n't much of a charge. It is so standard as to be an election-year cliche. Politicians are always accusing each other of playing politics, which is rather ironic since that's what they do for a living. Besides, there's really nothing wrong with it. That is the way issues are defined and put to the voters. If they do n't like what they see, they can vote for the other candidate. Presidents have not always been so helpful to their vice presidents in campaigns to succeed them. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> did n't do a lot for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1960. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s handling of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war issues in his final months probably hurt <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s ticket in 1968 Both those vice presidents lost. No president can deliver nomination, let alone election, to his vice president or any other candidate. But presidents certainly can help, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is. He has promised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> two campaign appearances a week from Labor Day on, and his White House actions in these waning days of his administration are at least as significant an assist. `` I'm just still working on the job here,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday when questions were raised about political motivation in his appointment of a Hispanic educator to become secretary of education. A month earlier, the vice president had promised an association of Latin citizens that he would choose a Hispanic for a seat in a Bush Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was consulted before <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was appointed to the education post. But he said he was n't claiming credit or responsibility for it. The influence, or interests, of the vice president were evident in an assortment of other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> moves, including: _ His decision not to veto a bill to require advance notice to workers when there are to be plant closings or major layoffs <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> let the bill become law without his signature, rather than revive an issue the Democrats welcomed in congressional as well as presidential politics. _ The selection of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confidant, to become secretary of the treasury, succeeding <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> to take command of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign _ The veto of a $ 299.5 billion defense budget bill on grounds it sought to lock the administration into weapons programs favored by the Democrats Defense and foreign policy are issues on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes he can master Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; the veto guarantees a new round of action on defense spending during the campaign. _ The signing on Wednesday of a bill to pay reparations to Japanese Americans because of internments during World War II That's particularly significant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which is where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the idea during the primary election campaign. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> originally objected to the cost, but embraced a bill with a ceiling on appropriations. _ An apparent switch in signals on a Contra aid bill that passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night over solid Republican opposition The Democratic bill provides $ 27 million in so-called humanitarian aid, but no arms for Contras fighting the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The military aid issue was left open for possible action later. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors the full array of Contra aid. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, has voted for it in the past. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is opposed to military aid to the Contras. Republican campaigners do n't want that ticket split forgotten. Not that the Democrats are without resources of their own. They do run <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and as opportunities arise this fall, they will use that control to the advantage of their candidates and the disadvantage of Republicans. And, in turn, Republicans will accuse them of playing politics.

<TEXT>
 More than three months after her death, the body of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother is still unburied as her son's dwindling followers maintain a wake in hopes the government will allow him to come home. But civic leaders say that even here in `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> country,'' many believe the time has come to place the body of <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> in the marble tomb prepared for her in the family cemetery in a swamp on the eastern edge of this town. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> died May 4 at age 95, and her body was transferred the following month from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ancestral home in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, a town of about 50,000 people about 240 miles to the north. Family members and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters say no date for the burial will be set until President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> allows her deposed predecessor to return or until <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> orders the interment. The body has been embalmed at least twice, and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family mortician <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> said the remains could remain unburied until the end of the year. The former president has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since a civilian-military uprising toppled his 20-year administration in 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow him back for security reasons. `` To be frank with you, we have not been able to set a definite date,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' sister <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barba </PERSON>, who attends daily prayer services before the open coffin in the family home. The mansion is now a museum. Pictures of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, hang from the walls alongside banners such as: `` God's will, I'll return to save my nation and people from communism.'' `` We're still hoping, perhaps against hope, that the situation will change and something good may come out of it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barba </PERSON> said. Whatever sympathy <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> may have hoped to generate by his appeal to come home appears to have dissipated in the months following his mother's death. Filipino newspapers rarely mention the ongoing wake. In a rare exception, The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> recently suggested an epitaph: `` Here lies <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, died at age 95, buried at age 96.'' <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Farinas </PERSON>, provincial governor of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> and a close friend of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family, said if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> believes he has no chance to return, `` he should give the word that his mother should be laid to rest.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abaya </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest, said the arrival of Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' body generated considerable enthusiasm in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION> because many believed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was returning for the funeral. Pro-Marcos politicians erected red, white and blue signs in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION> and in neighboring towns welcoming the former president to his provincial stronghold. But as the weeks dragged on without the Apo, or Grand Old Man, both the signs and the enthusiasm are fading. Under a rotation system, residents take turns attending daily prayers before the casket. But attendance has dwindled from hundreds to a few dozens each day. `` The feeling seems to be that the woman has suffered enough and should be laid to rest,'' <PERSON> Abaya </PERSON> said. Vice Mayor <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yadao </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> party, said townspeople were still eager for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. <PERSON> Yadao </PERSON> said, however, that townspeople were losing patience with his nearly fanatical supporters from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> who came here for the wake. `` We have to provide for them,'' <PERSON> Yadao </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes, they are quarelling with themselves. She should be buried now. That is our tradition.'' He was referring to the practice of burying people within nine days of death. At <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about six miles north, the military has placed metal barricades, mounds of gravel and six concrete abutments on the runway, shortening it by 1,200 yards to prevent <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from slipping in on a charter flight from abroad. Some <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters vow to continue the wake indefinitely until their leader returns. But asked if the family were prepared for an indefinite standoff, Mrs. <PERSON> Barba </PERSON> replied: `` Well, I suppose if there is no hope, I'll get a call from him one day telling me to go ahead with it.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Major Parts of FBI Agent's Racial Harassment Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major portions of a black <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent's racial harassment lawsuit against the government have been dismissed as technically defective, but the plaintiff's lawyer says the ruling ultimately will be a victory. Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said many of the legal flaws found by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> in agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s complaint can be corrected and the case will go forward. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer said <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s order Thursday leaves the essential element of the case intact. `` He has upheld our ability to get personal damages against the individual wrongdoers,'' <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said. `` This is very important and was not a matter of certainty when we started this.'' In a highly technical opinion, <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> dismissed `` without prejudice'' most of the claims against 21 white <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, whom <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> contends engaged in a three-year campaign of harassment that included anonymous telephone calls, obscene mail and death threats. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> also contends agents threatened his white wife with sexual assault. The `` without prejudice'' proviso <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> attached to most of the dismissals gives <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> an opportunity to file a new complaint to try to correct the legal defects identified by the judge. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said the complaint, while raising `` repugnant and chilling'' allegations, `` contains defects in both pleading and legal theory that constrain the court to dismiss many of the plaintiff's claims.'' The judge, however, refused to dismiss common-law claims against three white <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents _ <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Veach </PERSON> _ whom <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> said spearheaded harassment when he worked in that city. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> also refused to dismiss <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s claim that his civil rights were violated under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But he dismissed 21 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and top officials as defendants in that claim, saying only the attorney general could be sued as head of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s agency. He also found that many of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s claims against individual agents, particularly supervisors who allegedly ignored the racial harassment complaints, were pre-empted under other statutes by the Title VII claim. <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> chose to hail <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s decision to preserve the civil rights claim, saying it was the vehicle for the overall harassment and discrimination complaint. `` The individuals, at least temporarily, some of them, are off the hook, but the judge has clearly said the only problem is he does n't want Title VII and allegations about the individuals to be merged,'' <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said. `` That is just a matter of filing an amended complaint which separates them,'' he said. But <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> conceded he will have difficulty sustaining claims against the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> supervisors and managers that <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> claims deliberately ignored his complaints. <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said he was gratified by <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s stern warning to the defendants to stop referring to the racial harassment incidents as `` pranks.'' `` This utter lack of sensitivity is almost as disturbing as the alleged acts themselves,'' <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said, adding that `` the court hereby warns defendants that a modicum of decency is expected for all those who file pleadings in this court.'' <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said, `` The judge really recognized how inappropriate it has been for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and their lawyers to fail to acknowledge that something other than pranks occurred here.'' The judge also dismissed altogether complaints against three agents arising from alleged racial harassment incidents when <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> worked in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, field office in 1983 and 1984. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> found that the statute of limitations had expired on those claims. The <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> upheld many of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s complaints about harassment in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> incidents was suspended after the suit was filed <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, 38, now works in the bureau's <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who admitted during an internal investigation that he forged <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s signature on an application for `` death and dismemberment'' insurance, is the subject of a grand jury investigation. The insurance policy was sent to <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s home as part of what <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> called an attempt to get `` retribution'' for the black agent's complaints of racial harassment. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was suspended for two weeks without pay but fellow white agents took a collection to pay his salary, according to statements made in court.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators are trying to determine why a jetliner was flying at the wrong altitude over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and almost collided with another jetliner earlier this week. Word of the incident emerged Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it was investigating a report filed by one of the pilots, who estimated the two aircraft came within 200 to 300 feet of each other. The incident last Monday occurred about 700 miles east of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and involved <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 jetliners flown by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charter airline, and LuftTransport, a West German charter carrier, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reb </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> pilot, said he was talking to his co-pilot when he suddenly saw the other plane through a side window of the cockpit. He immediately lowered the nose of his plane and descended 1,000 feet, according to an airline spokesman. At the time, both jets were cruising at about 550 miles per hour at 35,000 feet with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 665 flying directly west and the LuftTransport Flight 410 heading southwest and converging, according to government and airline officials. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the LuftTransport plane should have been flying at 31,000 feet. Flight 665 with 250 passengers and 12 crew members was bound from <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Recker </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. It could not immediately be determined how many people were aboard the other plane, but such European charter flights normally are heavily booked during the summer months, according to aviation experts. The LuftTransport jet was bound from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The airspace over the ocean where the incident occurred is not covered by radar, but jetliners are assigned specific routes, speed and altitude by controllers at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, and at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the West German plane had just left airspace controlled by the Gander controllers and entered airspace controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> control center when the incident occurred. `` The -LRB- German -RRB- plane should have descended to 31,000 feet before it entered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airspace,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said preliminary reports indicate that both planes were flying the proper route but that `` it looks like a case of the wrong altitude'' on the part of the LuftTransport plane. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators planned to interview controllers at both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Gander to determine whether the LuftTransport pilot was assigned the wrong altitude. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said both pilots saw the other aircraft. `` It was close and it's kind of frightening,'' said <PERSON> Recker </PERSON>. He said no one aboard the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane was injured during the incident and that it was over before the passengers were aware of anything unusual. LuftTransport is based in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Lawmakers took several steps to fight the ocean dumping of medical waste before heading back to districts where waves of the infectious debris have marred the summer for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> resort towns and vacationers. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted Thursday to stiffen federal penalties for illegal dumping as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prepared to leave town for the August recess, and other lawmakers drafted separate measures to track hospital debris and make violators financially liable for lost revenue to coastal communities. Meanwhile, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> injected the topic into presidential politics, calling on Attorney General-designate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to determine if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can be used to strengthen government anti-pollution enforcement. `` Our ocean should not be a dumping ground,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called medical waste floating up on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> beaches a `` national disgrace'' and termed the situation `` dangerous,'' just two days after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` guidance and education'' _ not new rules on disposal of medical waste _ were the answer. <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials on Tuesday had told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that they believe the debris does not pose a major health threat. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on crime approved legislation that would create a specific federal law against medical waste dumping, carrying penalties up to five years in prison, $ 250,000 in fines and forfeiture of assets such as ships used in illegal dumping. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, the subcommittee chairman and sponsor of the bill, said current laws do not address medical waste dumping specifically and do not cover dumping in all circumstances. `` Even if they are apprehended, the current penalties amount to little more than a slap on the wrist,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore communities. `` By making illegal medical waste disposal a federal criminal offense, we will be raising the stakes considerably.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., who represents resort towns on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard and <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, introduced legislation similar to <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' bill, but also including a liability provision Under the <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> measure, state and local governments would be able to recover lost tax revenues from violators. In addition, coastal homeowners could recover for damaged property and fishermen and tourist-related businesses could recover for lost business due to medical waste. `` While the medical risk associated with this debris is fairly low, it is intolerable that garbage finds its way into the ocean and onto our shores,'' said <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and the environment. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., filed legislation calling for a manifest system to track medical waste produced in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week passed a similar pilot program proposal for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The federal government has no mandatory tracking system, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they will continue with voluntary efforts instead of imposing regulations. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denit </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of solid waste, said the agency would use `` education and guidance'' to discourage companies from dumping medical waste at sea.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comes to the Republican convention with more money than anticipated after rationing everything from plane travel to office supplies to keep from going over the federal cap on spending, his staff says. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't have to worry about paying for the multimillion-dollar Superdome convention, he does have to pay related campaign costs such as housing and staff payroll. To make those ends meet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been forced to keep a tight rein on campaign spending over the past few months to stay under the $ 23 million primary spending limit that is set for presidential campaigns. Candidates are allowed more than $ 4 million on top of that for fund-raising costs, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also raised and spent. Entering the last six weeks of the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began July with less than $ 1 million to go before hitting the limit. He has only to make it through his nomination Wednesday night to get $ 46 million from the federal treasury for his fall race against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Until then, his campaign is ruled by the primary limit. `` We've been penny-pinchers all along and we're very careful with our finances,' ` said finance spokeswoman Ede Holiday, who added, `` Obviously we are very close to our spending limit.'' She declined to say how close. Four Democratic state chairmen have accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of overspending the limit and filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week. Holiday said the campaign kept a tight budget that, as planned, will last just through the convention. `` We have plenty of money to do what we want to do at the convention,'' she said. Holiday would not say how much the campaign was spending for convention activity, but said the belt-tightening in recent weeks has left more money to spend on the convention than originally anticipated. One campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was well in excess of the $ 300,000 that Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff says he spent at the Democrats' convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month. Some of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff are working voluntarily until they go on the general election payroll after the nomination, said Holiday. Staff members have talked about having to scrimp on office supplies, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> restricted his travel sharply in the waning weeks of the campaign to keep from topping the limit. The lion's share of the extravaganza in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> _ including the convention itself, communications equipment and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> office space in the Superdome, and balloons and banners _ will be paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and to a lesser degree the local host committee. The Republicans, as the Democrats did in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, receive $ 9.2 million from the federal treasury to put on their conventions. The money comes from the same taxpayer-supported federal fund that doles out primary matching money to the candidates and gives each general election candidate $ 46 million. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, deputy convention manager for communications, said most of the money went into construction and logistics costs, while many of the decorations inside and outside the hall were paid for by the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts centered on promoting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> through such projects as decorating the airport, providing media kits about the area, and plastering the city with banners and billboards reading `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> to the Future and the 1988 Republican Convention,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hymel </PERSON>, executive director of the committee's media and hospitality effort.

<HEAD>NRA Attacks Congressional Backers of Handgun Waiting Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has served notice that even its strongest backers will feel its wrath if they support legislation to require a seven-day waiting period when buying a handgun. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> letters mailed across the country urge the gun lobby's supporters to pressure members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to defeat the measure But even conservative Republicans who call themselves <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters said Thursday that the mailings contain factual distortions, and some of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members are downright angry. `` They ought to stop beating up on their friends,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., who is undecided on the legislation `` They are really screwing up their credibility with people who supported them for a long, long time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> especially angered Rep. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., who said the organization's letter attacking him personally is `` downright erroneous, false and plays on hysteria in an attempt to get me to change my vote. <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> said he supports the waiting period and wo n't change his mind The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> official who signed the letters, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> was singled out because he wrote his constituents proclaiming his support for the right to keep and bear arms. `` You do n't have it both ways,'' said <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody knows this is a big gun vote. You're either for gun owners or against gun owners. `` If someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rights away ... we're going to fight back. That's what sportsmen and gun owners expect us to do.'' The waiting period measure, part of omnibus drug legislation that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will vote on in September, would require a seven-day wait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer. The dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a sworn statement that includes a description of the gun, the serial number, and the name, address and birth date of the buyer. Police may, but are not required to, conduct a background check. Purchasers who would be prohibited from buying handguns would be those already ineligible under existing federal law: convicted felons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, those adjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution, those dishonorably discharged from the military and people under indictment for a felony. Twenty-two states already have enacted a waiting period of varying duration. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> contends the waiting period would amount to a national registration of handguns, would cost `` hundreds of millions'' of dollars to enforce, and would require `` a bureaucrat's permission'' to buy a gun. Conservatives and liberals alike said all these assertions were wrong. But conservative <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members targeted for pressure said that perhaps the ultimate insult was the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to link them to liberals who support gun control. <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>'s constituents: `` I have in my hand a letter dated July 1988 from the <ORGANIZATION> Sensenbrenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Re-Election </ORGANIZATION> proclaiming his fight for gun owners' rights ... HA. With support like that, you might as well have <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> representing you.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., is one of the most liberal senators and is a strong supporter of handgun control While other versions of the letter do not attack individual lawmakers, they make the same points about the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> contended that backers of the bill `` want the police to visit your home before you can buy a firearm, yet police right now do n't have the resources to send cruisers to investigate residential burglaries in many areas.'' <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> defended the statement even though no such language is in the bill. He said it was a response to statements made by backers of the legislation that police would drive by homes to check addresses on a gun purchaser's forms. Responding to a criticism of <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> supported waiting periods in the early 1970s, but changed its mind a few years later when it found `` they do n't stop crime. It's simply red tape for honest people.'' Other lawmakers angered by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign included Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lungren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., a <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who has backed past <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> positions; and Rep. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., who considers himself a strong supporter of the right to own <PERSON> Lungren </PERSON> called the attack on <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> `` a pretty desperate letter against one of their supporters.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> said, `` I am shocked and disappointed at the excessive language and tactics used by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> in the letter to my constituents.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> locked horns at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dinner party after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was `` surprised and hurt'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called for a special prosecutor to investigate ethics charges against him. Aides to the two officials described the Wednesday night episode after insisting on anonymity. They said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted by complaining about the Democratic convention, where speakers referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a toothache of a man'' and taunted `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' in suggesting he was an invisible vice president. The aides provided differing descriptions of the intensity of the exchange, which occurred at the annual House Gym Dinner given for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who use the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> athletic facilities. `` It was a polite, private discussion, not a heated exchange, no profanities,'' said the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> aide. In contrast, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide said: `` It was quite a heated exchange with a lot of witnesses. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> started screaming and yelling that he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- had impugned his -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s -RRB- integrity.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used profanities. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday, but not to apologize, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s aide said The aide said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` reassured him there was no personal animosity of any sort,'' and the two agreed they could `` make contributions by maintaining a high standard in their personal relationship.'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, the campaign press secretary to the vice president, said, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told me this morning, ` If you get any calls, you can be authorized to say that I talked to the speaker this morning and I appreciated his call.''' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have known each other since the 1960s, when they served together in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as junior congressmen from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s aide said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approached the speaker at the dinner and asked how he was doing. The speaker said he was disappointed in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for calling for a special prosecutor to investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on ethical issues, particularly the financial arrangements involving the publication of a book by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and reports that the speaker had tried to get special treatment for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bankers. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s actions are being investigated by a special counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s aide said the speaker has `` always enjoyed a personal rapport with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' and has never had any personal harsh feelings toward him. `` On a number of occasions, including one with the press, he had defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from what <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> considered unwarranted attacks and bum attacks.'' He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in front of reporters defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from charges of being a wimp, and the next week <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the special prosecutor and `` came out with his attacks on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' `` Last night, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> reminded him of his defenses of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that should <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> be elected president, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would be speaker, and the two would have to work together,'' the aide said. `` <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> never engaged in any personal attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -LRB- and he -RRB- was surprised and hurt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gratuitously had gone out of his way to attack <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> personally. `` He said he had no personal hostility toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He was glad he had spoken to him. That's what a friend should do if he felt that another friend had let him down or done him injury.''

 Those who follow the rapidly moving events are uncertain of the outcome in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, where unarmed citizens are angry enough to confront rifles and the government is willing to shoot them down. Diplomats and other observers sketch a variety of finales to the drama that began with President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s accession to power late last month and has progressed through increasing levels of popular protest and violence. Security forces initially were restrained and disciplined, but soldiers opened fire Tuesday on thousands of demonstrators in the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Official reports say protest has spread to virtually every town and city in the the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation of 38 million people. High school students in their mid-teens were the vanguard but witnesses say <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, workers and ordinary townspeople have joined the mass denunciation of 26 years of authoritarian rule and economic deprivation. These are some of the results foreseen by diplomats in scenarios by diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>: _ Continued ruthless suppression of all protest by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and a loyal army until all opponents are rooted out or cowed into the passivity that characterized the political scene until recent events. _ The ouster of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> by former strongman <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who overthrew the democracy in 1962. He formally retired from political life last month, but some believe he still pulls the strings. _ An intensified and bloody uprising that would compel the army, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful institution, to overthrow the government and install a more moderate leadership. Unlike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where mass popular protest achieved greater political freedom, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has no prominent personalities advocating democracy who could lead the growing but diffuse opposition. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, the most outspoken critic of the system, is 70 and retired from politics after falling out with Ne Win in the early 1960s. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> has jailed the former army officer, a relative liberal. Protesters seem to illustrate this dearth of political alternatives by resurrecting old symbols and the images of leaders long dead. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> marchers carry portraits of <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, the dashing fighter for <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence who was assassinated in 1947, and wave the peacock flag of days when <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> struggled against its British colonial masters. Like the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has a strong military in which increasing disaffection is reported. Some diplomats speculate that elements of the army, as in the `` people power'' revolution that ousted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, could provide the muscle to bring down <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general. The military has been <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s privileged class since Ne Win seized power, however. Retired or active military officers currently hold all but two Cabinet positions, and even the rank and file has privileges civilians do not enjoy. Ne Win assiduously built, or bought, the loyalty of a generation and more of army officers. Although his proclaimed ideology has been a mix of socialist economics, Buddhism and isolationism, political control has rested with the military and the army-dominated government political party. `` I find it hard to believe such a man steeped in power since 1962 giving it all up in one fell swoop. Something smells here,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat based in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> who spoke on the condition he not be identified. He added, however, that if <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> returned the question remained whether the people now would accept `` the lesser of two evils'' even if he pursued urgently needed economic reforms. Some protesters still call the government the `` Ne Win regime'' and demand restoration of democracy. Marchers applauded loudly this week when passing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Others say they are fighting for socialism minus <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who is widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent since the 1960s. `` The young people have n't known anything in their lives but this system,'' a Burmese intellectual said recently. `` They do n't know exactly what they want or how to get it. Many Westerners arriving from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say Burmese from many walks seem certain of one thing: They have had enough of leaders who provide neither freedom nor rice.

JOB HISTORY: He was appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in 1969. As a prosecutor, his targets included a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs agent, a county sheriff and a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalley </PERSON>, who was convicted in a kickback case. In 1975, he was appointed by President Ford as assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division. In 1978, the Republican <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> defeated former <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> for governor. He ran on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the Democratic administration of then-Gov. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapp </PERSON>, a Democrat. He was re-elected in 1982, narrowly defeating former congressman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ertel </PERSON> during a recession that made it difficult for incumbent <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates. Barred by law from seeking a third term, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> at the end of 1986 to head the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>.

He championed a controversial welfare reform law that limited cash benefits to three months a year for an estimated 68,000 people considered `` able-bodied.'' A sampling of his positions: _ On abortion, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has a mixed record In December 1981, he vetoed an Abortion Control Act, saying he objected to sections that said life started at conception, that mandated a 24-hour waiting period, and that would have established criminal penalties for doctors who broke the law. On June 11, 1982, however, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> signed a watered-down version of the abortion bill, which required doctors to notify women about the risks of abortion and the availability of medical assistance for prenatal care and childbirth. Portions of the law were later struck down by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. _ On capital punishment, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said during both terms in office that he favored the death penalty for certain murders and for persons convicted of killing police officers and prison guards During his first term, the death penalty was reinstated in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. During his second term, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> signed warrants setting execution dates for several convicted murderers. Appeals courts granted stays in each case. _ On gun control, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said while campaigning for his first term that he opposed further government regulation of the sale or purchase of firearms Subsequent public statements on this issue could not be found. While governor, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> signed a bill setting a mandatory five-year sentence for any person convicted of using a gun during a crime.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dawn of peace in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war is likely to be a sunset for the hopes of rebels in each country, diplomats say. The cease-fire announced Monday may close crucial border sanctuaries used by the Kurdish rebels fighting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the leftist peoples' Mujahedeen seeking to topple <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. That can only be bad news for Kurdish rebel leader <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, who declared in an April interview with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> magazine: `` We can no longer live with -LRB- <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President -RRB- <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in the same country ... now it's either him or us.'' The cease-fire will take effect Aug. 20, and 350 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers are to be in place along the 730-mile border within a week. That gives both countries a chance to concentrate on eliminating their rebels. `` I do n't think the Iraqis are going to be anything other than merciless'' toward the Kurdish rebels, said a Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, fighting for a Kurdish republic, scored a series of military successes against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> late last year in alliance with Iranian forces. But their fortunes faded as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s army appeared to crumble this year, and diplomats say <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> largely has squashed the Kurdish forces. Witnesses said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has tried to rob the rebels of base areas by bulldozing dozens of villages in mountainous northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where about 2.5 million Kurds live. `` It's just one destroyed village after another,'' said a diplomat who has toured the area. Kurds from different villages have been moved to newly built towns of gray concrete houses _ breaking the tight social solidarity of village life that rebels often used for protection. `` Kurds will continue to be Kurds ... but the village way of life is a thing of the past,'' said the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, who spoke on condition of not being identified further. A 1975 Iraq-Iran treaty closed the border to rebels in each country, helping quell Kurdish dissidence at that time. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s later support of Kurdish guerrilla action was one of the fuses that led to full explosion of the war in September 1980 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the past also supported Kurdish dissidents inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but its main aid during the war went to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, which moved to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after its leaders were expelled from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986. The Mujahedeen-led <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> made a series of raids into Iranian territory this year. The latest drove 60 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and briefly captured two cities. Military observers said there is evidence that Iraqi forces aided the Iranian rebel operations, an allegation <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the rebels denied. But a well-placed Iraqi source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his government would almost surely block the border to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> as part of any cease-fire. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> being based in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> does have a lot to do with the conflict,'' he noted. `` No doubt any peace settlement will mean the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> wo n't operate from Iraqi soil,'' said a European diplomat. <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zada </PERSON> refused to say whether the organization would move its battle entirely within <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But he insisted that closing the border would not stop the rebellion against <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` We have tremendous support inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That would be no problem.''

 Soviets are caught in a paper chase brought on by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. They ca n't get their fill of glasnost-inspired writing for the same reason they ca n't get enough toilet paper: a paper shortage In a country where people read voraciously, the problem is more than just another wrinkle in daily life. It means some people could miss vigorous debates in the state-run press about the country's history and about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging social and economic reforms Thousands have left post offices empty-handed after trying to apply for their favorite newspaper and magazine subscriptions. They have been waging a paper war against the problem, deluging newspapers with letters of protest. `` It's understandable that we constantly have a paper deficit, but in our time of revolutionary renewal, the thoughts and feelings by which the country is living is concentrated in the newspapers and magazines. Therefore, it would n't be awful to sacrifice the circulation of other publications. Society would be generously repaid,'' <PERSON> Muscovite </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulgin </PERSON> wrote in a letter published Aug. 6 in the cultural daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION>. Since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985 and encouraged more open discussion of the country's problems and history, citizens have been snapping up periodicals like <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News that are at the forefront of the new openness, or glasnost. Such periodicals quickly sell out at newsstands, and subscriptions are hard to come by. Last year, Soviets rejoiced when it was announced that applications for 1989 subscriptions for the state-run press would be accepted throughout 1988. In previous years, orders were taken only after Aug. 1. But the jubilation was premature. The sad tale of would-be subscribers has been unfolding the past two weeks in the Soviet press. When Jan. 1 rolled around, Soviets were told they could only sign up for newspapers and had to wait until August for magazine subscriptions. But on July 20, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> issued what has now become an infamous order. Directive No. 315, in effect, limited the number of 1989 subscriptions to their 1988 level. Further restrictions apply to 41 publications, including such popular sellers as <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, Soviet Sport and <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>. The sky's the limit, however, for the more conventional _ some Soviets would say boring _ publications like <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The problem extends to books. Authors complain that because of the paper shortage, they have to wait years for their works to be published. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> complained Aug. 1 that Soviet publishers waste limited paper and printing facilities producing huge stacks of political tomes and brochures that few people want to read. Faced with the public outcry over limits on subscriptions, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> has been put on the defensive. Two of its top officials have appeared _ in print _ explaining the restrictions and complaining that they ca n't keep up with demand. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudryavtsev </PERSON>, first deputy minister of communications, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency published Thursday that since 1985, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power, magazine and newspaper circulation has increased annually by 20 million copies. The average Soviet family receives seven publications, he said. <PERSON> Kudryavtsev </PERSON> said the new restrictions became necessary only because of the `` subscription boom'' and paper shortage. He said paper production had dropped in part because mills are big polluters, and the government is paying more attention to preserving the environment under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership. He suggested people consider sharing, or as he put it, `` collective subscriptions.''

<TEXT>
 A woman who was once <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s lowest-paid teacher is giving up a higher-paying job in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to reopen the one-room schoolhouse where she taught for 16 years, and some parents and children could n't be happier. `` It keeps the community going. We do n't want to be dying out here,'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sveum </PERSON>, whose two children will attend the grammar school, said Thursday. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON>, 54, took a job teaching toddlers in <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, after the school closed in 1986. The school board decided it was not practical to keep the building open for the rural district's one remaining pupil. With five children through grade 6 living in the district now, Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON> _ the school's lone teacher for 16 years _ will be back when classes begin anew Aug. 29. `` The whole community feels that something is back to life. It's exciting for all of us,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON> said she was happy teaching in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but that she considers her home to be <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, a community of 45 people set in wide-open cattle country. She maintains a home here and is part owner of the Sand Dune Saloon. Mrs. <PERSON> Sveum </PERSON> said her daughters, first-grader <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> and kindergartener <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, no longer will have to endure a 45-minute bus ride to a school in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, about 25 miles away, and will benefit from a one-on-one relationship with the teacher. `` They're very much looking forward to it,'' she said. `` They went up while we were cleaning the school and they were playing school themselves, writing on the chalkboard.'' Five years ago at <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON> earned the dubious distinction of being the lowest-paid teacher in the nation with a $ 6,300 salary. The salary had increased to $ 6,800 when the school closed, but her <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> job paid $ 25,000. Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON> said she did not know how much she would be paid here but that it will be a substantial pay cut from her <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> job. <PERSON> Ilef </PERSON> <PERSON> Olerud </PERSON>, school board president, said the board was still negotiating a contract. `` It does n't cost me anything to live here in comparison to down there -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON>. `` It does n't even out. But it's not a drastic difference.'' Ms. <PERSON> Herbranson </PERSON> said she believes the <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> school has a bright future. With several pre-school children in the district, enrollment is expected to grow, she said. She said the reopening is a victory of sorts for rural one-room schoolhouses. `` It's a good type of education, there's no doubt in my mind,'' she said.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> says he hopes an independence referendum can be held in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> this year and offered detailed proposals to end the guerrilla war there. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief urged <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario pro-independence movement to respond to his proposals by Sept. 1. Details of the ideas were not released. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> has occupied the territory since the Spanish colonial administration withdrew from what had been the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> protectorate in 1975. Fighting with the Marxist-led Polisario movement began soon after. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> jointly ran the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> withdrew from the conflict in 1979. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s battle with <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> has engaged most of its 100,000-man army and has cost <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> up to $ 2 million a day. Nearly 10,000 people have been killed in the war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> presented his proposals for organizing a cease-fire and a referendum on Thursday to representatives of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and Polisario, and to the Organization of African Unity, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. He said details are being kept confidential, but added that the `` rather long document'' was the result of extensive discussions among the parties, so `` they wo n't be extremely surprised'' by his suggestions. `` The current chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> and I have carried out a number of consultations with the parties to the conflict in order to find the means to bring about practical conditions which would allow the people of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> to freely exercise their right to self-determination through a credible referendum, and without military or administrative constraints,'' said the secretary-general. Asked if the referendum will be held this year, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> replied: `` That is our hope.'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> made little effort to develop the 110,000-square-mile wilderness, about the size of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. It is rich in phosphates and possibly potash and iron ore but had a population of only about 75,000 when <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> pulled out. Polisario claims to have 16,000 heavily armed guerrillas operating in the desert. Moroccan officers estimate guerrilla strength at fewer than 4,000.

The winner was Turbo Pig, whose time of 3.9 seconds shaved more than a second off the 2.7-second mark set last year by Squealing Demon. Three hogs painted with orange, green and blue racing stripes competed in the first of nine heats Thursday. It was a close race until <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Slop </PERSON> <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> collided halfway down the 50-foot track. Seizing the opportunity, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Clipper </PERSON> won it by a snout, clocking in at 4.4 seconds. Other first-round winners were eventual champ Turbo Pig, Boaring Down, Fried Bacon, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charlie </LOCATION>, Burning Buns, Crisp Cutlet, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Swine </PERSON> and Bugsy. Second-round eliminations narrowed the field to Boaring Down, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charlie </LOCATION>, Burning Buns and Turbo Pig. As anticipation grew and verbal bets were placed, <PERSON> Turbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pig </PERSON> broke loose from the starting gate and headed for the feed trough. Race action was stalled until five officials cornered the pig and corralled him into the starting gate. With all four pigs in place, the starting bell sounded. Burning Buns took the early lead but squealed and slowed down as Boaring Down darted in front of him. New Deal <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> ran to the outside and stopped for a fraction of a second to check out the crowd. <PERSON> Turbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pig </PERSON> took advantage of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s curiosity, crossing the finish line to claim first place. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbkersman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who won $ 234 for Turbo Pig's performance, said she does n't do anything special to prepare her hog for race day `` He's just a really fast pig,'' she said. `` I give him really good feed, but I do n't train him much.''

<HEAD>U.S. Team Caught Trying To Ship Prohibited Soviet Military
Materials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has lodged a formal diplomatic protest about members of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team who attempted to ship sensitive materials from a nuclear test site in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The shipment, seized by Soviet authorities on July 17, involved tools and wire associated with Soviet nuclear test preparations and soil and rock samples which could be used in assessing yields of nuclear blasts, the report said. The team members were not identified. The project in question was part of the Joint Verification Experiment concerning nuclear testing and `` has nothing to do with on site inspection or the INF -LRB- intermediate-range nuclear force -RRB- treaty,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The story quoted <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, assistant to the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the Military Liasion to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the incident was `` absolutely not'' a deliberate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to collect prohibited materials. Contacted by telephone Thursday night, <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> initially denied making the printed comments, saying `` that is absolutely wrong _ I never said anything like that at all.'' Asked if he had not spoken to the newspaper, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official abruptly said `` no comment.'' Questioned further about details in the report, <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> again responded `` no comment _ good night.'' He refused to answer questions involving the Soviet-U.S. experiment. The Post described <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as `` key participant in negotaitions leading to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. visit.''. The project was the first time the two nations had begun to allow the other to observe and closely monitor their nuclear blasts. The experiment is expected to lead to adoption of on-site inspection measures to supplement traditional long-distance surveillance by seismic and statellite sensors. The shipment in question was discovered when Soviet officials searched a a crate of personal belongings of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official and two employees of private companies under contract to the federal government, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The agreement, which was drawn up in June, mandated tht none of the hand tools, wire, soil samples, rocks and other materials discoverd in the crate could be legally removed from the testing area, the paper said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and other unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were quoted in the report as maintaining that the incident, which prompted the Soviet protest to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats on July 25, was `` an honest misunderstanding.'' Although the Soviets demanded permanent expulsion of three team members who had already left the country, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was able to obtain permission for one of the employees, who was not responsible for the attempt, to remain. The Post quoted unnamed senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying the incident was not expected to halt the progress of the experiment, which calls for observation of tests at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> site in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and a special esperiment at the Soviet Semipalatinsk site. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the incident, the report said.

 Actress <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says anger helped her recover from a car accident that nearly killed her shortly after the success of the movie `` Private Benjamin,'' in which she starred with Goldie Hawn. `` I was no saint,'' she says in September's Ladies Home Journal. `` I was angry, and anger is a powerful emotion. It increased my determination not to go under, to get well.'' The accident six years ago left her legs smashed, the bones on the left side of her face broken, and her left eye socket shattered.

<TEXT>
 Most doctors are not using clot-dissolving drugs to treat heart attack victims, even though studies suggest such treatment along with aspirin can dramatically reduce heart attack deaths, say participants in the latest study. `` Our object is to get the results of this treatment widely known so people will get this treatment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sleight </PERSON>, chairman of the new study's steering committee. On Thursday, Sleight and his colleagues reported that giving an aspirin and a clot-dissolving drug within 24 hours of the onset of a heart attack can reduce the death rate over the following five weeks from 13 percent to 8 percent. This should now be considered standard treatment, the doctors said. But `` at the moment, most patients in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do n't have blood-clot dissolving treatment of any type,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peto </PERSON>, one of the researchers `` I've never seen a trial that produced results as striking as these ones,'' he said. <PERSON> Peto </PERSON> said the treatment could save the lives of 25,000 of the 500,000 Americans who have heart attacks each year if they all received it. It costs about $ 150 and can be done at any community hospital or even by a doctor outside a hospital, the researchers said. <PERSON> Peto </PERSON> and other study participants spoke at a press conference held in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in conjunction with publication of the latest findings in the forthcoming issue of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancet </ORGANIZATION>, a British medical journal. The results were widely publicized in March at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The researchers studied 17,187 patients at 417 hospitals around the world. Some patients were given aspirin, and some the clot-dissolving drug streptokinase. Another group was given both, and a control group was given neither. The death rate up to five weeks after a heart attack was 13 percent in the untreated control group. It dropped to about 10 -LCB- percent in the patients given either aspirin or streptokinase, and it dropped to 8 percent in patients given both drugs, <PERSON> Peto </PERSON> said. Furthermore, the study showed that the drugs reduced deaths in elderly patients, who were previously not thought suitable for clot-dissolving treatment because doctors thought it might increase their risk of strokes, <PERSON> Peto </PERSON> said. It also showed that the drugs were helpful even if given as late as 24 hours after the onset of chest pains, <PERSON> Peto </PERSON> said. Streptokinase is derived from streptococcus bacteria, which cause strep throat. Most heart attacks are caused by a clot blocking the coronary arteries, which provide a nourishing blood supply to the heart muscle. Streptokinase dissolves the clots and aspirin helps to prevent the clotting of blood cells called platelets, thus helping to prevent reformation of clots, the researchers said. The researchers found no increase in the rate of strokes following the treatment. Streptokinase caused potentially hazardous low blood pressure in 8 out of 100 patients, but `` this can be easily dealt with provided doctors and nurses are aware that it can occur,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, another study participant. The study, called the second International Study of Infarct Survival, or <ORGANIZATION> ISIS </ORGANIZATION>, will be followed by a third <ORGANIZATION> ISIS </ORGANIZATION> study intended to compare the effectiveness of streptokinase with other clot-dissolving drugs. The most widely publicized of the alternative drugs is tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which is produced by genetic engineering and costs some $ 2,000 per treatment, compared to the $ 150 cost of streptokinase. Current data does not allow a direct comparison of the effectiveness of the two drugs, the researchers said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, a biochemist and securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Vector </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said that the dramatic success of streptokinase would likely force down the price of TPA.

 Republican lawmakers say they expect President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign legislation that rushes $ 672 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the federal prison system and an assortment of other programs said to need the money. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the supplemental spending bill by a 270-32 tally late Thursday, then sent the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where it passed on a voice vote and was sent to the White House. Lawmakers prided themselves on fighting off temptation and refraining from the frequent practice of attaching pet projects to the measure, saying they abided by a pact congressional leaders reached with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last fall. The legislation was labeled a `` dire emergency'' bill because the measure was supposed to be limited to that type of spending. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said it was `` a very stringently conceived bill that is absolutely required for the continuation of many essential services. The $ 672 million bill was a compromise between a $ 189 million measure approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on July 27 and a $ 633 million version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. The bill is for the 1988 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition to the fresh money, the bill would allow $ 200 million to be transferred among the budgets of various agencies. Eyeing a nearly month-long recess that began at the close of the day's business, conference committee members worked out the compromise and rushed the bill through final approval in both houses in a single day. The few objections in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> came from legislators who complained this measure was no different from other spending bills. `` This is no emergency,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. As often happens with spending bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the deal was reached by each chamber agreeing to most of what the other had proposed, rather than mutually chopping away at each other's sought-after Thus, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> accepted <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provisions that would give the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> $ 530 million in new spending to help pay for an increase in some benefits, a burgeoning caseload and medical care. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also had sought $ 23 million to help the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> keep an eye on Soviet inspectors monitoring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> compliance with the new nuclear arms treaty. The final bill contained $ 14 million of that amount. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consented to spending $ 15 million for state unemployment programs _ the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had wanted $ 50 million _ and $ 24 million the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wanted so the government can process refugees from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere. In addition, the measure bore $ 75 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, mostly for expenses arising from last year's rioting by Cuban detainees in prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. It also had $ 60 million to help the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> keep its patrols going; $ 55 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pay for some drought costs; $ 49 million for benefits to people who lose their jobs because of foreign competition, and $ 43 million for payments to people with black lung disease.

 The world's second-largest convenience store chain says it will postpone a plan to deny medical benefits to employees with ailments related to drugs, alcohol or AIDS because of a `` general misunderstanding'' of the policy. Adopted in January by Circle K stores, the policy met with a storm of protest when it was publicly disclosed last week. The company said it would no longer pay for employees' medical care for illnesses resulting from `` personal lifestyle decisions,'' including the use of alcohol or drugs, self-inflicted injury, or infection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome through any means other than blood transfusions. The policy applied to about 3,000 Circle K employees hired since Jan. 1. The company said no employee has been denied coverage so far as a result of it. Since the company is self-insured, its health care plan is not covered by state regulations banning such restrictions. Most health insurance policies exclude coverage for suicide attempts but cover claims related to AIDS and substance abuse. The Phoenix-based company has about 26,000 employees at more than 4,000 stores in 27 states. It also has about 800 other stores in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. It had sales of about $ 2 billion last year. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eller </PERSON>, Circle K Corps.'s chairman and chief executive officer, announced Thursday that the plan's implementation would be delayed while it was reviewed by company officials. `` A general misunderstanding of the policy has arisen and that needs to be clarified,'' <PERSON> Eller </PERSON> said. `` We were and still are extremely concerned about containing costs of medical insurance for employees.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> gay-rights activist, met with company officials Wednesday in an attempt to negotiate a change in the policy. He called the announcement `` an excellent, excellent signal.'' Buck said he and Circle K officials agreed on four points: _ There are ambiguities in the corporation's health-benefits policy _ The intention of the policy, which is to cut the cost of health insurance, `` is legitimate and well-meaning. _ The policy is open to review and possible revision _ The company and the gay-rights activists will meet again Monday <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a Circle K senior vice president, said the company agreed that clarification of the policy was needed but noted the agreement was to review the policy, not cancel it. `` I do n't feel we're conceding anything at this point,'' he said. Buck, who gained prominence by directing the 1987 campaign to recall then-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, said the primary problem with the policy was that the company became the judge of its employees' lifestyles `` That creates two problems,'' Buck said. `` One is that the employee does n't know whether he is covered in any given instance. The second is that it creates an administrative nightmare for the company in deciding on a case-by-case basis what claims it will pay for.'' Buck said some gay activists favored picketing and boycotts of Circle K stores, but he counseled against it. `` I think that they -LRB- Circle K -RRB- are willing and anxious to open good-faith negotiations,'' <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. `` I told them that this is an emotional issue and they -LRB- the gay community -RRB- are reacting emotionally,'' he said. `` I told the other side that they must recognize the company's goal of cost-containment is legitimate, but the policy became confused, muddled and misdirected.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Waldheim Named Allied Prisoner Saboteur, Who Was

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> says Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, while an officer in the German army during World War II, caused the execution of a British prisoner who led an Allied escape attempt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, said Thursday that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> should be tried on war crimes charges. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> member told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that he based his accusations on a British historian's claims that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> signed a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> army intelligence report labeling British army Capt <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> a saboteur. The action constituted a virtual death sentence for <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, because <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> issued a standing order to execute Allied commandos linked to sabotage, said <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. `` We're talking about murder _ cold-blooded murder of a prisoner of war, and that is a war crime,'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` It did n't happen in the heat of battle It was a cold-blooded criminal act.'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> headed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s private office from 1973-76 when <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, elected president two years ago, served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any role in executing Allied prisoners when he served as an intelligence lieutenant for Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION>, which committed many atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, should be prosecuted. `` I would n't particularly worry about a lower-ranking person, but <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was a former secretary-general to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and is now head of state in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. In March 1986, it was revealed that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> from 1942 to 1945 after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops took control of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> of massacres of <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> and Greek civilians and partisans, as well as deportation of Greek Jews to Nazi death camps. He was also accused of involvement in a slaughter of about 70,000 people at the Yugoslav town of <LOCATION> Kozarra </LOCATION> in 1942. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied these accusations. Even so, the debate over his war past has badly marred relations between <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and frayed <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as well. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 placed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on its list of aliens prohibited from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Australian-born <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> belonged to the clandestine Special Operations Executive but wore his regular army uniform while leading an escape attempt of Allied prisoners of war across <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. The uniform entitled the captured officer to be treated as an ordinary POW, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. But he charged that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> interrogated the prisoner and signed the report declaring him a saboteur. A firing squad executed <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> on May 15, 1944. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said his charges stem from conversations with <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Montague </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>, a historian and former member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who ran Allied operations in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> from 1943 to 1945. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>'s report on <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> is to be published later this month in Encounter magazine. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON> has refused to talk to the press. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he has not read the report but discussed its contents with <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>, 71, now a professor of Greek studies at <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s largest opposition organization called for a demonstration Sept. 4 to demand a `` national salvation government'' and protest a recent crackdown by the leftist government. <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the demonstration will take place in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s downtown Plaza of the Revolution.

 Despite greater awareness of exercise and healthy foods, many Americans remain `` significantly overweight,'' according to federal researchers who say most government nutritional goals are unlikely to be met. `` Everybody knows what is required to lose weight, yet the prevalence of overweight does n't seem to change much,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, in its weekly report Thursday, reviewed the progress toward the government's 15 top-priority goals for American nutrition in 1990, including raising public knowledge of the effects of salt and lowering average blood-cholesterol levels. `` Substantial progress'' has been made in several areas, and three of the goals will be fully met, researchers said. But despite the progress, Americans will probably fall short of eight major goals, including that of getting people to lose weight, said Ms. <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON>, whose office helped prepare the report. `` The research that relates -LRB- poor -RRB- diet to disease is now incontrovertible,'' she said. `` It's really time now to start looking at ways to implement the recommendations that everybody is familiar with _ ways to improve the nutritional status of the population.'' The goals that will likely not be met, she said, are: _ Having less than 10 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men and 17 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women over the `` significantly overweight'' level, defined as more than 20 percent over desired weight. `` There's just been little change on that through the years,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON> said. `` It's still about one-fourth of the country.'' _ Having 50 percent of the overweight population on a weight-loss program combining diet and exercise. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said recent surveys show half the nation's overweight people are indeed trying to lose weight _ but only half are using both diet and exercise. _ Cutting the average adult level of harmful serum cholesterol below the 200 count. In a 1976-80 survey, average cholesterol levels were 211 for women and 215 for men, down from 214 and 217 in 1971-74. `` That rate of decline is not as fast as it should be,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON> said. _ Having at least three-fourths of all mothers breast-feeding their babies at the time they leave the hospital. A 1984 survey put the figure at 61 percent, up from 45 percent in 1978. _ Having all packaged foods labeled with `` useful calorie and nutrient information.'' Such is the case in 55 percent of packaged foods, up from 42 percent in 1978, Ms. <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON> said. _ Including nutrition counseling in `` virtually all routine health contacts with health professionals.'' A 1985 survey showed the figure at less than 30 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted. _ Elimination of cases where a child's growth is retarded because of nutritional deficiencies. Although the problem can not be precisely measured, it persists, Ms. <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON> said. _ Including nutrition education in the required school curriculum in all states. By 1985, only 12 states had such a requirement, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The three objectives that researchers think will be fully met, she said, are: _ Having more than 75 percent of the population aware of nutritional risks for conditions such as heart disease and high blood pressure -LRB- fats and salt -RRB- and tooth decay -LRB- between-meal sweets -RRB-. Awareness already runs as high as 90 percent in some categories, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report said. _ Having 90 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults aware that to lose weight they must eat fewer calories or increase physical activity, or both. The percentage was 73 in 1985 and is rising quickly, Ms. <PERSON> Nestle </PERSON> said. _ Implementation of a comprehensive national nutrition status monitoring system. It is already in place, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who lost his bid to become <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s president, accused two election officials of manipulating vote results and asked the government to file charges against them. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> claims he won the July 6 vote, but results released by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, 31.12 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, received 50.36 percent, the commission said. The Chamber of Deputies, sitting as the electoral college, meets Aug. 15-31 to review the results and formally declare a winner in the July 6 election. On Thursday, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> asked the Federal Attorney General's office to file criminal charges against commission president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and technical secretary <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calles </PERSON> for `` hiding information on the electoral results'' from nearly half of the nation's approximately 55,000 voting stations <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> also is Interior Minister. The petition said the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to release a breakdown of results from 24,642 polling places within four days of the election was a `` flagrant violation'' of the federal electoral code. A statement issued by the Front said the commission's failure to release the results made it impossible for opposition candidates to log formal complaints of voting irregularities in those local districts. The attorney general first must find cause for opening an investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted, said <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>, a spokeswoman with the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which belongs to the Front. On Aug. 4, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> renewed their charges of widespread fraud and called for new elections if their demands to clarify results were not met. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> candidate, has said the elections were so tainted by fraud it is difficult to determine who won. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> received 17.07 percent of the vote, according to official results. Both <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> have announced protests for Sunday evening, the night before the electoral college goes into session. Meanwhile, the ruling party announced Thursday night it will hold a series of nationwide rallies on Friday to defend <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' victory as part of a `` Popular Day of National Victory. The rallies of party supporters are being held `` to recognize the validity of the vote and the defense of the same,'' a party statement said.

Gen. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, a former intelligence officer, told foreign reporters at a government-sponsored briefing. `` The gulf war appears to be ending, and I do n't add ` Thank God' ... <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will have to think about it and start preparing,'' said <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said any future war between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` will be much more costly, more bloody, than it has been in the past'' because <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> has significantly improved the quantity and quality of its military equipment. He noted <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> recently had developed chemical warheads for its surface-to-surface missiles. Also, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had doubled its number of ground forces from five to 10 divisions and increased the number of tanks from 1,700 to 4,000 since the 1973 <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> war, he said. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> also has obtained advanced weaponry from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and more than doubled the number of attack aircraft in its arsenal, <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said. He refused to give a figure. On the other hand, he said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military expenditures had forced it to cut back on the size and training of its ground forces.

 A couple whose intentional disappearance froma college campus touched off a four-month nationwide search say they're tired of media attention and just want to resume their lives. `` We just to want to let it lay,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, in an interview published Thursday in The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. `` We just want to get back to our normal lives.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> and his new wife, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, fled the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in April.

The earthquake struck at about 2:15 p.m. and registered 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The quake was centered in southern <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> prefecture, about 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said residents of <LOCATION> Tateyama </LOCATION>, near the epicenter, ran from buildings when the rumbling began.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, reacting to the Pentagon bribery investigation, placed new restrictions on defense consultants as it approved a $ 282 billion military budget bill designed to win President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval. If the proposal becomes law, consultants will be required, for the first time, to spell out who hires them and whether they have potential conflicts of interests. `` The sad fact is that there is nothing requiring consultants under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to disclose conflicts of interest,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., one of the co-sponsors of the proposal approved Thursday The amendment was adopted on a voice vote shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the $ 282 billion bill on a 90-4 vote. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s proposal arose in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bribery case, which involves allegations that private consultants, many of them former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employes, paid current <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees for inside details about future contracts. No charges have yet been filed. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., a co-sponsor of the proposal, said the registration is needed because `` we need some mechanism for finding out who these people are working for and whether they're working both sides of the street. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., agreed, saying, `` This is an increasingly large problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also added an amendment intended to send a message to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that they should do more to pay for allied defense. The votes came shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill and followed by one week <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the first congressional attempt to pass a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed that bill because he did n't like its restrictions on arms control policy or its deep cuts into his proposal for Star Wars spending. The measure passed Thursday includes the Star Wars reductions, but none of the arms control limitations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rejected the bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, which is the first half of the congressional budget process. A second measure is needed to appropriate money for the authorized projects, and Thursday's bill was the appropriation measure. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns after Labor Day from its recess, a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> will meet to resolve differences between the measures approved by each chamber. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved its defense appropriation bill two months ago and it does n't contain either of the amendments approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Although both chambers are controlled by Democrats, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military budget generally fared better in the House than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s `` burden-sharing'' amendment orders a major review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overseas commitments, limits the deployment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and sets a limit on spending for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel stationed overseas. The last provision requires the allies to pay the difference if deployment costs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops rise above 1988 levels. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected, 59-36, another provision which proposed a 10 percent reduction in the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents living overseas. In the past year, both Democrats and Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies should pay more for allied defenses. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in particular, has been a prime target of such criticism. Voting against the spending bill were Sens. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Israeli soldiers opened fire today on three Palestinians who attacked them with chains, clubs and an ax in a pre-dawn fight, the army said. One Palestinian was killed and another was wounded in the leg. The clash took place shortly after midnight at the Mughazi refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said an army spokesman who was not identified in keeping with military regulations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio identified the dead man as <PERSON> Riad </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandil </PERSON>, 23. Army officials said he had participated in anti-Israeli demonstrations and attacks on soldiers in the past. Israeli sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the man ran from the army patrol after being wounded and may have bled to death. An autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death. The third member of the Palestinian group was arrested, said the sources. They suggested the group may have been painting slogans on walls and were surprised by the Israeli squad. The death brought to 240 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died. Meanwhile, the leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two major political parties intensified debate on the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> following Jordanian King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to cut ties with the occupied lands. In an interview with armed forces radio, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must decide in Nov. 1 elections to pursue peace before arguing over who <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s negotiating partner will be in peace talks. `` What does <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> want _ to take a peace initiative or to sit idly and let the Arabs and the Russians and the whole world run our affairs? If we do not take the initiative, and that's actually what the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc proposes, others will take it,'' warned <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the head of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> indicated he still believed that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> had to be a negotiating partner even though <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has declared he would not bargain on behalf of the Palestinians. `` We have always thought we should conduct negotiations both with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians, as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is responsible for the main border and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are those who bear the main burden of the Palestinian problem. `` We ca n't run away from facts ... What does <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> want, war or peace, that is the question?'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s industry minister, <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, argued the `` only realistic policy'' was to consider <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state since most of its 3.5 million people are Palestinian. `` The only thing to which we have to object in the strongest possible way is attempts to foist on us a second Palestinian state to our east,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who has a wide following among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hardliners, proposed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annex portions of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He said there was a consensus that much of the territory was needed for security reasons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, earlier this week ruled out annexation. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> that the status of the territories could be decided only in talks with Palestinians not affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> regards as a terrorist organization. `` We honor our international obligations and we shall not make any unilateral step, like imposing Israeli rule on the territories that are subject to negotiations,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Thursday. His reference was to the U.S.-mediated Camp David accords reached by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1978, which call for five years of autonomy for Palestinians before negotiations on the final status of land captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 A 9-year-old girl who lost her legs to frostbite after she was found abandoned in an unheated apartment last winter has told those who helped and prayed for her, `` Because of you, I am standing up today.'' `` I want to thank all the people in the world for remembering me and -LRB- for -RRB- all the donations they've given me and gifts and cards and letters and their love and prayers,'' <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> said, smiling before TV cameras at a news conference Thursday. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s ordeal touched hearts nationwide following news reports that she was found locked inside a Gary apartment Jan. 17 by a construction worker who said he heard a child's voice plead, `` Please do n't board me up.'' Hundreds of presents, thousands of letters and donations of at least $ 125,000 poured in to cheer her up and help pay hospital bills after her severely frostbitten legs were amputated just below the knee. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Gainer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said a trust account and a guardianship account for <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> now amount to $ 140,000.

Upon leaving the hospital, officials would n't let her talk to reporters, but on Thursday she held a news conference, with her great-grandmother, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, by her side, to say thanks. `` Because of you, I am standing up today,'' the girl told her supporters. `` It was her idea,'' said <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> lives with now. `` Sometimes we answer 30 or 40 cards a day. She thought going on television might be a way to thank everyone at once.'' As the television cameras rolled, she also sang a song she had written, with the words: `` Had it not been for the Lord on my side, where would I be? Where would I be?'' <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> said she plans to return to school in the fall. Her mother, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to child neglect May 6.

If <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s start-up program is successful, officials hope to broaden the distribution among the city's estimated 200,000 intravenous drug-abusers. Sample blood tests indicate about half that group are already infected with the AIDS virus. The experiment was approved this week by the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and local prosecutors have judged it to be legal, the Times said. Critics of the needles plan, including some prosecutors and black officials, contend it will promote illicit drug abuse. `` The end is commendable, of course,'' said <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a black who is against the plan. `` But I maintain that drug use is unacceptable, and I do not accept the notion that we can make drugs safer.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, needle use has become the leading method of infection for new AIDS cases. The 200 people to receive needles will be chosen from waiting lists of addicts seeking drug treatment. Another 200 will be chosen as a control group; they will not receive needles but their drug behavior and AIDS infection will be monitored. Anyone who receives free needles will be required to turn in used ones each time they get another, to prevent improper distribution of the needles.

<HEAD>Leader Of Boy Sex Ring Once A Teen Prostitute Himself, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who was once a teen-age prostitute has been charged with running an eight-year-old sex ring that sold the services of hundreds of boys, sometimes flying them to other cities, police said. Accused ringleader <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 26, earned a living from prostitution from age 12 to 16, eventually giving it up to start the pedophile ring eight years ago, said Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. The Tampa-based operation came to light when the parents of an 11-year-old contacted police after wondering how their son got large amounts of cash. A four-month probe led to the arrests of <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and two other Floridians in June, police disclosed Wednesday. The investigation continues, and authorities say they expect more arrests in other cities. For eight years, the network sent boys to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to meet adult clients, said <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, an unemployed avionics technician, understood the psyche of the boys he hired _ most of them from poor families and broken homes _ because he was once one of them, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. He used boys to recruit others, flashing wads of cash as a lure, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the kids despised the sex, but the financial inducements were too enticing to the youngsters,'' said <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. The underground child prostitution operation involved hundreds of youths ages 11 to 16, who earned from $ 300 to $ 700 for a single meeting, police said. Getting the boys to admit their activities was difficult because of a quiet bond between them, and officials said that slowed the investigation. `` The members' loyalty stood even when faced with prison,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, was arrested in June on a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> warrant charging him with capital sexual battery, procuring children under 16 for prostitution and deriving financial support from prostitution, according to <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. He is being held without bond. The others arrested were identified as car salesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 30, who works for a paint company. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was charged with lewd and lascivious acts with a child; <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> was charged with performing a sexual act with a child. Both were released on bond.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> called today for a political truce during the Olympics and warned that violent protests would expose the country to `` worldwide scorn.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> condemned demonstrations by radical students and said dissident groups were trying to spoil the mood before the Sept. 17 start of the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. He appealed to opposition leaders to support the government in curbing unrest. `` An eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs, stones and tear gas during the Olympics would disrupt the Olympics and our nation would become an object of worldwide scorn,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a meeting reviewing Olympic preparations. Later, radical students battled riot police with firebombs and rocks at least three campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after rallies to prepare for a march Monday to the border for reunification talks with North Korean students. Riot police fired tear gas to drive students back. Eyewitnesses reported some arrests and injuries, but police refused to give any figures. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said today that 2,099 radicals were detained the previous two days for taking part in demonstrations to support the Monday march, which the government has prohibited. All but 243 students were released. Police officials said 13 police stations were attacked by students nationwide this week and several dozen officers were injured. Radical students have staged scattered protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities to prepare for the march and fought riot police in minor confrontations in some places. Turnouts at rallies during the past five days have been low. A similar march June 10 for talks with North Korean student delegates was blocked by riot police. Support for the latest march appears to be low because of public opposition, a summer heat wave and college vacations. Also today, Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON> suggested that delegates from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> meet at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> next Friday to discuss the possibility of a North-South parliamentary meeting. The North has proposed the discussion be held Wednesday. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> made its counterproposal in a letter delivered to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> inside the Demilitarized Zone. In a letter sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the working meeting, if held, should discuss only logistical arrangements for full parliamentary talks which it hopes would be held before the end of this month. Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The students, a small but vocal minority on college campuses, have failed to gain support because of their violent tactics and open advances to the communist North. The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War. The North is demanding that <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to let it be a co-host at the Games, but the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has said the Olympics can not be shared. As a result, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said it will boycott the event. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s latest attempt to persuade <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to change its mind On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON> proposed that the North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> teams could march side by side in the opening and closing ceremonies, each carrying its own flag, while a single Olympic flag preceded the overall Korean group. He said North Korean participation would demonstrate its `` strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation.'' `` We are still very anxious to have their participation,'' said <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-ung </PERSON>, director general of international press for the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Organizing Committee. `` If <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accepts the <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> offer, it would be a very good idea to march in parallel with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the opening ceremony,'' <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A reputed drug kingpin in prison and 36 other people, including his parents, wife and girlfriend, were charged with running a narcotics cartel linked to the assassination of a police officer and nine other murders. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` Fat Cat'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, serving a 25-years-to-life sentence for state narcotics and weapons law violations, was accused of controlling the $ 20-million-a-year organization through his lieutenants and family members. According to a federal complaint released Thursday, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> continued to direct his drug operations from jail. `` This is really a story of how a handful of women kept this drug operation together while their men were in prison,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuiness </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, described the <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> group as `` the most active and most vicious drug ring in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Thirty people _ including <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' parents, sister, three nieces, wife, girlfriend and brother-in-law _ were arrested in a sweep Thursday. Others were arrested out of state, said police spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. They were charged with distributing heroin and cocaine. No murder charges were filed. But the federal complaint stated that members of the <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> organization are suspected in at least 10 narcotics-related homicides since 1985, including that of police Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' parole officer, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, in 1985. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was shot execution-style in February as he sat in his police cruiser, guarding the home of a drug witness. `` The death of Officer <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was a catalyst to all of us in law enforcement,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. `` Whatever made them commit that insane act of murder has backfired on this organization.'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, his alleged lieutenant, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, and others were previously charged with <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s murder. The complaint attributed its information to 12 confidential informants and taps on the phones at the house of <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, and a deli which allegedly served as a <ORGANIZATION> Nichols </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The Nichols organization was said to include a network of drug suppliers, baggers, dealers and money handlers who distribute heroin and cocaine throughout the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area.

 Relatives of people who died in the world's worst single-plane accident today marked the third anniversary of the disaster by visiting the mountain where the jumbo jet crashed. About 120 relatives and 30 officials of <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, including president <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamachi </PERSON>, attended a ceremony in heavy rain in <LOCATION> Ueno-mura </LOCATION>, 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. On Aug. 12, 1985, a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 en route to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> crashed and killed all but four of 524 people on board. Organizers of victims' family groups said claims for compensation from <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> and the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have been hindered because of the number of people involved in two countries. `` It was the worst airplane accident the world has ever seen, and the aftermath of the accident is highly complicated because the case intertwines interests of more than one country and over thousands of people,'' said <PERSON> Kuniko </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyajima </PERSON>, an organizer of bereaved families. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> last year concluded that faulty repair work by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and poor maintenance by <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> after a previous mishap led to the rupture of a rear cabin wall on the aircraft, which caused the crash. In 1979, the jumbo jet suffered a damaged bulkhead when it skidded on its tail during a rough landing at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. So far, families of 334 victims have reached settlement with <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> officials. Most families of the remaining victims are either proceeding with suits against <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> or individually negotiating with the companies through lawyers, according to <PERSON> Miyajima </PERSON>. Terms of compensation have not been disclosed either by the companies or lawyers of the families of the victims. However, sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said the cost will be shared by the two companies with 17.5 percent paid by <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> and 82.5 percent by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. Both <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> have admitted liability for the crash and have reportedly offered about $ 100,000 to $ 135,000 compensation for each victim, but <PERSON> Miyajima </PERSON> said she is not satisfied with the offer. `` Judging from cruelty of the accident and the pain which bereaved people have to go through, our feeling is that victims deserve at least more than what automobile accident victims get,'' said <PERSON> Miyajima </PERSON>, who lost her 9 year-old son in the crash. `` They have to consider that passengers were exposed to an extreme degree of fear for half an hour while the aircraft was flying in the air without control before crashing,'' she said. She also said about 30 bereaved relatives of the victims are refusing even to negotiate because `` they can not get over the pain of facing the agony of losing their beloved ones every time they sit at a negotiation table and discuss the accident.''

<HEAD>State Files Suit To Force Mecham To Relinquish Protocol Fund</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says a lawsuit seeking to wrest an $ 80,000 protocal fund from him is `` frivolous'' and he expects to win a court fight over the money, which was central to his impeachment conviction. The state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> brought suit against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Thursday aimed at forcing him to give the money to Gov. Rose Mofford, the Democrat who succeeded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> when he was convicted on impeachment charges April 4. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, however, told reporters that he mailed the money back to the original 687 contributors Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> said the bank will not pay on the checks until a court decides who is entitled to the money. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> called the lawsuit `` one of the biggest travesties of a waste of taxpayers' money on a frivolous lawsuit I've ever seen.'' He predicted the court would declare the fund to be private money, thus proving the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had no grounds to convict him of misusing $ 80,000 from the fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also was convicted of trying to thwart a probe of an alleged death threat. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, who filed the civil suit, said he believes the protocol fund belongs to the state. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> unsuccessfully prosecuted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in criminal court in May on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The lawsuit asks that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> be forced to give the state all the money remaining in the account as of April 5, the day after he was removed from office. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> decided to sue after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> rejected a state offer that would have allowed him to return the money to the donors after providing a full accounting of the funds and asking the contributors if they wanted to give the money to charity. `` We've made an offer to him; he rejected it,'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. `` That's still on the table.'' The protocol fund at one time totaled about $ 92,000, but <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has said some of the money was spent on state purposes. The fund was created with receipts from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s January 1987 inaugural ball, and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> originally intended to use the receipts to help repay his campaign debt. But questions were raised about whether the inaugural fund raising complied with <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s campaign finance law, and the money was converted to a protocol fund in June 1987 in an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION>'s Office. That agreement, signed by <ORGANIZATION> Mecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, said the money was to be used `` solely for purposes of promoting the interests of the state, or to promote and encourage citizen public service to the state.'' But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has contended he was unaware of the agreement and is not bound by it. The lawsuit said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` has for financial gain knowingly exercised control over the protocol fund with the intent to deprive the Office of the Governor of control of those funds.''

The dismissal came a week after Business Week said it was probing pre-publication trading linked to `` Inside Wall Street.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the major stock exchanges also have launched investigations. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> was fired after company lawyers uncovered records suggesting stocks might have been bought and sold on tips from articles due to be published in the magazine. Court papers indicated <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> and an unidentified person paid various <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> employees $ 20 to $ 30 an issue for advance copies of Business Week on Thursday mornings. The magazine generally was made available to the public after the markets closed Thursday afternoons. <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> was accused of trading Thursday mornings on the securities of companies that got a favorable mention in `` Inside Wall Street.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishes Guidelines For Use Of Anonymous Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A confidential source whose identification by the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> resulted in a jury verdict against the newspaper has prompted new guidelines at the newspaper on using anonymous sources. In a front page announcement Thursday, the newspaper described the new guidelines to its readers. `` We know that some readers are concerned about recent questions involving the use of anonymous sources in the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. So are we, and we're taking action to deal with those questions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> Executive Editor <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> wrote. The announcement follows a verdict granting damages to a public relations man who gave the paper and other news organizations information about a political opponent's shoplifting charge six days before a 1982 election. He gave the information on condition he would remain anonymous and claimed in his suit that identification of him by the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> hurt his career. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> also said a recent Star Tribune article on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> that reported on `` alleged wrongdoing on the basis of anonymous sources who did n't have firsthand knowledge to support their account'' illustrated the risks to fairness and accuracy that can result from use of anonymous sources. In a third recent incident, the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> recalled all 640,000 copies of its Sunday magazine scheduled to appear one weekend because, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said, a person quoted by name in the magazine said she had been promised anonymity. The guidelines make three main points, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said: _ While anonymous sources are a critical element of some important stories, frequent reliance on them increases the risk of inaccurate or unfair journalism and can adversely affect the newspaper's credibility with readers _ Anonymous statements and quotes should be published only when necessary to provide important information and only after both a reporter and editor are satisfied that the paper is meeting its standards for accuracy and fairness _ Promises of confidentiality to sources that are not in the newspaper's or the readers' best interests should be avoided, but once made, will be honored except in the most extraordinary circumstances <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the guidelines `` replace the mostly unwritten guidelines and standards we've relied on before.'' On July 22, a <ORGANIZATION> Hennepin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found that the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> broke a contract by identifying <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> as a confidential source for a story and must pay him a total of $ 700,000 in damages. The newspapers are appealing the verdict. Reporters for the two newspapers, who separately accepted court documents from <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> on condition his identity not be revealed, were overruled by their editors, who decided to name <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said that, under the new guidelines, `` a reporter should not promise anonymity in a situation similar to <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s, but if the reporter makes such a promise, the editors will honor it.''

 Seven out of 10 American voters think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can trust the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> enough to sign a treaty eliminating most of both nations' nuclear weapons by the turn of the century, according to a poll. Such developments as the Reagan-Gorbachev summits and the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are eroding Americans' longstanding mistrust of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, pollster <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelovich </PERSON> said Thursday. But he said six in 10 voters still regard the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as `` a serious threat'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and more than a third trust the Soviets `` not at all.'' The poll was one of several commissioned for `` Americans Talk Security,'' a series of surveys on national defense and security issues financed by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. In telephone interviews with 1,000 registered voters, <ORGANIZATION> Yankelovich </ORGANIZATION>'s firm found a majority trusted the Soviets enough to believe that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could: _ Sign a treaty to eliminate most nuclear weapons by the year 2000 -LRB- 71 percent -RRB-. _ Work together to stop illicit drug trafficking -LRB- 85 percent -RRB-; halt environmental pollution -LRB- 85 percent -RRB-; fight terrorism -LRB- 78 percent -RRB-; resolve conflicts in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> and other trouble spots -LRB- 72 percent -RRB-. _ Expand cultural exchanges -LRB- 84 percent -RRB-. The survey, taken in July shortly after the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, noted a 7 percent increase _ to 68 percent _ from March in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters' belief that relations with the Soviets are improving. But <PERSON> Yankelovich </PERSON> also noted a persistent strain of mistrust toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with 60 percent describing it as a major threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from 76 percent before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took office. Only 36 percent thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should sell non-military high technology to the Soviets; 34 percent would stop work on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> as part of a nuclear arms agreement; 28 percent favored sharing SDI technology with the Soviets as it is developed. Women without a college education were far more mistrustful of the Soviets and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> than similarly educated men or college-educated men and women, a finding which <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marttila </PERSON> said `` flies somewhat in the face of conventional wisdom.'' Although 37 percent of all voters said they trusted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` not at all,'' 43 percent of women took that stand, compared with only 30 percent of men. Referring to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` gender gap,'' Republican pollster <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said, `` This -LRB- information -RRB- is something the vice president can use in his campaign.'' The poll has a margin of error of 3 percent.

<TEXT>
 A man who says he witnessed the downing of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bomber during World War II has challenged the vice president's contention that the aircraft was on fire when he bailed out, leaving behind two crew mates who were presumed dead, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said in interviews with the Post that the plane was not engulfed in flames, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has claimed, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could have made a water landing and possibly saved the lives of the two men. `` I think he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- could have saved those lives, if they were alive,'' <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I do n't know that they were, but at least they had a chance if he had attempted a water landing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has referred to the Sept. 2, 1944, downing in the presidential campaign this year and described it in detail in interviews and in his autobiography. Describing the scene in his book, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote his aircraft was hit on a diving run to bomb a Japanese radio installation in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bonin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. `` Smoke poured into the cockpit, and I could see flames rippling across the crease of the wing, edging toward the fuel tanks,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. He said he finished dropping the bombs and then, losing control of his plane, ejected over the ocean after radioing his gunner and radioman to jump and getting no response. In a television interview aired last December, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described the ordeal as `` about as close as you get'' to death. `` The plane was in smoke and the wings were burning,'' he said. <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON>, who was the turret gunner in the tail of squadron commander <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON>'s plane, which led the tight formation bombing raid, disagreed. He said he was `` about 100 feet'' ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plane and saw only `` a puff of smoke'' which quickly dissipated. There was no more smoke, he said, and he insists <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` plane was never on fire'' and that `` no smoke came out of his cockpit when he opened his canopy to bail out.'' The intelligence report on the loss of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plane reports that `` smoke and flame'' engulfed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s engine, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The report was signed by <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> and an intelligence officer, now deceased. Squadron members interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> disagreed about whether <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON> would have had the best line of sight on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plane, and <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON> was the only one to claim he saw the plane downed. <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON> said that after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rescued and returned to their aircraft carrier 30 days later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approached <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON> and, `` he said: ` Ski, I'm sure those two men were dead. I called them on the radio three times. They were dead.' ... `` He seemed distraught. He was trying to assure me he did the best he could. I'm thinking, what am I going to say to him? I have to give him the benefit of the doubt.'' <PERSON> Mierzejewski </PERSON> said he wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this March to tell him his public descriptions were `` entirely different from my recall of the incident,'' but did not hear back from the vice president. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has told us time and time again what happened that day. To suggest that his account is inaccurate is absurd.''

His recovery went smoothly until July 28, when he suffered a common side effect of the surgery called an arterial spasm, which narrows the artery so blood can not get through. He was given an experimental drug called nicardipine, which relaxes the artery wall and prevents further spasms. About 5,000 of the 25,000 people who survive burst aneurysms each year die from arterial spasms after surgery.

<HEAD>World's Biggest Port Debates South African Coal Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid groups oppose plans to build a new port terminal here unless the coal importer pushing the idea embargoes South African coal. But high unemployment is making the project hard to turn down. About 44 percent of the 10.7 million tons of coal shipped through <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, the world's biggest port, come from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to city government statistics. The Frans Swarttouw company, which claims to handle a third of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>'s coal import business, wants to build a $ 46.7 million coal terminal. <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> city officials are debating whether to invest $ 57 million in new roads, docks and other construction works that would go up around the terminal. The projects could help curb the city's 25 percent unemployment. The Kairos anti-apartheid group wants approval of the $ 57 million investment contingent on a Swarttouw promise not to handle any South African coal. `` The handling of South African coal is a serious stain on the port of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kairos </PERSON> wrote in a recent letter to City Hall. `` Transshipment here helps shippers to conceal the coal's South African origin.'' According to <PERSON> Kairos </PERSON>, large amounts of South African coal are being shipped from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> to nations that have embargoed South African coal. The left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 24-seat majority in the 45-seat city council, said in its 1986 election platform that `` The port of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> may not be abused for ... the import of products from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, particularly coal.'' <PERSON> Swarttouw </PERSON>'s general director, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjouke </PERSON>, conceded Thursday that about a third of the coal handled by <PERSON> Swarttouw </PERSON> is of South African origin, but said `` If you want to impose a boycott -LRB- of South African coal -RRB- I think you want to talk to the consumers at the end of the line.'' Most of the coal imported via <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> is used by electric power stations in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and other European nations. The new terminal, scheduled for completion in 1998, has been designed to handle coal carriers of up to 250,000 tons, in line with a current trend toward the use of larger vessels, <PERSON> Sjouke </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. There is strong public and official disapproval in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> of apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation. The Dutch government supports tougher sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by the 12 member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> but refuses to impose a South African coal import ban until all 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members agree to do the same. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> are the only two <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member nations that have imposed such an embargo, along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Most Intensive-Care Patients Would Undergo Treatment Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new study finds that most elderly patients who survived one life-threatening illness would submit to intensive care a second time, but doctors say that finding leads to serious questions about the use of resources. `` We undertook this study to help doctors deal with one dilemma _ when to use life-sustaining treatment _ and we've come up with another,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Danis </PERSON>, one of the authors of the study published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The subjects of the study were 160 people, 55 or older, who were admitted to intensive care at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for at least 24 hours during 1983, the authors said. Of those interviewed, 74 percent later reported they would be completely willing to undergo intensive care again to prolong survival for any period, even as brief as one month, the study said. Four percent said they were unwilling to undergo more intensive care for any period. Of the remaining 22 percent, most expressed varying preferences depending on duration of survival. `` The patients in our study are saying they want to receive highly technical care under almost any condition _ as late as the last month of their life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Danis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said Thursday. `` And our society is going to have to think about what's the most appropriate use of our medical-care resources. It may turn out that these are wishes that will prove very difficult to fill.'' The patients' preferences appeared to hold true regardless of quality of life, life expectancy, age, severity of illness, length of stay or intensive-care cost, the study found. Families surveyed on behalf of patients who had died or been left incompetent after intensive-care treatment felt the same way, indicating the feeling did not depend on successful treatment. `` You have to recognize the limitations of the study,'' Ms. <PERSON> Danis </PERSON> said. `` The patients who provided our subjects already had shown a willingess to undergo intensive-care treatment in the face of one life-threatening illness. But that could also be one of its strengths. `` Many times, doctors face life-sustaining decisions without any input from the patients. This study informs physicians about the opinions of patients who've been in that spot.'' But one researcher questioned the finding that quality of life concerns had just a small impact on patient preference. In an editorial accompanying the study, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s department of medicine, said the study dealt with quality-of-life considerations only in a general way. `` Evidence suggests that when faced with such decisions, patients consider a number of more concrete factors,'' such as the presence and level of long-term pain, likelihood of getting better, ability for self-care and mobility, ability to think straight and burden on family, said Ms. <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, a researcher in social policy and aging.

<TEXT>
 Sea lions along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> are being stricken by a disease that is contagious to humans, and a marine expert is warning people not to approach the ailing creatures that may be found on beaches. More than 40 sick or dying animals infected with the the microorganism leptospira have been found on beaches this summer, said <PERSON> Peigin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Leptospirosis last hit the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lion population in 1984, killing as many as 10,000 of the animals. <PERSON> Barret </PERSON> said the microorganisms invade the kidneys and liver and warned that humans should not approach the creatures if they are found on a beach. `` We want to make sure people stay away from stricken animals,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. `` We have really serious concern for both animals and people.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION> said news about the disease had sparked a mild panic among fishermen, surfers and others who frequent beaches. However, she said even those who handle sea lions for a living are unlikely to contract the disease. `` We're not that worried about it,'' she said. `` There's no cause for alarm for leptospirosis in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lions,'' <PERSON> Denize </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, assistant to the executive director of the mammal center, said Thursday. The ailing sea lions are being treated with tetracycline, but the mortality rate is 39 percent, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. Initial reports of ailing sea lions began in early June. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said that through Wednesday, center volunteers had responded to 43 cases, with a current rate of two a day. When the animals get too weak to swim, they come ashore, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. The animals have been found from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> boundary. Scientists are puzzled by both the cause of the disease and its present occurrence, since the epidemic seems to strike every 10 years, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to try a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SS </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp guard the Czech's sentenced to death in absentia in 1948, the Communist daily Rude Pravo said today. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> sentenced <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON>, 76, after convicting him of committing war crimes at the <LOCATION> Theresienstadt </LOCATION> concentration camp, where about 33,700 people died. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to extradite him. Italian officials put <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON> on an airplane from <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> on Wednesday, after his arrest last week at his wife's home in the northern Italian town of <LOCATION> Merano </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have no extradition treaty, and Italian law bars extraditing someone facing the death penalty. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> does not have capital punishment. West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothen </PERSON> said officials determined <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON> is a West German citizen and can not be extradited under its constitution. A West German prosecutor said Thursday that <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON> was hospitalized near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> with unspecified `` serious illnesses'' that will prevent interrogation for at least three weeks. Prosecutor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON>, who is leading the inquiry into <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON>'s past, said he has no plans to bring criminal charges against the former concentration camp guard. West German officials say <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON>, who wants to return to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, is free to move about as he pleases. Rude Pravo said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacil </PERSON>, has asked West German authorities to `` take necessary steps to bring <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON> to court.'' It said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is handing over results of its investigations into <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON>'s past to West German authorities to facilitate prosecution. The director of the national memorial in the town where the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> camp was located told Rude Pravo that 2,400 documents provide evidence of <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON>'s crimes. The <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency, which carried excerpts of the interview, quoted <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> as saying the crimes included `` grievous bodily harms, killings and murders.'' <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON> `` voluntarily and with pleasure asked to be a member of execution squads,'' <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> told Rude Pravo. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> as saying `` several dozen'' witnesses to <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON>'s crimes are still alive. Vienna-based Nazi hunter <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Maloth </PERSON> hid with his family in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for 15 years.

 A Polish dancer who defected to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to join a woman he fell in love with has learned she already was engaged to be married, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and the woman's friends said today. Polish officials in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said they would not force the dancer, identified as <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Irinauch </PERSON>, to return, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said he could stay at least until his visa expires on Aug. 29. Irinauch, in the late 20s, disappeared Tuesday after his 46-member Slovianki dance company performed at a festival in the northern port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> police said he defected to join an Israeli folk dancer he met when both were performing in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> two years ago. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Irinauch </PERSON> wrote regularly to the woman, who the radio identified as <PERSON> Mira </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a nurse and a member of the <LOCATION> Hora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> dancing troupe. The woman's friends said in interviews that <PERSON> Irinauch </PERSON> told Miss <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> he planned to defect, but she then disclosed she was engaged to be married. Irinauch still decided to defect, partly because he is Jewish, the friends said on condition of anonymity. They said Miss <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> and her fiance, <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> <PERSON> Alter </PERSON>, agreed to help. The radio said <PERSON> Irinauch </PERSON> was hiding at Alter's home in the town of Beer Yaakov near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Telephone calls to the home today went unanswered. Miss <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> refused to discuss the defection, except to say: `` I'm calm I know he has nothing to fear, and that everything will be all right,'' the radio reported. <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavinsky </PERSON>, a diplomat at the Polish interest office in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would not seek the dancer's extradition, but he was free to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> if he wished. Under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return, all Jews have the right to automatic Israeli citizenship. The legal adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabel </PERSON>, said a non-Jewish defector could receive political asylum also, as long as the defector proves political persecution in his or her home country.

<TEXT>
 South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> today held talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet and British diplomats on <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a South African diplomat said. The talks took place at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, said a secretary at the mission who spoke on condition of anonymity. The South African diplomat, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a series of bilateral meetings were planned along with the talks. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and South African Energy Minister <PERSON> Danie </PERSON> <PERSON> Steyn </PERSON> would convey their government's willingness to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection. In the past, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has refused to sign the 1969 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit all its nuclear facilities to inspection by the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is widely believed to have the technical capability to produce an atomic bomb, but there is debate about whether it actually has produced any. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the talks is headed by Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation led by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s permanent representative to the international organization in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Timer </PERSON> <PERSON> Baev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> delegation is reportedly headed by Under Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steyn </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has said it is not invloved in the discussions. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been under increasing pressure at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to submit its nuclear facilities to inspection. African and other Third World member countries have repeatedly attempted to have <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ousted as a member, largely because of apartheid, the policy under which the nation's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. At last year's general assembly, a decision on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s expulsion was postponed after <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> announced it was considering joining the treaty Last month, diplomats in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said they expected <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to make a move before the next annual general assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in September. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are the three `` nuclear weapon states'' that have joined the treaty, which so far has been signed by a total of 137 countries. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, two other countries with a known nuclear weapons potential, are not signatory to the treaty. Under the treaty, signatories pledge to submit their nuclear programs to agancy controls, and the agency's inspectors must make sure material is not diverted to other than peaceful uses.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said today that a tough sanctions bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> will not help South African blacks and might derail a regional peace initiative. `` The recklessness of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who do not care in the least whether their actions adversely affect the search for a peaceful solution to the problems of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a whole is astounding,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. He said the legislation, which was forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after a vote Thursday night, might `` obstruct or make impossible'' an ongoing initiative to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 73-year rule over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The sanctions bill, which still needs <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature to become law, would halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and impose a near-total trade embargo. It was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 244-132, with most Democrats supporting it and most Republicans opposing it. The bill faces a possible Republican filibuster in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a likely veto by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Earlier legislation, which passed despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, bars imports of various South African commodities and forbids South African planes to land at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in a statement that the pending bill was being debated `` for purely internal political aims.'' `` It -LRB- the bill -RRB- has no bearing on the promotion of the interests of black people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> are by now fully aware that prominent black leaders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as well as governments in certain neighboring states, strongly oppose this legislation.'' Prominent black anti-apartheid leaders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, have urged the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to impose tougher sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to grant full political rights to the black majority. Under <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s policy of apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs Many black moderates and conservatives, as well as several prominent white liberals, have supported <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s contention that sanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will harden the white minority's resistance to political change. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he found it `` particularly remarkable'' that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> acted on the bill `` exactly at a time when positive progress was being made with the peace negotiations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' The three countries on Monday announced a cease-fire in the 13-year Angolan war. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it was prepared to start granting independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> Nov. 1 as part of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, provided an agreement was reached later this month on a timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops have been supporting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in its fight against the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is not a party to the cease-fire. `` It would be ironical if -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> -RRB- should reach the point of implementation only to be obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in the American legislation,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Official: More Than 83,000 Houses Destroyed by Sudan Floods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Floods have destroyed about 83,000 homes in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, more than twice the number previously estimated, the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The floods, which hit over the weekend after torrential rains, caused shortages of electricity, drinking water and food in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, a city of 4 million residents. At least 11 people were killed, and Sudanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said 1.5 million people were left homeless. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said a lack of boats was hampering relief operations for people stranded on piles of rubble. The Egyptian state-owned news agency quoted an unidentified Sudanese official as saying the floods destroyed 83,240 houses in the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> area alone. Previous estimates ranged from 10,000 to 40,000. The new figure did not include the number of houses destroyed by floods in eastern and northern areas of the country. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspapers today said <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> state television showed <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> touring flooded areas in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and complaining that tents, food and medicine were not reaching flood victims fast enough. He blamed lack of coordination among government agencies. Among those worst hit are southern refugees, estimated at 750,000 to 1 million, who fled a 5-year-old civil war in the south and are living in canvas, tin and mud huts on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Many of their flimsy shacks were washed away by flood waters. Sudanese officials blamed the floods on inadequate drainage systems. Last week, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and surrounding areas received 8.4 inches of rain, compared with 1.44 inches in all of 1987. Officials say the country faces more destruction from the annual flooding of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in coming weeks. They said the river level has risen dangerously after heavy rains in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, whose rivers feed into the Nile. International aid has poured into <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> from Arab and West European countries. But in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said a lack of boats is hampering relief distribution. `` The problem is how to reach people,'' said <PERSON> Hybad </PERSON> <PERSON> Chowdhury </PERSON>, senior officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of the Disaster Relief Coordinator. `` Many have taken to high ground, on piles of rubble. You ca n't commission a lot of boats like in southeast <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries.'' About 2,500 tents and 80,000 blankets have been airlifted to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, but more are needed, he said. Cash aid by the international community so far totals $ 3 million. No disease outbreaks have been reported despite the dangers of stagnant water, which can not drain into <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s non-porous soil, he said. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appealed today for more international aid to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. National societies and governments have contributed more than 100 tons of relief supplies, including 1 million water purification tablets, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. Cash contributions through the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> totaled $ 840,000.

 The Duke and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today left a hospital with their newborn daughter, the Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. As the proud parents waved to hundreds of well-wishers, the newest member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family slept. The baby, still unnamed, was swaddled in a white blanket for her first public appearance, broadcast live on British television. Born Monday night weighing 6 pounds, 12 ounces, she is the first child for <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the second oldest son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>. She is the queen's fifth grandchild and fifth in line to the throne. The duke and duchess, both 28, waved to the crowd as they left central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at 12:37 p.m. with the princess for an undisclosed location. Before leaving, the duchess handed the baby to her husband, then stumbled on the pavement as she accepted a bouquet of pink carnations from an American tourist. `` I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Alasio </PERSON> of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I'm very glad she did n't fall over all the way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.'' A palace spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom, said the duchess was feeling `` fine.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> told reporters he hoped he would suffer `` only a few'' sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to his <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> duties in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next week. Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: `` I am overjoyed.'' It's not unusual for royal parents to take several days to select appropriate names for their babies. The names must be approved by the queen who is currently vacationing in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices include <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was quoted as saying in May that he favored <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. Before arriving at the hospital, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> attended a Post Office ceremony to unveil a set of postage stamps based on his photographs of famous castles. The stamps, ranging in value from 1 pound -LRB- $ 1.70 -RRB- to 5 pounds -LRB- $ 8.50 -RRB- are the first designed by a member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family. They show <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Caernarfon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Carrickfergus </LOCATION> castles, one for each country of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. All have strong royal connections. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, an accomplished amateur photographer, thanked the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> for `` having the guts'' to invite him to take the photographs.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today denied it shelled <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military positions, and President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> urged his forces to remain vigilant at the front. Also today, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for talks about <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and other foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Thursday accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of shelling Iraqi military positions near the <LOCATION> Shatt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, where the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war broke out in September 1980. But a spokesman for the War Information Headquarters in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> denied the charge as `` false propaganda,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The Iraqi charge came in a statement issued by the Iraqi Mission at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It also came three days after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to observe a formal cease-fire beginning Aug. 20 with direct peace talks to begin five days later in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. According to the statement, which was not carried in newscasts in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, `` the Iranian armed forces bombarded <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military positions'' with howitzer fire, mortar shells and small missiles. The Iraqi statement reported no casualties, and there was no independent confirmation of the attack. Earlier this week, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> a letter pledging it would not launch any attacks before the cease-fire begins. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not submit a similar letter, but <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has said he received assurances from both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that they would exercise restraint. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, in a prayer sermon at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, today urged his forces to remain at the war fronts for defense of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. A throng of worshipers chanted `` Down with the U.S.A!'' `` Down with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>!'' and `` Down With <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>!'' and pledged to obey revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The crowd was noticeably smaller than during a similar sermon attended by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter four weeks earlier. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and planned talks on `` mutual relations'' during his stay in the Iranian capital. It did not elaborate, but before leaving <PERSON> London </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said he would speak with officials about the 18 foreign hostages believed held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seeks the release of three of its nationals held by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> man with dual British and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nationality whose release is also sought by the Irish government. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been making conciliatory statements about relations with Western nations since it accepted on July 18 a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> call for a cease-fire in the gulf war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the resolution shortly after it was passed in July 1987. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fact-finding team also arrived today in the Iranian capital to investigate allegations of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s renewed use of chemical weapons, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The Iranian news agency said the four-member team of chemical weapons experts would travel to the northwestern Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Oshnaviyeh </LOCATION> in the province of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> alleges that a chemical weapon attack on the town earlier this month injured more than 2,000 civilians. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reports have confirmed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons in the past. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group with 350 officers from 24 countries is to monitor the planned cease-fire.

<TEXT>
 American and Soviet educators are learning new ways to teach students about each other's country by grappling with such tough issues as the death penalty in an unusual program. But the educators are also discovering how common their worries are. `` I am struck by how much we are all in the same boat,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitrofanovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannov </PERSON>, the principal of a secondary school in <LOCATION> Novosibirsk </LOCATION>. He is one of 40 teachers, administrators and researchers at the two-week program at <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Among the many problems the groups share, he said, were `` the evaluation of teachers and students and staff, and the improving of education. Everybody says teachers should teach better, as if a child was a pan into which you could pour information like water.'' The program was planned by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pedagogical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Educators for Social Responsibility, a non-profit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organization with 15,000 members, founded in 1981 to help educators teach students a sense of social responsibility. The purpose of the education summit is to share insights into the ways each country teaches its children about the other and to break through the propaganda for a better understanding of the two nations. Lessons about each other's country `` are fraught with problems, strong feelings, misinformation, deeply embedded assumptions and resistance to new information, all related to tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dieringer </PERSON>, associate director of Educators for Social Responsibility. The program opened Tuesday with frank talks about how each group thought the other perceived it. The Soviets, for example, said they thought Americans saw them as aggressors `` trying to take over the world,'' <PERSON> Dieringer </PERSON> said. `` We thought that they thought there was a great disparity between the rich and poor in our country and that we do n't care about the poor,'' he said. `` In many cases there's some kernel of truth in these stereotypes, but they are so exaggerated ... that they serve to distort and limit our understanding of each other.'' Also on the agenda is an examination of each country's textbooks, a look at educational reforms in both countries and strategies for teaching controversial issues using human rights as case studies Thursday, the groups learned `` believing exercises,'' a way of suspending judgment to understand other viewpoints before looking at them critically. They were asked to make statements supporting the position that `` there are some crimes so horrible and so abusive that they demand capital punishment.'' For many participants, it was impossible to suspend their doubts about the death penalty enough to understand how others could support it. `` This issue is so loaded for me that it comes up against my strongest bias,'' said an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman. A Soviet woman said she could n't `` imagine this institution,'' although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, like many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states, has a death penalty. The idea for the gathering was laid out in a 1987 memorandum of cooperation between the Academy and <PERSON> Dieringer </PERSON>'s group, he said. The list of cooperative ventures also included working together on curriculum and exchanging articles that would be published, unedited, in each organization's respective journals. A team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educators visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a week last year to plan the program and a Soviet team came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in March for further planning. The next institute, on critical thinking, will be held next summer in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal prosecutor said his office and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> will investigate last weekend's riot at a lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> park to determine whether police violated federal civil rights laws. As of Thursday night, 81 people had filed charges of police brutality with a city police review board. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office said in a statement Thursday that it would conduct a preliminary review of the melee at <ORGANIZATION> Tompkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether a formal investigation is warranted. Fifty-two people were injured and seven were arrested during the riot at the park late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. The incident began with a protest against police enforcement of a 1 a.m. park curfew. Meanwhile, residents of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> area planned a park cleanup, followed by a march, concert and rally protesting the violence. The activities are expected to begin Saturday morning and end around nightfall. Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, a police spokesman, said `` if there is not an undue amount of people, the plan is to have nine or 10 seasoned police officers enforce the noise laws and other laws inside the park. If there's a lot of people, we're going to have to change our plans.'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has criticized the initial police response, saying it lacked adequate planning and that tactical errors were made. However, a group representing 400 merchants sent a letter to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> defending the police, saying they `` do not countenance the anti-social activities of drug addicts, vagrants and anarchists, and we demand and expect strong police response to such activities.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> asked four members of the review board to investigate the brutality charges, as well as the management and planning of the police at the scene. The police probe also will investigate allegations that some officers covered their badges or took them off, in violation of police policy.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s 74-year-old sister sobbed as she testified that the executor of her brother's estate talked of his cremation even before his death. <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, testifying in a lawsuit challenging her brother's last will, said the subject came up in late January 1987 while <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was at <LOCATION> Eisenhower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died Feb. 4, 1987 of complications of AIDS She said the entertainer's longtime attorney, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, came to the hospital and began discussing cremation of the entertainer at the time of his death. `` He was discussing cremation before my brother even died,'' Ms. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> testified. She said the subject was raised again later at <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home when the entertainer returned there to die. `` I told him: ` We're Catholics. I will never cremate my brother,''' she said, beginning to cry. State District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> called a recess and the subject was not discussed when her testimony resumed. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was not cremated. Ms. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> said she did what she could to help the family financially, and felt she should be compensated accordingly when the famed pianist died. `` Our family went through <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s money like gangbusters,'' she said. `` There were a lot of expenses with my mother's health and my brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, went through millions with all his wives.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who became well-known as <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s straight man during his television series in the 1950s, died in 1983. Earlier, Ms. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> had testified that she was penniless while a defense attorney countered she had been given more than $ 100,000 the past year from a $ 590,000 trust left by her brother. Ms. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s two days of testimony came in a bitter court battle between <LOCATION> Strote </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, lawyer who is executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s vast estate and five people challenging the will signed 13 days before his death. In her second day of testimony Thursday, she criticized the trust that was set up to take care of her. She said her brother had intended for her to have everything she needed without having to be accountable to anyone. `` If I did n't have this trust, I would n't have to answer to you people for every piece of food I swallow,'' she testified. `` Liberace did n't intend for me to have a trust.'' The sister is one of the plaintiffs in the case, along with housekeepers <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s longtime manager, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, and the entertainer's companion of six years, <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. The five contend <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was too ill to understand more than 100 pages of documents when he signed a new will and trust Jan. 22, 1987. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Oshins </PERSON>, who prepared the will for Strote, said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attorney took steps to save the estate money and consulted with <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> before drafting the documents. <PERSON> Oshins </PERSON> noted that many of those in the will were given more in the documents Strote drafted than in prior Liberace wills.

 <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> first rose to prominence in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> by commanding an army company that shot and killed 22 protesting students in a 1962 riot at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Last March, when thousands of students went on a rampage in some of the worst rioting in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s history, it again was <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> who led the forces that put them down. Analysts had suggested the 64-year-old hard-liner would be a logical scapegoat as the government of Ne Win, his close ally, sought to appease critics and stabilize the country. Instead, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> emerged last month as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful leader, succeeding <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who resigned. Protests against his authoritarian rule intensified this week, and troops shot and killed at least 95 demonstrators. Today, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned as president and as chairman of the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ virtually the country's sole political institution. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> joined the army in 1942 when <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> officers, including Ne Win, were siding with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> against the Allies - specifically <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which had colonized the onetime kingdom As the war progressed, the officers switched allegiance to the Allies, realizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> posed as much a threat to <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence as had the British. Independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948 was followed by a chaotic, 14-year experiment with democracy. That experiment ended in 1962, the year Ne Win seized power in a military coup and began to enforce his brand of economic socialism, military-backed authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the world. That same year, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> led his army unit in quelling the protest at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, firmly establishing his reputation as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out opposition. Little has been pubished about <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and others in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s senior hierarchy, most of whom live secluded lives away from the public eye <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> retired from the army and in 1977 became a member of the party's guiding body, the Central Executive Committee. He took the No. 4 party slot of joint general secretary in 1985. Also in 1985, he was named secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 position in the government after president and vice president. The 28-member council directs all state organs. He has also held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives, transport, communications, and home affairs. On March 18, in a day that was later dubbed `` Bloody Friday,'' thousands of students stormed through downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, burning cars and shouting anti- government slogans for the second time in three months. The `` Lon Htein,'' or riot police, were called out, reinforced by regular army units and armored vehicles. According to Western diplomatic and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> sources, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> commanded the police from a tactical command headquarters at the government broadcast station. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> overruled some leaders who wanted to handle the riot more leniently, the sources said. The government has since admitted to 43 deaths but more than 100 people are believed to have been killed. Analysts, among them the respected <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, had suggested <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> would take the fall for the violence, which deepened anti-government sentiments. Instead, after he became president, troops under his command again fired on demonstrators.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have agreed in principle to move <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations from the center of the capital to help ease anti-American sentiment, government officials said today.

A government source here, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

Forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, have been discussing the matter with South Korean Foreign Minister <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwang-soo </PERSON> and Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok. The source said military facilities in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compound would be relocated under long - and short-term programs, depending on the sensitivity of military facilities involved He said some facilities used for non-military purposes, such as a golf course and a ball park, would be taken over by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` as soon as possible'' and converted into a public park. Although the two countries have no disagreement over the issue, they still need to discuss details including moving costs that may run into billions of dollars, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. Many South Koreans have been demanding a relocation of the military facilities, saing their location in the center of the city blocks development.

They demand the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty signed in 1954. Their commanding headquarters are in the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The military compound in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, occupying 699 acres of land, is the home of the headquarters of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces, the 8th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the Combined ROK -LRB- Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> -RRB- - <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Forces Command and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

Also inside the compound are housing for some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and military personnel, an <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and television station and military schools and commissaries. The number of military and civilian personnel living in the compound is estimated at 6,000, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials here.

 A high school student claims a teacher's advice in auto shop class steered him in the wrong direction, and he's been driven to file suit over a botched clutch job <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> is suing the <ORGANIZATION> Corona-Norco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> for $ 250 in damages, claiming he received incorrect instruction on how to replace his car's clutch last semester. `` I was allowed to leave school in a malfunctioning car and had to pay for a full clutch job privately,'' said Price, who was a junior when he took the class. `` I also had to buy parts per teacher's instructions that were not necessary.'' Trial on the small claims court case is set for Aug. 29. Price's father, <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>, said Thursday that his son tried unsuccessfully to get the school district to reimburse him for the cost of the parts and repairs. The Prices decided to sue because school administrators were unresponsive, the elder Price said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crank </PERSON>, the school district's assistant superintendent of business services, said he had received a copy of the lawsuit Wednesday but had not had time to study it. It would be forwarded to the district's attorneys, he said. He said he was unaware of any other complaints about the auto shop program.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today that overspending by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is to blame for interest-rate increases that will raise the federal deficit $ 15 billion and impose hardships on families, farmers and businesses. The Democratic presidential nominee, speaking to a breakfast gathering at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's mansion, said interest rates would continue to rise `` if we continue to live on a credit card.'' `` As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to the door,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's what happened yesterday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He was referring to an increase in many banks' prime lending rates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been criticized in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> because he opposes construction of two new <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supercarrier task forces which would be built at the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, shipyard. Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who introduced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said he disagreed with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on that point but did not question his commitment to a strong national defense. `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I may debate the individual choices we must make, but in his commitment to the security of this nation I have no doubts, no reservations and no hesitations,'' <PERSON> Balile </PERSON> said. Also today, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said his campaign would run a one-minute advertisement this weekend in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area. The ad, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first since the primary campaign, stresses his major themes, such as economic revival, and contains footage from his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> first blamed the administration for spurring the increase in the prime lending rate in remarks he made Thursday after touring <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` A 10 percent prime rate. It's 3 -LCB- in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a rally in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` Why? Because we have n't been able to pay our bills for eight years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blamed the soaring federal deficit on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s failure to make `` tough choices'' on spending. `` We have to say no to a lot of things we'd like to say yes to,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We've got to decide whether we want Star Wars or star schools in this country.'' `` I think it's regrettable,'' he said. `` I think it's what happens after eight years of borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor spent most of Thursday trying to establish himself as a tough leader on military and foreign policy issues _ areas Republicans frequently cite as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' greatest weaknesses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, where he had eight weeks of basic training after joining the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1955. Earlier, he delivered a speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in which he said the country needed `` new leadership in the White House'' prepared to carefully manage the defense budget and negotiate further nuclear arms reductions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Deterrence requires vigilance, and determination, and leadership,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But it does not require the seemingly endless development of new and more expensive nuclear weapons systems, particularly when, thanks to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, we may have the best opportunity in our lifetime to build a safer world.'' Because of that progress, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, a greater share of the defense budget should be spent to improve conventional forces. `` We need strong, well-equipped, well-trained conventional forces,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after the tour of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, where he met with two men with whom he went through basic training. He also said the military should be prepared to help with anti-terrorism and anti-drug operations. `` We have to build strong military forces in this country based on sound planning and tough management, not wishful thinking and blank checks,'' he said, criticizing expensive weapons systems favored by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal. While in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended two fund-raisers which raised well in excess of $ 500,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 `` Victory Fund.'' After a reception at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's mansion today, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was headed to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where aides said he would emphasize his commitment to anti-drug efforts and criticize the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for cutting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> funding and other moves <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> contends have undermined the war on drugs.

 World health officials today approved a strategy to promote better world health care by training doctors to emphasize disease prevention and to pass this knowledge along to their patients. `` We want doctors everywhere to concentrate on how to keep people well, rather than always be thinking of new ways to cure them when they fall ill,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> issued its declaration at the close of the five-day conference today. The document sets out principles to change and improve world health. `` Thousands suffer and die every day from diseases which are preventable, curable or self-inflicted and millions have no ready access to health care of any kind,'' said the declaration, which was approved by 160 experts invited to the conference. `` The aim of medical education is to produce doctors who will promote the health of all people _ not merely deliver curative services to those who can afford it, or for those for whom it is readily available,'' the declaration said. It set out steps for the radical reform of medical education through cooperation with education and health ministries and community health services. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, said it was now possible to improve dramatically the health of the next generation. But he said parents were not being instructed on how to protect their children at small cost from the `` great scourges'' of disease including diarrhea, measles, tetanus, whooping cough and acute respiratory infection. He said these diseases account for more than two-thirds of the 14 million child deaths in the world each year. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said ways must be found to give people the knowledge to improve their own health. Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON>, newly appointed director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that some countries had too many doctors trained in curative medicine when the real need was for disease prevention. The conference was told that Scots were turning to alternative medicine and setting up self-help groups because of dissatisfaction with doctors. `` They are doing this because they feel they are not getting enough time or consideration or applied concern from their doctors,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Headland </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councils </ORGANIZATION>, a liaison body of regional health authorities. Mrs. <PERSON> Headland </PERSON> said women's self-help groups were set up in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> to try to reduce dependence on tranquilizers, a problem they blamed in part on doctors who prescribed the drugs over long periods. `` People want more information about their treatment and they want to be involved more in the decisions taken. They want to be treated with a bit of dignity and respect,'' she said. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, a psychiatrist, educator and president of the Edinburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> which organized the conference, said in an interview that too often, doctors do not listen to their patients nor consider how to keep them fit. `` They only think about them when they are ill. Medical education must extend to take care of people in the community _ in their homes and at work,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said He said there is a serious problem in some countries of too many doctors. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, for example, has 1,500 unemployed doctors and a union for unemployed doctors. They are taxi drivers, waiters ... <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ca n't find the salaries to pay doctors whom they could well use,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said.

 A mental hospital holding <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> today dropped its proposal to take the man who shot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on a field trip, as prosecutors turned up new writings by the presidential assailant. Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s forensic services unit, told a federal judge that the decision to drop the request was based on material received by the hospital Thursday night Reading a letter to U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has determined that further clinical assessment by Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s treatment staff is necessary before it would permit him to participate'' in a day-long field trip Comments by attorneys on both sides during the brief hearing indicated the material turned up by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> consisted of letters by <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> to an unidentified third party. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to unseal the material, which he said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had obtained through an investigation. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> described the material as letters written by <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> refused to unseal the writings, which were turned over to the court Thursday, until <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> could respond to the government's request they be made public The defense lawyer was given until Tuesday to file a written objection. Outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> told reporters the writings should be made public because `` they relate to a matter of great national importance, they relate to an individual who shot the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The public should be aware of what these materials are,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> indicated that the material turned up by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were not known to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> officials until Thursday night and was the basis for the hospital's decision to withdraw its request. `` We provided materials to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> last night; they withdrew their request for an off-site visit this morning,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. The hospital decision was announced a day after federal prosecutors cited `` disturbing entries'' made this week in <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s psychiatric treatment record. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> has been held at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> since he was acquitted by reason of insanity of charges he shot and wounded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, and two other men on March 30, 1981. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> remains confined to a wheelchair as a result of crippling injuries suffered during the shooting. The hospital had not formally made known its plans, but officials at the facility had indicated they want to take <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> on a supervised outing such as a picnic or a bowling party, according to court records. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said in Thursday's pleading that the latest treatment entries support the government's demand to review letters and writings seized from <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s room in April 1987. The writings include correspondence with multiple murderer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who is held on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row. Hospital officials abruptly dropped their request to allow <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> to visit his family over the Easter holiday last year after the Bundy correspondence was disclosed. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who presided at <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s trial for the attempted assassination of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, ordered <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> to let prosecutors examine the treatment records that figured in its decision to propose the field trip. But <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> has yet to rule on the government's request to see those writings, which he placed under court seal last summer. In a pleading filed earlier this week, <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s lawyers opposed allowing the government to see the sealed material. `` As an insanity acquittee, Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> is receiving treatment from the hospital with the ultimate goal of being rehabilitated,'' the lawyers said. `` For this treatment to succeed, Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> needs to have some sense of privacy. The government wishes to invade that privacy without any legitimate need to do so.''

 <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned today as president of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and from all his other major posts, state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said, after thousands of people protested his 17-day rule with violent demonstrations nationwide. Troops have killed at least 95 people in massive anti-government protests since <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> became president on July 27, the radio said. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elected him to replace <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who resigned after 26 years in power. However, Western diplomats said the death toll may be in the hundreds, and unconfirmed reports reaching <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> put the figure as high as 1,000. The broadcast gave no reason for the resignation, and no successor was immediately named. The radio said a special meeting of both the central committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> would meet next Friday. Earlier today, a <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> guerrilla leader called on rebel groups to launch a nationwide offensive against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s government. Soldiers in one town reportedly turned against the government and allowed thousands of protesters to march through the streets. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> security forces were trying to get rid of evidence of civilian deaths by burning bodies. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the 92nd meeting of the party's central committee today accepted <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation as the party chairman, by far the most powerful political position in the country. The report also said the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> accepted his resignation as president of the republic and from membership of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Students initially led the anti-government demonstrations, which also demand a return to democracy and economic reforms, but wide sectors of the population later joined in the bloody street battles. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, 64, a former military officer, was held responsible by demonstrators for brutal suppression of student demonstrations in March and June as well as his predecessor's earlier crackdown on dissidents. Demonstrators chanted slogans and carried placards through the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> calling <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> `` a dog,'' `` a butcher'' and `` a Nazi.'' But the radio said there were virtually no demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> today. It said protesters also dispersed in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okkalapa </LOCATION> suburbs, where workers and others have battled troops in recent days. But a Thai official speaking on condition of anonymity, said 200 soldiers and 100 policemen stayed inside while thousands of demonstrators marched freely through <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s southernmost province of <LOCATION> Megui </LOCATION> for a third straight day today Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> denied that <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Point </PERSON>, a market town of about 5,000 people, had been taken over by protesters. <PERSON> Brang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON>, leader of a coalition of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> guerrilla groups, called for an offensive `` from north to south'' to push the army from dozens of towns and cities in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. A spokesman quoted the guerrilla leader as saying rebels would attack government troops and calling on them to join in battling the government. Rebels fighting for autonomy control vast areas of the country. The spokesman, who refused to give his name, read the statement over the telephone from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Brang </LOCATION> Seng is leader of the <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> army, one of the ethnic-based rebel groups in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition. The coalition claims to field about 35,000 rebel fighters. The nine other rebel groups in the coalition could not be immediately reached for comment. A senior Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Thursday that the actual death toll from the rioting may be in the hundreds. He said solid information was virtually impossible to get, partly because soldiers and protesters were fighting a `` battle for the bodies.'' `` When someone is killed, -LRB- the protesters -RRB- try to get it, so they can display the bodies, and the government tries to get it to cremate it'' so there would be no evidence of deaths, he said. He said the leadership, accustomed to undisputed rule, simply does not know how to handle the disturbances and has assumed that if enough force is applied, the demonstrators will simply go away. Protesters have turned more violent, responding to unprovoked killings by security forces who shot into crowds to disperse them. The protesters, mostly students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and young people, are getting `` 100 percent support'' from the public, the diplomat said. Prime Minister Tun Tin went on the radio Thursday to say that as promised, the government will urgently carry out economic reforms to boost living conditions. Reforms ca n't be implemented in the current violence, he said. It was the government's first hint of concessions since <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> assumed power in the impoverished nation of 38 million people. Diplomats say economic problems, caused by Ne Win's isolationist policies, are among the reasons for the uprising. With a per capita income of less than $ 200, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is one of the world's poorest nations. Inflation is soaring and the country has a foreign debt of $ 4 billion.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, apparently weary of the controversy and protests surrounding its recruiting at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, has decided to move off campus this year.

Many with sincere interest stayed away. For recruitment purposes, the entire process was inefficient, he said.

<HEAD>Suit Says Police Put Recorder in Victim's Casket</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police hoping to hear a murder confession put a tape recorder near a woman's body as she lay in her casket at a funeral home, according to a lawsuit filed by the former suspect in the case. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> contends it was improper for police to put the device in the casket of his girlfriend, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, in March 1986. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> `` had every right to expect complete privacy ... and did not expect or even envision such an act by a public servant,'' says the suit, filed Thursday. Police hoped <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> would confess to killing Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 24, when he paid his last respects, the suit says. Instead, the tape captured comments that would have shown <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>'s innocence, and police then erased the recording, the suit contends. Police spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the department would not comment on pending litigation. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> died 11 days after she suffered severe head injuries. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, 32, told police she had jumped from his moving van during an argument, but police said she had been beaten to death. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> was charged with first-degree murder in May 1986. He was held without bond until February 1987, when the state attorney's office dropped the charge A medical examiner said Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> could have fallen from the van, and prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to bring <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> to trial. The lawsuit also says the investigation into Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s death was tainted because a police detective made false statements in the arrest affidavit and withheld evidence favorable to <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Outlawed Tribal Group Agrees To End 10-year Insurgency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An outlawed tribal group today agreed to end its 10-year-old campaign for an independent homeland in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>, a government official announced. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> signed a memorandum of understanding with federal and state governments, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s interior minister, <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, said in Parliament. Under the agreement, worked out in three months of negotiations, the insurgents agreed to surrender their weapons within a month and abide by the Constitution. In return, the tribal group will be given 20 seats in the new state legislature. The chief minister of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Majumder </PERSON>, said the accord would bring peace and stability to the state, bordering <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Authorities estimate nearly 600 died during the insurgency. The problem started in 1951 with a steady influx of settlers from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The economic and social patterns in the state shifted when the tribe members who originally settled the area were outnumbered. In the 1970s, tribal unrest gave rise to the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION>, which declared `` Independent Tripura'' as its objective and took up arms. The violence escalated, and in June 1980, nearly 400 people, mostly non-tribals, were massacred. The group set up its underground headquarters in the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tracts </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and started training volunteers. In April 1983, the leader of the underground movement, <PERSON> Bijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrangkhawl </PERSON>, rejected suggestions by then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> for a negotiated settlement between the organization and the state government. In 1984, the organization was outlawed. But the violence continued. In January, 97 people were killed. Non-tribals threatened retaliation, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> vowed to disrupt scheduled state elections, prompting the federal government to deploy the army. The elections were held a month later despite the threats, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wrested control of the state from the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In May, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> said they were willing to negotiate a settlement.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman today denounced House-passed legislation to withdraw all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment from racially segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, while supporter announced a campaign to ensure its passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the bill would `` destroy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s flexibility'' to seek change through diplomatic pressure. `` Such moves are more likely to stymie progress toward ending apartheid rather than to accelerate its end,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The House on Thursday adopted, on a 244-132 vote, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sanctions bill, which also would impose a near-total trade embargo. The bill faces threats of a Republican filibuster and a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. Supporters hailed the dramatic measure as a last-chance opportunity to bring strong economic pressure to bear to help end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system of racial separation by expanding the less sweeping sanctions adopted in 1986. But Republicans said the bill represents a `` scorched earth'' policy that amounts to declaring economic war against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a war they said would hurt the blacks it is designed to help by causing millions to lose their jobs. `` Apartheid is a morally wrong and politically unacceptable system which is the root cause of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s disorder,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` However, the imposition of sanctions is not the solution,'' he said. `` Sanctions would hurt the very people that we seek to help. They would destroy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s flexibility, discard our diplomatic leverage and deepen the crisis.'' Groups supporting the bill told a news conference they still lack the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto but believe they could get it signed by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he is elected. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON>, legal counsel to Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., said proponents were meeting with key <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides today to discuss strategy for the Sept. 8 debate of the sanctions bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee <PERSON> Damu </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which has lobbied for an end to apartheid, said his organization will intensify a grass-roots campaign against a threatened <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> filibuster. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members called on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to reverse course and adopt a policy of `` black empowerment'' to increase the economic and political power of blacks and weaken the foundations of the apartheid system. But Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, D-Mich., and other sanctions supporters said that course simply will not work `` Black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is an impossibility,'' <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted down a trio of Republican-sponsored amendments designed to dilute or change the legislation. With the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> eager to adjourn for the fall elections, little time remains to push the bill through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, especially since both houses likely would be faced with votes to override a presidential veto. In a policy statement, the administration said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s senior advisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if it emerges from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in its present form because it `` undermines the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.'' It was likely that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponents of the measure would launch a filibuster, since there is no limit on discourse in that chamber. Opponents have refused in the past to agree voluntarily to limit discussion on such issues, forcing the chamber to a cloture vote to shut off debate, a vote that requires the support of a two-thirds majority. Many Republican opponents accused the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership of staging a political vote to score points among black voters for Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and for political activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the eve of the Republican National Convention. `` Some of us wonder if the real purpose of this bill is to be responsive to the Jackson-Dukakis foreign policy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mich </LOCATION>. `` We are not bringing this bill to embarrass Republicans,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., principal sponsor of the `` We are here to free black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. This has nothing to do with presidential politics.'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said White House officials, citing ongoing peace negotiations in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, had asked him repeatedly over the last several days not to bring up the bill until after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from its Labor Day recess. He said he agreed to do so, but only if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised in writing not to veto the bill if it reached his desk. <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said that in the end, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> declined to make such a promise and he decided to go ahead. In an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from his colleagues, <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>: `` I listened to those who said this is going to hurt blacks, it's going to hurt corporations. But human beings will struggle for their freedom, in peace if they can, in violence if they must. ... That pales every single argument you have made. We must end the madness of apartheid.'' The disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economic sanctions voted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and still in effect. They banned all new public and private loans and investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and barred certain imports and exports. The bill contains these major provisions: _ All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be banned and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations with such investments would be compelled to divest them The investment ban would not apply to any business in which blacks or other non-whites have at least a 90 percent ownership interest. _ All South African imports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be banned except for certain strategic minerals and publications The 1986 sanctions law banned only agricultural products, coal, textiles, uranium, and military vehicles. _ All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be prohibited with the exception of agricultural products, publications and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public and private assistance _ The bill bars a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company or vessel from transporting crude or refined oil to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Americans also would be forbidden to engage in the production of nuclear material in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 A time bomb planted by suspected Sikh radicals exploded today on the roof of a state-owned bus, police said, and at least seven people were killed and 35 injured. The bomb exploded late this afternoon, 20 minutes after the vehicle left the crowded bus terminal at <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> for the town of <LOCATION> Shazadpur </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state, police chief Surinder <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Brar </PERSON> said. Almost at the same time, police detected and defused another time bomb planted in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>'s most popular shopping center, <PERSON> Brar </PERSON> said. Both bombs are suspected to have been planted by Sikh militants, he added. <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> is the joint capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> states. A separatist campaign by Sikh insurgents in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> has killed 1,680 people this year. `` It was an encounter with death,'' said <PERSON> Yash </PERSON> <PERSON> Bir </PERSON>, a passenger on the bus who suffered burn injuries in the explosion. `` I was unconscious. I do not know who brought me to hospital.'' <PERSON> Bir </PERSON> spoke to reporters from a bed in a <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> hospital, where most of the injured were taken. Doctors said five were in serious condition. The victims were not immediately identified. <PERSON> Brar </PERSON> said the bomb was planted on the bus' rooftop luggage carrier. About 70 passengers were in the vehicle when the bomb exploded, he said. In other parts of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikh militants were blamed for five other killings that occurred Thursday night and today, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. At least three victims were Sikhs, the news agency said. The militants have targetted members of the Hindu community and moderate Sikhs in their campaign. Sikhs form only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but form a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Radicals have been agitating for an independent Sikh homeland since 1982, claiming discrimination by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who form 80 percent of the population.

 The 120-member crew of an offshore vessel surrendered command of the ship after taking it over early today in a labor dispute, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> seamen's union said. J.G. <PERSON> Harmsen </PERSON> said the incident, in which the Spanish crew of the Dutch-owned <PERSON> Hermod </PERSON> seized command from Dutch officers for three hours, ended peacefully after a misunderstanding about the weeklong dispute was cleared up. Earlier today, the captain of the Hermod, which hauls heavy rig equipment for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> offshore oil industry, issued a distress call requesting navy assistance because of the mutiny, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Apparently there were some violent threats towards the commanding officers,'' the spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Geneste </PERSON> said. It was unclear whether the Dutch officers had been locked up during the incident. <PERSON> Harmsen </PERSON> said the crew was on strike for a week when it seized power today. He said that early in the day, the captain asked the crew to suspend its strike and weigh anchor in light of worsening weather conditions in the area where the vessel was operating, 100 miles northwest of this Dutch navy port. `` The crew failed to understand that the captain asked this because of safety reasons,'' <PERSON> Harmsen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` They thought it was another company ploy.'' <PERSON> Harmsen </PERSON> said the leaders of the mutiny abandoned their action after he explained the purpose of the captain's request by ship-to-shore radio. `` The whole incident was based on a misunderstanding,'' <PERSON> Harmsen </PERSON> said, adding that the strike had not been called off. The Hermod is owned by the Dutch offshore construction company <ORGANIZATION> Heerema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Ria </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kok </PERSON> refused to comment on the incident but said the request for navy assistance had been withdrawn. The labor dispute on board the <PERSON> Hermod </PERSON> and several other vessels involves <ORGANIZATION> Heerema </ORGANIZATION>'s lay-off procedures. The majority of the company's 950 Spanish sailors have short-term labor contracts and are not protected by Dutch labor law. The sailors are demanding better conditions in dismissal cases, according to <PERSON> Harmsen </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> took the oath of office today as the nation's 76th attorney general, declaring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must consider drugs and drug-trafficking `` Public Enemy No. 1.'' With President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> standing at his side in the Roosevelt Room of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would use `` every resource of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, consistent with strict observance of the civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens, to fight other unique threats to our traditional values.'' But he said, `` I believe that unless we sustain a vigorous effort to make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1, we could well stunt significantly the capacity of today's young people to contribute to a better quality of life for tomorrow's <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Shortly after his confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he was not counting on keeping the job if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> becomes president. `` I look on this as a six-month assignment,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said after an 85-0 vote confirmed him as successor to the controversial <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The oath of office was administered to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended the swearing-in ceremony. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, held the Bible while he said the oath. The former GOP <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor said in a television interview, aired in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, that he'll `` let the future take care of itself'' even if Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 56, already has told senators that he's a loyalist to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, declaring last week, `` His agenda is my agenda.'' Last week, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that fighting the `` scourge of narcotics'' would be his top priority, but he also promised a vigorous battle against organized crime, public corruption and white-collar crime. Thursday, he said `` every day'' of his potentially short tenure `` will be important, because the process of law enforcement is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day a week, year-round proposition and I'm anxious and enthusiastic about getting on the job. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> likely will be able to concentrate solely on department programs, unlike <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who spent considerable time defending his personal conduct. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical behavior was investigated by Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who concluded that the attorney general `` probably'' broke the law. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> consistently denied that, and maintained that the department was running normally despite defections by top aides during his final months as attorney general. Three other nominees for top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> positions were less fortunate Thursday than <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> quit for the summer without acting on them. Several senators used parliamentary maneuvering to block action unless the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> first took up legislation to enforce a treaty against genocide. The genocide legislation was not considered. The lack of action, however, is not likely to have a major effect on department operations since all three already are serving in acting capacities: <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> as deputy attorney general; <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> II as associate attorney general; and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as chief of the criminal division. `` We almost worked out something, but at the last moment we were unsuccessful,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> likely will vote on the three in September. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was supported enthusiastically by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s sharpest critics. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., attempted to paint a contrast between the two men He said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> attempted `` to roll back decades of progress in civil rights,'' gave `` favored treatment to friends'' and `` tarnished his high office.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, he said, `` will be an attorney general of a different and better mold. ... He will do as much as he can to repair the damage and injustices of the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> regime.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he admired <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s work as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The institute is named after the senator's brother `` Clearly, we have a superior nominee here,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> The attacks on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were lacking when Republicans spoke, but the praise for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was bipartisan. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has demonstrated the characteristics needed for the job: `` character, integrity, good judgment, competence and independence.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ran the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, and established the public integrity section that prosecutes corrupt public officials.

 Authorities stormed a house occupied by squatters Friday, arresting 67 people and seizing a bazooka and other weapons, police said. They said two officers were wounded. The arrests occurred after six policemen were injured Thursday in a raid on a neighboring house occupied by squatters. The squatters fled into an adjacent property, and police obtained a court order to search that house Friday. An earthmover was used to smash one wall after the squatters refused to leave. Police then entered the building and made the arrests. Reporters saw police dragging at least one person who was unconscious from the house. Police said they seized a bazooka, two pistols, bullets, knives and chains. The house seized by police Thursday was largely demolished during the night. Both properties are to be torn down for a small park.

<TEXT>
 Wholesale price inflation increased to an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, spurred by big boosts over a wide variety of products, including clothing, automobiles, furniture and poultry, the government said today. The increase came despite lower prices for beef, as the drought prompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burned-out pastures and higher feed prices. Just three days after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> initiated an increase in interest rates to fight inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in July, the same monthly increases as in May and March. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We would rather not see any increase in producer prices, but we still believe inflation remains low and under control.'' In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finished goods rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more than double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for all of 1987. Wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pace in July _ 0.4 percent _ than for goods overall, indicating to some analysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguing the farm belt were over. Food prices had been rising faster than prices for other products on the wholesale level since April. Overall energy prices, meanwhile, remained unchanged after a 1.6 percent drop in June, with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increase in gasoline prices offsetting a 6.1 percent decline in what distributors pay for home heating oil. Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices rose at 0.6 percent in July. Because food and energy prices are highly volatile from month to month, most analysts look to price changes for other products as a better indication of underlying inflation. Analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what they called an over-reaction in June to the drought. `` As expected, higher feed prices and burned-out pastures have sharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meat prices,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, director of economic forecasting at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said, fruit trees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing off their fruit early `` resulting in a temporary early supply of fruit.'' Wholesale prices in July fell 2.5 percent for beef, 10.5 percent for pork and 0.2 percent for soft drinks. They rose 2.3 percent for fruit, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in June, 7.5 percent for vegetables, 13.3 percent for bakery products, 2 percent for chickens and 20.3 percent for processed turkeys. <PERSON> Rataczak </PERSON> predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 as a result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiral upwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then. Price increases were widespread across a wide variety of non-food items. Men's clothing rose 0.9 percent, drugs were up 1.1 percent, cosmetics increased 1.7 percent and auto prices edged up 0.5 percent after a 1 percent decrease in June. The only non-food, non-energy consumer items for which wholesale prices fell last month were glassware, down 2.3 percent, and household flatware, down 0.4 percent. The July increase in finished goods overall put the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index at 108.5. That means a variety of goods costing $ 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost $ 108.50 last month, compared with $ 107.90 in June and $ 106.00 a year ago. Wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose 0.7 percent in July, indicating more inflation lies ahead despite the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Tuesday to boost the rate it charges banks for credit from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. Prices for intermediate goods, or those used in processing, had risen 0.9 percent in June. Analysts said the smaller July increase was due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before before <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed late in the monthy to a cease-fire. Excluding food and energy, prices for intermediate goods such as industrial chemicals, finished steel products, paper and synthetic fibers rose 0.7 percent overall. However, raw material prices fell 1.1 percent, with crude oil prices plummeting 9.3 percent. Corn prices soared 20 percent on the drought, but the increase was smaller than in June. Raw iron and steel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady for three months. Price changes on the retail level usually lag one to three months behind those at wholesale. Consumer price inflation has been averaging 4.4 percent for the past 18 months. July figures on consumer prices are to be published Aug. 23.

<HEAD>Meese Signs Order For Independent Counsels to Investigate Congress
Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> ended his controversial tenure at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today by signing an order that provides for independent counsels to investigate members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who has been investigated by two separate independent counsels since he came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1981, said his final act as attorney general will ensure that members of the legislative branch and top executive branch officials are treated in the same manner during federal criminal investigations. However, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s order established some differences. `` As many of you know, many people have long felt that there was an undesirable disparity between the way that members of the executive branch and members of the legislative branch were treated when it comes to allegations of criminal wrongdoing,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said at his final press conference. Under the order, if the attorney general receives specific and credible mation indicating that a senator or congressman has violated criminal law, he must launch a preliminary investigation of up to 90 days to see whether a special counsel should be named to conduct a full probe. Based on the results of the preliminary probe, the attorney general can either close the case or appoint a special independent counsel to investigate. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be treated similarly to top executive branch officials under the provisions of the Ethics in Government Act passed in 1978. In fact, the procedures will differ. For instance, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s order retained for future attorneys general the power to select any independent counsel to investigate members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the ethics act invests that appointment power in a special three-judge panel in cases involving top executive officials. Earlier in the administration, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> sought to have the act declared unconstitutional, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld it on June 29. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> argued that the law infringed on the president's power and resulted in unequal administration of justice because normal criminal cases were handled by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Even before the act was passed in 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had authority to hire special counsels to replace government attorneys in any case where the attorney general perceived a conflict for the government lawyers. This was done in the Watergate scandal. But as a result of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s order, `` the attorney general is required under this code of federal regulations to follow these procedures'' with respect to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who did not want his name used. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he had discussed the order with his successor, former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, though not with anyone on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> could rescind the order if he chose to. Lawmakers who have dealt with the independent counsel law have said they believe the act already applied to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Among those with this view are Reps. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee that reviews the law They quote the act as saying the attorney general may trigger an inquiry to determine whether an independent counsel should be appointed if he `` determines that an investigation or prosecution of the person ... by the attorney general or other officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> may result in a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the ethics in government law permitted him to sign the rule applying coverage to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but he waited until <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had been confirmed to shield him from any problems. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he had no idea why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not spell out that the law should cover its own members. But <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said his order will not apply to investigations that are currently under way. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to serve as a fellow at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank, and the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He also intends to hit the lecture circuit. While at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was investigated by independent counsel <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> on allegations that he may have used his office for personal gain. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> brought no charges against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. More recently, independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> investigated <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on allegations of conflict of interest and looked into his relationship with <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a lawyer who has been indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> is a defense contractor in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said last month that prosecution of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was unwarranted, although the attorney general probably violated tax and conflict-of-interest laws. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> harshly criticized <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s comments and said the special counsel's report vindicated him. At his news conference, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said neither he nor anyone at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would have helped <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> secure government contracts if they had known <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was a `` nest of criminals.'' `` I would not have had anything to do with it,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won an extension today of a temporary court order barring a businessman from selling or distributing videotapes of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech to the Democratic National Convention. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> extended the temporary order until Tuesday when he said he planned to issue a written opinion on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lawsuit seeking to permanently bar MPI Home Video from selling or distributing the videotape. `` I'm pleased with the result,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s attorneys. But <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said he expected the lawsuit would be heard in a trial unless the two sides reach some type of settlement. <PERSON> Waleed </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the suburban businessman who sold the videotapes of the former presidential contender's convention speech, testified Thursday that he was motivated by money and the event's historic importance. `` I thought we had a hot-seller,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> in suburban Oak Forest, acknowledged during the hearing that he had never obtained permission to sell the tapes from the former presidential candidate. But attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> contend the company did n't need <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s authorization because his hourlong speech July 19 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was a news event, unprotected by federal copyright law <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s attorneys have argued that <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> legitimately purchased <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the speech from the network for $ 6,500. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said that while viewing the speech live on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, he knew it was newsworthy and worth preserving for historic reasons. `` Our position is that it is news,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> testified. `` You admit that Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> never authorized you to make this tape?'' asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>. `` Absolutely,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> testified. `` I do n't have any arrangement with the Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' The 60-minute tape, `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: We Can Dream Again,'' is comprised of uncut <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> coverage, including commercials and camera shots of the convention floor, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said that until a July 29 temporary restraining order barred the sale and distribution of the tape until today, his firm had shipped about 7,100 cassettes, at a list price of $ 14.95 each. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who did not appear in court Thursday, testified last week that <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION>'s tape `` has hurt our ability to make a living off my work.'' He said he reaped $ 100,000 four years ago from marketing a videotape of his speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and that <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION>'s distribution of this year's speech has cut into its market potential.

 Republican platform writers wrangled over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today as they strived to wrap up their pre-convention work on a document that highlights <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experience. The 106-member platform committee looked for ways to avoid a divisive fight over deployment of the Star Wars anti-missile system after finishing with the domestic portion of the 30,000-word document Thursday. But it was Southern Africa that sparked an early fight between more militant committee members and those pushing the views of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. First the committee agreed to denounce <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: `` Republicans deplore the apartheid system of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and consider it morally repugnant.'' But then the committee turned back a series of amendments designed to blame communists for many of the problems in that troubled region. For example, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wanted to specify that all Communist troops should leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, rather than all foreign troops, the phrase pushed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces. `` If it looks like a Red and talks like a Red ... let's call it a Communist,'' he said. But Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, head of the foreign policy subcommittee, argued against any changes: `` Words are delicate. Written comments can not be retracted.'' Summers' proposal was rejected as was language offered to condemn the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a key group fighting the South African government. `` It's a communist group,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> `` Bay'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the amendment's sponsor. <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> said he agreed with the sentiments, but said any change `` can cause problem with respect to the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces did accept an amendment opposing `` the maintenance of communist forces in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>.'' Today's session, focused on the 60 pages of defense and foreign policy language, began with praise for Republican nominee-to-be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and criticism of Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` There is one person who can fill the full measure of the awesome charge of being president _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The grim truth is, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, that the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training.'' The Oval Office phrase is in the platform itself. Foreign policy is an area that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> views as a strength in his battle against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> BIll </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> denounced as `` pure political hogwash'' rhetoric from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not been deeply involved in foreign policy. `` We have a candidate who has been more involved in foreign policy ... than anyone who has ever run for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> said. There was a bitter tangle on AIDS on Thursday, but the committee members, while dissenting on a variety of issues, chose not to disturb <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hopes for a peaceful convention with floor fights on the platform. `` I doubt very much that there will be any floor fights,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, co-chairman of committee. `` The moderates in our party have had a significant impact on the newer issues in the platform.'' Earlier today, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, interviewed on `` CBS This Morning,'' said, `` We're a conservative political party. We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the ` c' word.'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said, however, the document will reflect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans for `` a new direction in education, in environment, in child care.'' `` The vice president came here in an unprecedented event and spoke to this platform committee and tried to give them that direction, so that this really will truly be a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> platform,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee will meet again Monday afternoon, after the opening session of the convention, to take a final vote before the convention faces the issues on Tuesday. One possible fight today looms over when to deploy President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars plan, formally called the Strategic Defense Initiative. Strong Star Wars backers, led by <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, pushed through a change earlier this week to make the platform call for `` rapid and certain deployment'' of SDI. But former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman on defense, told reporters that the platform would reflect the original draft language, calling for deployment as soon as feasible. `` I do n't think we should begin the program by acting too precipitously,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> vowed a fight at the committee against any changes. `` My understanding is that the vice president is comfortable with the language,'' she said. Most of Thursday's session was peaceful, in sharp contrast to the heated debates earlier in the week on such topics as abortion. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> dropped his plans to press an amendment calling upon the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to back tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And a possibe floor fight was averted over abortion when moderates dropped plans to challenge a plank that says, `` We believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s pre-election debate on the future of the occupied territories is turning into a battle of the generals. The liberal Labor Party of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is reassessing policy based on the recommendations of retired military chiefs who believe giving back land may not jeopardize the nation's security But their positions are disputed by ex-generals aligned with the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. They argue that a smaller <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a more vulnerable <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Could we leave <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> -LRB- the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -RRB- and be safe? The answer is no,'' said retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> candidate for Parliament. The Nov. 1 elections may turn on whether <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voters are willing to risk giving up all or part of the 2,266 square miles of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 Middle East War. Much of the new thinking about the territories is coming from the liberal, Labor-oriented Council for Peace and Security, which includes among its members 30 major generals, 80 brigadier generals and 100 colonels. Spokesman <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON> says after four months of internal debates, the private think tank is getting ready to publish a series of papers on the military implications of giving up territory. <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON> said participants reached a consensus on four major points: _ Evacuated areas would become demilitarized, except possibly for some troops along the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. _ The <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would be the military frontier. _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force would control of the skies over any territory yielded to the Arabs. _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would maintain early warning stations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, perhaps existing bases, on 50-year leases. Retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> of the peace council said it could take years to establish adequate security safeguards. `` Our group believes territorial compromise can be achieved and defense arrangements can be made, even if they cover a long period of time,'' he said in an interview. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said a withdrawal plan was being drafted for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by a group of senior reserve officers headed by <PERSON> Avigdor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gal </PERSON>, a retired major general and leading figure in the peace council. It would replace a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> policy paper that envisioned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> holding onto the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and other strategic areas of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for security reasons. `` Under the previous plan, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would keep 50 to 60 percent of the territory. But in terms of security, we say it can give up to 100 percent if these conditions are met,'' <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON> said. He said the council has reached a consensus that a Palestinian state `` is not by itself a mortal threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' although this has become a slogan of the right. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, who has emerged as a leading <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on defense policy, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s defense strategy is built on its ability to mobilize reserve troops and the ooccupied land is needed to buy time for troops to get into position. He said maintaining the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as a defensive line allows <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to send troops to the frontier without being subject to attack in hostile areas of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in between. Some pro-withdrawal generals said accurate long-range missiles make it unnecessary to hold onto the territory as a buffer. But <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> said the extra time provided by territorial depth is more critical than ever. <PERSON> Alouph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hareven </PERSON>, a former intelligence colonel and leading figure in the peace council, said former generals will play a key role in selling the public on the need to get rid of the occupied lands. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public is not sentimentally attached to <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> or other areas of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. What matters to them is the security dimension,'' he said. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a former head of military intelligence, agreed voters would decide on the basis of security issues. But he said, `` Nobody sees an alternative to holding the territory right now.'' <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> `` Raful'' <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a former chief of staff and now a leading figure in the nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should annex all occupied land. `` We must annex all of -LRB- the territory -RRB- and massively settle every spare corner of the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a legislator, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> was forced to resign and <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> retired after a judicial commission criticized them for failing to prevent the massacre of Palestinians by Christian militiamen in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> camps of <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> in 1982.

 The leaders are <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> graduates who could be earning more than $ 100,000 a year. The participants are high school and college students who could be at the beach. Instead, they're working as a sort of urban Peace Corps that organizers hope will set a national example The program, called City Year, is a privately funded community service project. Fifty students ages 18 to 21, from high school dropouts to <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, were culled from 150 applicants. They begin their days at 8 a.m. sharp on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Common with 20 minutes of calisthenics. If they're late, they do extra exercises. They spend the rest of the day on various projects, battling the summer's searing heat and humidity as well as urban blight. One day they sort surplus food in a warehouse, other days they help paint and renovate shelters for the homeless, clear brush from vacant lots or work with disabled children. `` We call it City Year, because we thought of it as being like junior year, senior year, then City Year,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 27, a recent <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate who is one of the group's directors `` We say, ` Why not spend a city year helping your city before going on to college?''' City Year ends this summer but organizers hope to get enough funding to make the program year-round. They plan to start it up again next year. <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, 17, said she's `` learned a lot about other people.'' She said she enjoyed working on a project with disabled children so much that she found it `` painful to leave.'' Though youth corps exist in other cities, City Year President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khazei </PERSON> said most of them are government-funded. <PERSON> Khazei </PERSON> began working on the program during his last year at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> with two other students and a fourth person from another college. They took their idea around to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s business community in the hope of receiving funding and were rewarded. <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and General Cinema each donated $ 25,000 to fund four of the five 10-person City Year teams. Citizen contributions funded the fifth team. `` One of the big issues with national service is how do you fund it?'' said <PERSON> Khazei </PERSON>. `` Well, we've reached out to the private sector to show it can be done.'' <PERSON> Khazei </PERSON> said he and his colleagues prefer working to `` promote the idea of national service'' rather than taking high-paying corporate jobs. `` This is a lot more fun,'' he said. `` We love what we're doing. I ca n't think of anything more rewarding than working with wonderful young people.'' <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON>, 27, a Brown graduate, is one of the individual team leaders. Because she knows sign language, the two hearing-impaired participants were assigned to her team. `` When I read the -LRB- program -RRB- proposal, I said, ` This is it, this is what I have to do to make a difference,''' she said. <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON> said the highlight of her team's work came on a recent sweltering day at a shelter for the homeless. The students spent the day on the third floor of the shelter reupholstering chairs for the women in the shelter. `` Each of them got to carry a chair down to the women at the end of the day,'' said <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON>. `` When the women saw the chairs, they all cheered. It was such a high.'' A stint spent working at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for disabled children was the high point for many of the students. <PERSON> Winda </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, 17, who is deaf, said it was a revelation to her to care for children with greater disabilities than herself. `` It was my favorite place,'' she said. `` I loved it. I di n't want to leave I made so many friends.'' <PERSON> Caleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson-Sive </PERSON>, 17, a prep school student, said that prior to City Year, he `` might have avoided people like the ones there. But I look at handicapped people totally differently now. This -LRB- City Year -RRB- has changed my outlook on a lot of things.''

<HEAD>East Germany Praises Role of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Friday hailed the `` positive effects'' of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, where 77 people have been killed in attempted escapes to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> since it was erected in 1961. On the eve of the wall's 27th anniversary, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published a lengthy article repeating long-standing allegations that the 13-foot barrier had blocked a planned attack from the West. Under a headline reading `` For peace, for socialism,'' the Neues Deutschland newspaper recalled the start of the wall's construction on Aug. 13, 1961. `` From then on, positive effects have continued up until today and will continue in the future,'' it said. `` The summer Sunday 27 years ago stands in close relation to the struggle for the maintentance and strengthening of peace, security and cooperation on our continent,'' the newspaper added. East German border guards hastily began erecting the wall through downtown <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, dividing the city East and West when the flow of refugees to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> became so great it threatened to cripple the communist nation's economy. Today, armed East German guards with shoot-to-kill orders patrol the wall around the clock. Floodlights illuminate it at night. <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> said that in 1961, `` the Western powers used hysteria and an open threat of military force as the answer to the proposals of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Socialist countries for the assurance of peace and the resolution of the anomalous situation in <LOCATION> Berlin-West </LOCATION>.'' The paper said there were plans at the time for a `` forcible change of the status quo.'' `` The attack was tried out in a series of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> maneuevers, and troop readiness areas were drawn up,'' the paper said. The August 13th Working Group, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> organization that monitors human rights in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, says the number of people who have been killed in escape attempts is 77. The last reported death came on May 23, 1987, when a lifeless body was carried away from the wall on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> side. <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON>, the head of the August 13th group, told a news conference on Friday: `` The shoot-to-kill orders are still in effect at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and on the boundary between the two German states.'' The orders reportedly have been temporarily suspended at times, for example during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Maik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohr </PERSON>, a former East German soldier who fled to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in May, said he estimated that 90 percent of those who want to flee to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are apprehended before they can make an attempt. He said special security units track potential escapees by watching for unusually large bank withdrawals or sales of personal possessions.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo threatened Friday to crack down on student demonstrations to safeguard the Olympics. Radicals on six campuses hurled firebombs and rocks at police, who fired tear gas. `` An eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs, stones and tear gas during the Olympics would disrupt the Olympics, and our nation would become an object of worldwide scorn,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a meeting reviewing preparations for the games, scheduled to begin Sept. 17. Also Friday, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to meet at the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> in one week to discuss the possibility of full parliamentary talks on easing tension on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. About 6,000 radical students from 22 universities held rallies or staged violent street demonstrations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and six provincial cities, protesting a police blockade of a march to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for unification talks. The march is planned for Monday. Riot police fired tear gas to drive students back at six campuses. Witnesses reported some arrests and injuries, but police declined to give any figures. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said 2,099 radicals were detained Wednesday and Thursday for taking part in demonstrations to support the march. It said all but 243 were released. Riot police continued to ring college campuses and stand guard at government buildings to try to foil preparations for the march to the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> border truce site. The government banned the march and police have mounted a major security effort to block it. Police officials said students have attacked 13 police stations around the country this week, and several dozen officers were injured. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> accused radical students of trying to overthrow the government and siding with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to be a co-host of the Olympics, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> appealed to opposition leaders <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, who attended the Olympic briefing, to dissuade radical students from the march and violent protests. The opposition promised support for the Olympics but stressed the need for dialogue between the government and student leaders. `` It is deplorable that a small number of dissidents and radical students are huring a successful Olympic mood with demonstrations and calls for joint Olympics,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sought the meeting on tension-easing measures for Wednesday, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> counterproposed Friday. The two-day delay apparently is aimed at protecting celebrations of the `` Olympic Mood'' on Wednesday, 30 days before the start of the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has called for a meeting of the two countries' legislatures to discuss its bid to become a co-host of the Olympics and draft a non-aggression pact The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evren </PERSON> approved a constitutional amendment Friday to allow earlier municipal elections, opening the way for a national referendum on the issue. The amendment, backed only by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, passed 284-95 in the 450-seat legislature a week ago. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 1982 Constitution, written under military rule, requires at least five years between local elections. That meant local elections could not be held in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> before March 1989. The amendment calls for local elections nationwide on Nov. 13. But the nation must vote on any constitutional amendment adopted by fewer than 300 votes in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The referendum is expected to take place Sept. 25. Political analysts say the governing party wants early polls partly because they do not want to give the main opposition Social Democrats time to organize under new leadership.

<TEXT>
 The light sheen of oil left by a ruptured barge in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was drifting away from barrier islands on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and should eventually evaporate, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` The situation is definitely improving,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>. At one point Thursday, the oil slick had threatened to wash onto the beaches of Ship and Cat islands about 10 miles off the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> mainland. An estimated 5,000 gallons of oil leaked from the barge after it struck a submerged barge early Thursday a few miles off the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coast. The submerged barge, which was loaded with scrap iron, had sunk Monday during the rough seas of Tropical Storm Beryl. <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said 10,000 barrels of oil was pumped from damaged areas of the oil barge onto another vessel Thursday night, allowing the barge to float free. It was moved away from the site of the accident and was no longer leaking oil, he said. The patches of oil remaining from the leak were too light to be skimmed from the water, but the sun and wind should evaporate most of the crude as it drifts out to sea, <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said. `` We talked with the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> and they said there was very little potential for major environmental damage due to the oil,'' <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has selected Army Lt. Gen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> to become the next head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the military arm responsible for all American forces in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Assuming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> would replace Marine Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, whose tenure has included more than a year of tanker escorts by American warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> as well as combat clashes between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian forces. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> is to step down from his command on Nov. 23 and retire. <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>'s selection had been widely rumored for several weeks, ever since <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources disclosed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had rebuffed pleas by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to install an admiral as <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>'s successor. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustin </PERSON>, the deputy chief of naval operations, plans, policy and operations, was the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s candidate. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that he will retire on Sept. 1 after more than 33 years of active service. When the Central Command was originally created as the follow-on to the <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deployment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of the Carter administration, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials decided the commanding general should rotate between the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in case troops had to be sent in. At the time, the biggest threat to peace in the region was considered the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which was viewed as having designs on the oil supplies that are crucial to the West. But then the Iran-Iraq war erupted and expanded to the waters of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided last year to escort reflagged Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway. That prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to begin arguing for a naval expert in the top job. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> finally intervened in the matter, deciding even before the recent cease-fire agreement between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to stick with the original rotation plan. <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>, 53, now is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy chief of staff for operations and plans and the senior <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

 Bourbon Street has always appealed to the prurient, but French Quarter merchants have draped <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' famous party street with red, white and blue to attract the patriotic as well during the Republican National Convention <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags hang next to drawings of bare breasted women beckoning to passers-by while multicolored bunting competes for attention with a fake pair of women's legs that swing forward and back from two stories above. On this naughty street of take-out drinks and knockout strip shows, merchants are hoping to lure Republicans with traditional tawdriness and newfound politics. `` He's tan, rested and ready _ <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1988'' adorns one T-shirt bearing a black and white likeness of the former president. Other shirts found in various souvenir shops carry the standard logo of the official 1988 GOP convention. Bourbon Street is ready for the Republicans. The question, however, is are the Republicans ready for Bourbon Street? `` Everybody should see this city,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` There are lots of weirdos here, but everyone should see them. It's hot, but excellent.'' Wrought-iron balconies, bars named for pirates, provocative dancers of both sexes and 24-hour liquor attract an eclectic group. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Montolbano </PERSON>, the doorman at <ORGANIZATION> Pat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Briens </ORGANIZATION> where tourists slurp rosy-colored Hurricanes in a glass they can take home, said some Republicans have already experienced the street. `` You can spot ` em by the way they dress in those $ 800 suits and the way they carry themselves. Power tie, power look, the whole bit,'' he said. Dancer <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said she expects the Republicans to party just like everyone else. `` If they get drunk, they should spend money. There's going to be a lot of men at this convention, they said, so it'll be good for us,'' she said. The doorman at Papa <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s, which bills itself as having the only female impersonators on Bourbon Street, said Republicans seem to enjoy looking at men dressed up like women. `` They seem to be having fun. At least they get a couple of laughs out of here,'' said <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreland </PERSON>. But a hostess at the Coffee Pot, around the corner from <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, and a bartender at Court Liquors To Go said they've noticed little change _ yet. The French Quarter, of course, is not the only place <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> likes to party. `` A Grand Party for the Grand Old Party'' started the convention festivities on Friday with a picnic in <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Probably the only family event scheduled for the week, the Grand Party featured bands, choirs, fireworks and free rides on the park's narrow-gauge trains and flying horses, a turn-of-the-century carousel. The Elephant Romp on Saturday will attract delegates and people willing to shell out $ 100 per person for a trip to the Audubon Zoo. The <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> hopes to raise $ 400,000 to help defray city costs for hosting the convention. Tents featuring <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> themes, food and music will be spread about the zoological park. Beginning Sunday, fancy clothes and political bigwigs will dominate the many private parties on social calendars. Among those featured convention week are a masked ball for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> insiders at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> featuring comedian and impersonator <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate tycoon <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has accepted an invitation to a jazz brunch at the home of <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> for 30 of his Fortune 500 counterparts.

 <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> rose to prominence by personally killing a Burmese rebel leader in 1950 and commanding an army company that shot down rioting <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students in 1962. When thousands of students went on a rampage last March in some of the worst riots <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has experienced, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> led the forces that stopped them. Analysts had suggested the 64-year-old former general would be a logical scapegoat as the government of Ne Win, his close ally, sought to appease critics and stabilize the country. Instead, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> emerged last month as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful leader to succeed Ne Win, who resigned after wielding near absolute power since a coup 26 years ago. Protests of authoritarian rule intensified this week and soldiers killed at least 95 demonstrators. Protesters carried placards calling <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> a `` dog, Nazi and butcher of students,'' and many Burmese said he was the most hated man in the country. On Friday, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned as president of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and chairman of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Little has been published about <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and others in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s senior hierarchy, most of whom live in seclusion According to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Badgley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> is a Mon tribesman born in <LOCATION> Mattama </LOCATION> village. The <LOCATION> Mons </LOCATION> are one of several ethnic minorities in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country. He completed the fourth grade at most in a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monastery school. Many Burmese still look down on him for his low level of education and relative lack of manners. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> joined the army in 1942 when <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> officers, including Ne Win, were siding with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> against the Allies _ specifically <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, colonial master of the former kingdom. As the war progressed, the officers switched allegiance, realizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was as much a threat to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s independence as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Independence in 1948 was followed by a chaotic, 14-year experiment with democracy. Maj. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> became known during that period as the man who cornered and killed <PERSON> Sabaw </PERSON> <PERSON> U </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, leader of the ethnic <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebellion. He developed a reputation as a man with courage and decisiveness, but limited vision and a strain of brutality. Among the troops, his nickname was `` chinthe,'' for the mythical lion that guards the entrances of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. He once was Ne Win's personal aide, and was at the leader's side when Ne Win seized power in 1962 and began enforcing his brand of economic socialism, military-backed authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the world. Soon after the coup, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> led his army unit in quelling the riots at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, firmly establishing his reputation as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out opposition. Most Burmese are interested in the supernatural, but <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> has a preoccupation with astrology, magic and black arts and for three years was the secret publisher of a magazine called Veda dealing with such matters, <ORGANIZATION> Badgley </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> retired from the army and in 1977 joined the party's Central Executive Committee He won the No. 4 party post of joint general secretary in 1985 and also became secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 position in the government after president and vice president. He has held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives, transport, communications, and home affairs. On March 18, a day later dubbed `` Bloody Friday,'' thousands of students swept through downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, burning cars and shouting anti-government slogans. It was the second student outburst in three months. The `` Lon Htein,'' or riot police, were called out, reinforced by regular army units and armored vehicles. Western diplomats and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> commanded the police from a tactical headquarters at the government broadcast station. They said he overruled some leaders who wanted to be more lenient. The government has acknowledged 43 deaths, but more than 100 people are believed to have been killed.

 Three members of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government team taking part in a nuclear testing experiment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> engaged in `` some unauthorized souvenir collection'' there, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, however, said that based on information available so far to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, `` we do n't believe it was intelligence activity of any kind. `` The individuals picked up and attempted to ship on for their personal use some rock samples, a piece of barbed wire, an <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> wrench and a hammer,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the White House. `` The individuals involved have been removed from the list of those who might return for the experiment,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that the team was in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the auspices of an agreement, announced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, for a joint verification experiment in the field of nuclear testing. `` We do n't believe it was intelligence activity of any kind, but it was a personal mistake on their part,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that `` we have informed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of this, yes.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to divulge the names of the three people involved. The team apparently was under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said only that it included geologists who were there to work with rocks and minerals related to the experiment. The materials were discovered by Soviets inspecting equipment crates being prepared for shipment back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Deputy Press Secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had issued a formal diplomatic protest over the July 17 incident. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there had been no formal exchanges. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told the newspaper that both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were trying to resolve the problem in a `` low-key'' manner. The team was in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under an agreement by which the superpowers are allowing each other to observe and monitor each other's nuclear blasts. The agreement is not connected to the monitoring of weapons under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` There's no question but that we stepped over the bounds of the agreement,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified senior administration official as saying Thursday. The official said the incident presumably stemmed from an innocent mistake. The attempted shipment by the Americans, who were not identified, involved materials such as tools and wire associated with Soviet nuclear test preparations at the test site near <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> as well as soil and rock samples of potential use in assessing yields of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear blasts, the newspaper quoted officials as saying. The items were found by Soviet authorities during a search of a crate of personal belongings of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official and two employees of private firms under contract to the federal government, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Spokesmen for the departments of energy and state as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, has conducted a secret investigation of the incident. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for atomic energy and chairman of the military liaison to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the Americans were `` absolutely not'' deliberately trying to collect prohibited materials. When contacted late Thursday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> denied making the comment to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and refused to speak about the issue. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a private protest July 25 to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats that demanded permanent expulsion of the three and a detailed explanation, the newspaper reported. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official and one of the contractor employees had left the country before the protest was issued, and the other contractor employee was allowed to remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied he was responsible, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official not identified by the newspaper said, `` We are trying to resolve it in a low-key way ... and the Soviets are, too.'' The special nuclear experiment for which the team was in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is scheduled for next month at the test site near <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION>. The Post quoted unidentified senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying the incident was not expected to halt the progress of the agreement, which also calls for observation of tests at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> site in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The project in question was part of the Joint Verification Experiment concerning nuclear testing and `` has nothing to do with on-site inspection or the INF Treaty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night.

 A forest fire fanned by gusty wind has closed one road to Old Faithful geyser in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and firefighters today faced dozens of lightning-started fires in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Fire burning underground in a peat bog in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state bedeviled firefighters and choked a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb with smoke. `` You're walking along and it looks like solid ground and then you fall three feet into hot coals,'' said <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON>, a volunteer at <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` It's like standing in a barbecue pit.'' Forest and brush fires also burned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. A grass fire in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> was contained and firefighters controlled a lightning-sparked grass fire that burned up to 15,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> panhandle. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the 40,000-acre North Fork fire jumped across the road north of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION> and authorities said the road probably would open and close periodically with increased fire activity. The geyser was still accessible from the south. Extra crews of firefighters were assigned to the blaze as it moved eastward, bringing the force up to 700 people. `` The fire has been moving very fast, is burning very hot and putting up a large column of smoke,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. The column of smoke was between 35,000 and 40,000 feet high Thursday afternoon. About 2,000 firefighters were working on fires that had burned about 196,000 acres of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> as of Thursday. Flames quieted down enough on the 34,000-acre Shoshone and Red fires in the park to allow officials to reopen the majority of the approximately 400 spaces at the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> campground today, <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. A thunderstorm that swept through <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Thursday dotted the state's forests and rangelands with flame. Estimates of the number of fires jumped from 50 to 75 Thursday night as dispatchers received more reports. The Walker Creek fire on the <ORGANIZATION> Caribou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> forced the evacuation of about 16 families from their homes on Indian <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Inkom </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The 3,000-acre blaze was believed contained Thursday but wind gusting to 25 mph pushed the flames over lines and toward the homes. Crews in the <ORGANIZATION> Challis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> worked to create a buffer between the 13,500-acre Battleaxe wilderness fire and a guard station and a private airstrip about a mile to the south. Smoke from the peat bog fire at <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, combined with patchy fog, has caused morning commuter traffic problems and road closures, and the stench has choked residents and dairy cows. An irrigation sprinkler was used to apply 35,000 gallons of water an hour, cooling the ground so firefighters could walk on it and use hoses to spray the smoldering peat as it was exposed by bulldozers and backhoes. `` It's so hot out there you're pants will catch on fire. It will get in your boots,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a volunteer firefighter from Carnation. Police Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> said visibility was so low in the smoke Thursday morning that he could n't see a patrol car with flashers working more than six feet away. `` It's like driving into a brick wall,'' <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> said. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> controlled a lightning-caused blaze after it charred 1,800 acres of brush with 50-foot-high flames in the outskirts of <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that forced about 200 people to briefly evacuate their homes. Crews in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> worked today to cut fire lines through the steep <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to battle the Warm Springs Creek fire. The fire has burned some 2,500 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, about 15 miles southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, and fire information officer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said elevations in the fire area ranged from 5,800 feet to 8,500 feet. An out-of-control fire fueled by heavy brush and pushed by strong, erratic wind put more than 1,300 firefighters to the test in the <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> early today, burning more than 2,000 acres, officials said. The fire destroyed two cabins and threatened others in steep terrain about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>.

 A mental hospital Friday abandoned plans to take <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on a field trip after the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> turned up a new cache of writings by the man who shot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seven years ago. The decision by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> was announced at a hearing originally convened by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to consider the plan to allow <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> to join other patients on a supervised outing. But letters by <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> found this week during an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> prompted hospital officials to drop their request. Based on `` recent materials received'' Thursday night, the hospital `` determined that further clinical assessment by Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s treatment staff is necessary before it would permit him to participate in such an off-grounds activity,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, reading from a letter sent to the judge. `` The hospital no longer plans to include Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> in the upcoming recreational activity in the community,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s forensic services unit, added. Comments during the hearing by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and defense lawyer <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> indicated that the writings were letters <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> had sent to an unidentified third party. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said he would not grant <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>' request to release the writings, which prosecutors had placed under court seal Thursday night, until <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> had a chance to file an objection. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> may have some `` proprietary interest'' in the writings that would prevent them from being released. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who wore a sport jacket and tie, sat impassively throughout the brief hearing. The White House declined comment. `` We have never taken a position on <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> matters, and we wo' t now,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> Outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said he would continue his efforts to make the writings public because `` they relate to a matter of great national importance, they relate to an individual who shot the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The public should be aware of what these materials are,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said, indicating that the writings figured directly in the hospital's decision the request to take <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> on a field trip. `` We provided materials to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> last night; they withdrew their request for an off-site visit this morning,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. The decision also came after federal prosecutors cited `` disturbing entries'' made this week in <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s treatment record at the hospital. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, 33, has been confined to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> since he was acquitted by reason of insanity of shooting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and two other men on March 30, 1981. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was shot in the head, remains confined to a wheelchair and has difficulty speaking as a result of the injuries he suffered. Hospital officials had not formally outlined its specific plan for the outing. But court records indicate the field trip may be a picnic or a party at a bowling alley. The hospital dropped a request in April 1987 to allow <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> to visit his parents during the Easter weekend after investigators turned up evidence he had traded letters with multiple murderer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who is held on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row. A psychiatrist testified last year that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> also had once received a letter from <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> `` Squeaky'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, who is imprisoned for trying to kill President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s correspondence with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and other writings seized from his room last year remain under court seal.

 Programmers hope a new software program that can print out music as it's played will score a hit with composers. `` You play, it prints. It's a speeding up of the whole process,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Borowicz </PERSON>, a co-creator of the program. `` It understands everything about standard music notation and it can accurately transcribe what you play.'' The program, called `` Finale'' by Coda Music Software of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, was unveiled Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Macworld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'88. The program can translate information from a keyboard, guitar or wind instrument. <PERSON> Borowicz </PERSON>, a composer and computer scientist, said he and his partner <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrand </PERSON> worked on musical transcription software for about five years before producing the program. The software, he said, costs $ 1,000 and is `` aimed at the professional level, or the intense amateurs.'' Although he said the new program will allow composers to produce more music in less time, some musicians were hesitant to applaud the new development. <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, the director of the New England Conservatory of Music's department of Third Stream Studies, said he was personally interested but questioned whether it was an appropriate tool for students. `` I wonder if they should n't have a mentor'' to teach them such intricacies as harmony, he said. Although word processing has advanced rapidly, music notation has benefited little from technology. Some software programs allow composers to print music by punching in notes on a computer staff, but the new program frees musicians from working separately on composing, performing and editing. The new program, <PERSON> Borowicz </PERSON> said, is `` works the way the musician works. The musician does not have to work the way the software works.'' Finale allows the musician to edit a piece at any point. `` You can play it back. You can stop it at any point. You can manipulate down to the micro level,'' <PERSON> Borowicz </PERSON> said. `` You can also point to the note, drag it to where you want it, or change it.''

 About 25,000 demonstrators, some lugging crosses, urged mass boycotts of `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' upon its release today, and at least one major theater chain has decided against showing the film. The movie opens in nine major cities at the height of a nationwide fundamentalist furor sparked by Christians who say it is blasphemous in its portrayal of a Jesus Christ tempted to abandon his divinity. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today, about two dozen demonstrators picketed in front of the Ziegfeld Theater, some shouting at the hundreds of film-goers who formed a line that wrapped around the block for a matinee showing. `` We see it as an attack on morality and traditional family values,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, who carried a sign reading, `` Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion.'' `` We feel these people who are mocking Christianity today would also be willing to mock Judaism.'' `` WarGames'' director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Badham </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> today in support of the film. `` We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity seekers,'' <PERSON> Badham </PERSON> said. `` What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the Bill of Rights.'' An estimated 25,000 protesters jammed the streets around <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, adding their voices to a chorus of protest that has stretched from the studio lot to the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of impressionable people who would see this ... will receive a totally skewed, biased, and blatantly false portrayal of the person who is nearest and dearest to our hearts _ our savior <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters decided against showing the movie after company executives screened it this week. The company _ the nation's fourth-largest movie chain with 1,338 screens in 318 locations _ offered no explanation for its decision. In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, newsletters and petitions are being circulated in churches urging their members to persuade theaters not to book the movie. The owners of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s two largest theater chains have said they will not show the film, as did the 44-screen <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chain in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> urged his archdiocese's Roman Catholics to boycott the film because it is `` morally offensive and repugnant to Christian belief. `` One way to be heard is by not going. Another way is to write the producers,'' Law wrote in the archdiocesan weekly paper. The movie, directed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> and distributed by Universal, opens to the public today in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. An invitation-only screening Thursday in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> drew about 30 peaceful protesters outside the theater. Last week, the studio suddenly advanced the release of the film by six weeks, giving its opponents less time to organize threatened boycotts and, perhaps, taking advantage of the current publicity. In Thursday's protest, buses carrying thousands of Christians rolled into the Universal parking lot, backing up traffic for a mile on the nearby <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> and on roads around the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. Many demonstrators lugged wooden crosses. Others, with children in tow, carried hand-printed signs reading `` Boycott Blasphemy'' and `` The Greatest Story Ever Distorted.'' Opponents of the film are enraged by <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s portrayal of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as an ambivalent savior. In a hallucination while dying on the cross, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> imagines abandoning his divinity to live as an ordinary man, and fantasizes about sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. Most of the film's antagonists have not seen `` Last Temptation'' and base their enmity on reports from the small number of clergy who have viewed it. <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> has defended his film, saying he wished to create a story that would provoke people to think about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a man confronting temptation. He said the film should be considered art translated from a novel, not an interpretation of the Gospels. The film is based on the 1955 novel by Greek author <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, the actor who portrays <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in the film, said today that he is baffled by protesters' complaints. `` No, I do n't understand, I do n't understand. I just think this is a beautiful, powerful, positive film.

 A letter from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was delivered to a top Soviet official Friday by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, and a Western official hinted the message concerned talks on the ballistic missile treaty. The Western official, speaking on the condition he not be identified by name or country, said that after handing over the letter, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> discussed the talks on the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The official, who was familiar with the meeting and the letter, hinted that the message from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also concerned the talks, scheduled to start Aug. 24 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> had delivered a letter to <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and said they discussed `` limiting nuclear and space arms, building on the talks held during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting.'' The Aug. 24 meeting is required under the ABM treaty, which calls on the two superpowers to hold a conference every five years to review its implementation. Disputes over the ABM treaty are among the stumbling blocks toward reaching agreement on an accord that would halve the superpowers' arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, noting the approaching 27th anniversary of the construction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, said Friday the barrier is `` dramatic proof of communism's failed dream.'' Noting a speech he gave last year challenging Soviet General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to tear down the wall, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is honored to stand firmly with the British and French to defend the freedom and promote the well-being of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' `` Aug. 13 -LRB- Saturday -RRB- marks a sad anniversary,'' the president said in a statement. `` That wall is a both a scar across the city of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and a symbol of the division of the German nation and of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` As tentative breezes of openness begin to stir the societies in the East, the wall now stands in stark contrast to the human struggle for freedom taking place in its shadow,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` There is no more dramatic proof of communism's failed dream than the wall.'' He said that `` as we recall the construction of the wall on this day in 1961, the people the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reaffirm their commitment to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and salute the brave people who live there.''

<HEAD>USDA Sees Economic Problems if Softwood Depletion Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Much of the South could suffer economically if the depletion of softwood timber continues at the current pace without being replaced, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief F. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said a new study by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency, state forestry agencies and universities, and the forest industry found that the annual removal of timber is greater than growth in many areas of the South. Timber is the region's leading agricultural crop, and the processing of timber and timber products is the primary source of employment, he said. `` Although the results of this study are of concern, we have also found numerous opportunities for ensuring that timber production can continue to prosper and grow in the South,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` Since the 1880s, when the South's first forest was devastated by fire and poor management, two new forests have been regenerated and harvested,'' he said. `` The South's fourth forest, the forest of the future, can be even more productive.'' According to the report, 22 million acres of cropland and pasture in the South would be of more value if the lands were planted in pine trees. Conversion to timber production could increase annual softwood growth by 2.1 billion cubic feet, the report said. And the replanting of cutover and non-productive trees on cutover lands could increase net annual growth by an additional 3.2 billion cubic feet. In other words, the study showed that conversion of cropland and replanting could nearly double the South's current annual softwood growth of 5.7 billion cubic feet. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the report presents a challenge and an opportunity for southern farmers and landowners. `` Already, the owners of 1.5 million acres of highly erodible cropland in the South have decided to plant trees on that acreage under <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Conservation Reserve Program, he said. `` More opportunities exist to increase timber growth profitably.'' Copies of a summary of the report, `` The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>'s Fourth Forest: Opportunities to Increase the Resource Wealth of the South,'' are available from: <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experiment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, 701 <LOCATION> Loyola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ave. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. 70113.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s newest princess entered royal life in high style Friday with a flight to the queen's summer home in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> after leaving the hospital with her parents, the <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Bundled in a white blanket, the still unnamed 4-day-old Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> left <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the arms of her mother, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, as hundreds of spectators strained for a glimpse of her tiny face. A smiling <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> wore a small bear-shaped badge which said, `` I'm a Mum. Minutes later, the princess was whisked off to <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, where her grandmother <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was expected to approve a name for her. The baby is the first child for <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and his wife, and the queen's fifth grandchild. She is fifth in line to the throne. The royal threesome drove straight from the hospital in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base for a flight to the northern Scottish coast and a car ride to the castle, said a Buckingham Palace spokesman. The queen and her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, were to arrive at the castle Monday after sailing up the Scottish coast on the royal yacht <LOCATION> Brittania </LOCATION>, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. The monarch and her family traditionally spend parts of August and September at the estate. At the hospital, hospital chefs and nurses joined several hundred spectators awaiting the new princess' first appearance. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Nicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Freer </PERSON> said, `` in general it has been a pleasure having -LRB- the duchess -RRB- here. ... We all wanted to say goodbye.'' As the princess left the hospital, her face was barely visible, but one newscaster narrating the event broadcast live on TV said those `` with zoom lenses caught a glimpse of an eyebrow, an alert eye, and a hint that she could have hair like her mother's.'' There was a slight mishap when the red-headed <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> handed the baby to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and stumbled while hurrying across the street to receive a bouquet of pink carnations from an American tourist. She recovered as bodyguards rushed to give her a hand. `` I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Alasio </PERSON> of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I'm very glad she did n't fall over all the way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> told reporters he hoped he would suffer `` only a few'' sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to his naval duties in the Far East next week. Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: `` I am overjoyed.'' British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices for the baby's name include <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was quoted as saying in May that he favored <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today reviewed a House-approved bill that would require counties to adopt central purchasing systems, a reform proposal prompted by a widespread <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into local corruption. The Legislature is meeting in a special session called by Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> in an attempt to change the prevailing county system under which each of five county supervisors directly oversees operations in his or her district. As state auditor for the four years before he was elected governor, <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> assisted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in its `` Operation Pretense'' investigation into corrupt county purchasing. It resulted in the arrests of 52 supervisors in 24 counties, of which 43 were convicted or pleaded guilty and 23 received prison sentences. The measure, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Thursday on a 111-10 vote, is similar to a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the 1988 regular session. Under the House-passed bill, a unit system for road construction and maintenance would have to be in place by Oct. 1, 1989. Twenty-two counties already have a similar system. The central purchasing system would remain in effect unless county voters rejected the plan. The measure passed without debate and few amendments were approved. One significant amendment adopted would prohibit a member of the board of supervisors from acting also as county administrator, central purchasing clerk or road manager. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met this morning to discuss the bill after a brief session Thursday. Although the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were stalemated at the end of the 1988 session on the bill, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said he believed things would be different this time. `` These -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members -RRB- realize just like those <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members that we ca n't leave here wihout passing that legislation,'' he said. Under the new system, one appointed administrator would oversee day-to-day purchasing for the county, a job currently shared by supervisors.

<TEXT>
 Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technical experts involved in monitoring <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear blasts have been relieved of their duties after the Soviets found them trying to make off with `` souvenirs'' from an atomic test site, administration spokesmen said Friday. The spokesmen, dismissing the episode as a `` misunderstanding,'' said the items found by Soviet authorities in creates being prepared for shipment back home included a small hammer, a piece of barbed wire, and several rock and core samples from a hole being drilled at the site. The July 17 incident occurred near <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION>, in south-central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. A U.S.-Soviet agreement allows each country to observe and monitor each other's nuclear blasts. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts were at the site in advance of a planned explosion in September. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that after consultations with Soviet authorities, it was decided that the three, who were not identified, will not be returning to the testing site next month. One was said to be an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee and the other two reportedly were working under <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The Soviets expressed concern over the incident but no formal protest was lodged, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the hammer and the barbed wire were intended as personal souvenirs. As for the geological samples, the Americans asked the Soviets for permission to remove the items and had reason to believe the request would be approved, he said. `` These items were of a minor nature, certainly not of any military or technical significance,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, describing the incident as a `` misunderstanding.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't believe it was intelligence activity of any kind, but it was a personal mistake on their part.'' Asked whether it was n't strange for Americans to try to make off with rocks and soil, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` If you're involved in this kind of work, those might be considered souvenirs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions that the soil and rock samples are regarded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as potentially useful in assessing yields of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear blasts. One official told the Post that soil samples can be examined for radioactive contaminaton, which might reveal the type and quantity of nuclear materials used in nuclear bombs. But <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the rock and core samples were of the same type as that already provided to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts by the Soviets. According to <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the issue has been discussed at length between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet authorities and is being resolved. He added that the joint monitoring program will continue with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test set for Aug. 17 in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and the Soviet test scheduled for mid-September.

 A federal judge removed from a <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> case by an appeals court said today he wants to hear from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before deciding whether to bar himself from all federal government cases. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, at the end of an hour-long hearing on his own motion to ban himself from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> litigation, withheld any immediate ruling. He said he did not know how he would rule eventually but `` I have made my mind up that I am not going to rule on my motion to recuse until I hear from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>,'' who is director of the civil rights division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' comments about his being assigned to hear <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s college desegregation case, which has been marred by judicial conflict, including bitter language over the removal of a black federal judge, during the past several years. `` I will defer until I hear from him on that matter,'' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said. Attending today's hearing was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge U.W. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>, who in 1980 became the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. He was removed from the college desegregation case by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on grounds that <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>'s past role as a state senator and civil rights attorney presented a judicial conflict. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>, in a 10-page opinion this week, fired back that he was the victim of a double standard demeaning to black federal jurists. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, a 60-year-old white judge who was appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1982, was not urged to disqualify himself from all federal government cases during today's hearing. Three attorneys _ <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> _ told the judge they had found him to be fair and impartial.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to send another of its billion-dollar `` Aegis'' cruisers to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to replace the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, which shot down an Iranian airliner July 3, officers said Friday. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said the departure of the USS Mobile Bay `` has been temporarily postponed until further notice.'' The Mobile Bay had been scheduled to leave the base Friday to join the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which includes 27 warships in the gulf and <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he could not discuss the reasons and Maj. <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, declined comment on whether the delay was related to Iran-Iraq cease-fire scheduled for Aug. 20. Military sources in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> indicated privately the decision was related to an expected cutback in the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force after a truce in the 8-year-old war, but would not be specific. They said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was expected to remain in the region until early September, and one said an end to the war would `` sharply reduce any need'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to send another of its most sophisticated warships to the region. Ships normally serve about three months with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> force and the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which arrived May 22, had been expected to leave for its home port at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in the next two weeks. The military sources described the practice as `` flexible,'' but would not say why the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was being kept on longer than usual. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> policy provides for ships to be away from home ports no longer than six months. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> repeated this week that the force of 27 warships, including 18 in the gulf, would be reduced sharply if the cease-fire held for a `` prudent'' period. All 290 people aboard the Airbus A300 were killed when the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook it for an Iranian F-14 fighter on an attack course and shot it down with missiles. An official report is expected to be released later this month after study by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials have said it will blame `` human error'' by radar operators in the stress of first-time combat. The ship had sunk two Iranian gunboats in a skirmish less than an hour before the jet passed overhead on a flight to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> from a military-civilian airfield in <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>.

 The parents of <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, star of `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' say they strongly support him and _ as evangelical Christians _ want to see the movie. `` We are proud of our son and we trust his judgment,'' said <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>. `` He was brought up in a Christian home, and he believes in God,'' she said. `` And I do not believe he would do anything blasphemous.'' The film shows <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, beset by human temptations and struggling against his fate as the son of God. Thousands of people demonstated against the movie and its producers as it opened in seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities Friday. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic and the film's director, has described it as an affirmation of faith because <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> resists his temptations. Some Christian leaders agree, while others have called for boycotts against the film and demonstrations against <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of filmmaker <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think a lot of people are judgmental before they have seen the picture,'' said the actor's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, a retired surgeon who moved to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> four years ago with his wife, a nurse. `` I think they should decide whether they like it or not when they've seen it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Botha: U.S. Sanctions Bill Could Wreck Namibia Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Friday accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen of `` recklessness'' and said a tough sanctions bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> could jeopardize a regional peace plan. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the legislation would not help South African blacks and might `` obstruct or make impossible'' an initiative to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 73-year rule over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` The recklessness of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who do not care in the least whether their actions adversely affect the search for a peaceful solution to the problems of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a whole is astounding,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The sanctions bill would halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and impose a near-total trade embargo. It was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 244-132 vote Thursday. The bill faces a possible Republican filibuster in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a likely veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Earlier legislation, which passed despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, bars imports of various South African commodities and forbids South African planes to land at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the bill emerged `` for purely internal political aims.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also denounced the bill, saying it would `` destroy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s flexibility'' to seek change through diplomatic pressure Republican members urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a policy of `` black empowerment'' to increase the economic and political power of blacks and weaken apartheid's foundations. But Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, D-Mich., a sanctions supporter, said: `` Black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is an impossibility. Leading black anti-apartheid activists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, have urged the West to intensify sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to grant full political rights to the 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national affairs under apartheid. Many black moderates and conservatives, as well as several prominent white liberals, support the government's contention that sanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will harden the white minority's resistance to political change. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he found it `` particularly remarkable'' that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> acted on the bill `` exactly at a time when positive progress was being made with the peace negotiations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' The three countries Monday announced a cease-fire in the Angolan civil war. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it was prepared to begin implementing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for Namibian independence Nov. 1, provided agreement could be reached on a timetable for withdrawing <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers have been supporting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in a 13-year war against a South African - and U.S.-backed rebel movement The movement, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, is not a party to the cease-fire. `` It would be ironical if Resolution 435 -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> -RRB- should reach the point of implementation only to be obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in the American legislation,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. He said unspecified financial transactions necessary to implement the plan could be affected by the sanctions bill.

 Business inventories climbed for the 18th consecutive month in June, the government said Friday, prompting some economists to warn that companies may be stockpiling goods in anticipation of higher prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories jumped 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 733.9 billion in June, following an identical 0.7 percent rise in May. Inventory levels have not fallen since December 1986. `` My guess is that there is a little buying ahead on inventories in anticipation of higher inflation going on. When it happens, that just adds to inflationary pressures,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in July, a 5.7 percent annual rate that was more than double the 2.2 percent rate for all of 1987. However, other economists, noting that business sales have increased more strongly than inventories, were n't troubled by the gain in goods held on shelves and backlots. Business sales surged 1.5 percent in June to $ 490.6 billion following a 0.8 percent gain in May. It was the fifth month without a decline. `` Even though inventories were up sharply, they were still in line with sales,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's a reflection of the export-driven turnaround in manufacturing. If you're selling more domestically and overseas, then you need more inventory,'' she said. `` There's been some hedge buying against price increases, but we think it's been fairly small,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. Inventories in June were 7.8 percent higher than a year ago, while sales were 8.1 percent higher. The June inventory accumulation was boosted by a 1.0 percent climb at the retail level, where sales were weakest, a 0.8 percent increase at the wholesale level and a 0.4 percent gain at factories. The strength in business sales was paced by a 2.5 percent jump at wholesalers. Sales from manufacturing plants climbed 1.5 percent and retail sales were up only 0.4 percent. An advance estimate of retail sales for July, released Thursday, showed a 0.5 percent increase. The combination of strongly rising sales and moderately rising inventories pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio down slightly from 1.51 in May to 1.50 in June. That means it would take 1.50 months to exhaust inventories at the June sales pace, a ratio not considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Iranian President: War Made Iran a Regional Power</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has emerged from eight years of war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as a victorious regional power with new worldwide respect. Also on Friday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims that it shelled <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military positions. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fact-finding team arrived in the Iranian capital to investigate allegations of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons. `` Today, the system of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, for all the ineffective efforts of the enemies, has turned into an important power in the whole of the region,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said at a prayer sermon at the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. His remarks were broadcast on state-run <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. `` The nation of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is counted as an armed and established military force in the region,'' he said. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> gained worldwide respect because of the military prowess it displayed in the war, which he said the country acquired without depending on outside powers. `` These eight years of war and resistance taught other nations that it is possible to defend themselves without depending on big powers,'' he said, adding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had been defeated because `` it has not been able to achieve its despicable objectives.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed last week to an Aug. 20 cease-fire in their conflict, which killed or wounded an estimated 1 million people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had recently suffered a series of losses on the battlefield, leading it to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution July 18. In another development, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Friday for talks about British and other foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian groups. Before leaving <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said he would speak with officials about the 18 hostages, who include Anglican envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and two other Britons as well as nine Americans. The foreign hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> dismissed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s claims of Iranian shelling as `` false propaganda,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Thursday of shelling Iraqi military positions near the <LOCATION> Shatt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, where the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war broke out in September 1980. The accusation was made in a statement issued by the Iraqi mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It was not carried on newscasts in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> urged Iranian volunteer and other forces to remain at the front to defend the country and to give more power to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the international political scene. `` Even after the war, defense will continue and members of the armed forces and volunteers must be present to defend <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s territorial integrity alongside the country's reconstruction,'' he told the throng of worshipers Worshipers chanted `` Down with the U.S.A.!'' `` Down with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>!'' and `` Down with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>!'' and pledged to obey revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The audience at <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s sermon included about 100 Iraqi prisoners of war, with about 25 of them wearing red headbands indicating they want to fight Iraqi President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. The crowd was smaller than that at a similar sermon attended by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter four weeks ago. An official at the prayer service said the crowd was small `` because so many people have followed the call to go to the battle front.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. Plastic collection boxes were on hand at the sermon for worshipers to contribute to the war effort. Since <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> announced it was accepting the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, the once all-pervasive slogan `` War, war until victory!'' has been abandoned, said a Westerner based in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a four-member team of chemical weapons experts would travel to the northwestern Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Oshnaviyeh </LOCATION> in the province of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> alleges that a chemical attack on the town earlier this month injured more than 2,000 civilians, including many women and children. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reports have confirmed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons in the past. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said Friday that the 350 unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers monitoring the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will have headquarters in both <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Several members of the observer group are already in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, and the rest are to be in place Wednesday in preparation for the Aug. 20 cease-fire.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials have agreed to meet later this month to continue efforts at ascertaining the fate of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen missing in action from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The meeting between technical experts of both countries will take place Aug. 22-23 in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We welcome this latest indication of Lao willingness to increase cooperation in this important concern and other matters of mutual interest,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' agreement to hold the meeting is another sign of the increasing openness of the communist government over the past year, including economic reforms and plans to decentralize the bureaucracy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to account for 555 Americans listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, many of them airmen downed during missions against Laotian and Vietnamese communist positions. Under an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reached in August 1987, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> ended a long period of inactivity on the MIA issue, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promised to consider <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' request for emergency food and other aid. Last May, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Laotian officials conducted a joint excavation for the remnants of an American plane shot down in 1966 with two crewmen on board. No remains were found. Following the dig, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave $ 13,000 worth of medicine to a Laotian hospital. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' request for additional aid is expected to be raised again in the talks this month.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at his side, told administration officials today they must persuade voters that in the election `` what's at stake is a way of life.'' Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blamed rising interest rates on `` eight years of borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the 30,000-word <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform was taking shape, combining statements of party positions on domestic and foreign policy issues with sweeping attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, addressed about 200 administration officials whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said must be `` messengers of hope'' in the campaign. `` All the good things you've accomplished are not in focus in the minds of the electorate,'' the vice president said. The officials' job, he said, would be to spread the word of administration successes and pave the way for extending `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution into the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> era.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a jovial mood, welcomed the officials `` to the White House complex.'' `` White House complex _ that's what the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have after eight years out of office. The incredible thing is, they still ca n't take the hint,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, one of the people on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of potential running mates, said he had called the vice president and asked that he be removed from consideration. `` I talked to the family about it and I now believe that at this moment in the time of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and his family, it's not the right thing to do,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told reporters. As the 106-member platform committee began its final session in the party's convention city, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> said, `` There is one person who can fill the full measure of the awesome charge of being president _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The grim truth is, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, that the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training.'' Winding up a five-state campaign swing, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget deficits were to blame for rising interest rates. `` As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to the door,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a breakfast at the governor's mansion in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` That's what happened yesterday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He referred to the fact that major banks raised their prime lending rate half a percentage point Thursday to 10 percent. That is the rate charged their largest, most credit-worthy customers. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also announced it was going on the air in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with its first television advertisement of the general election campaign. The one-minute commercial will stress <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' economic themes, his accomplishments as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and include excerpts from his Democratic convention speech. With less than a week to go before he will claim the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination in the mammoth Superdome, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joining President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a pre-campaign pep talk to senior administration officials who are expected to fan out across the country this fall to boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said the heart of the platform `` will not change that much'' from its conservative stance of 1980 and 1984. `` We're a conservative political party,'' he said. `` We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the ` c' word.'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said the document will reflect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans for `` a new direction in education, in environment, in child care.'' `` The vice president came here in an unprecedented event and spoke to this platform committee and tried to give them that direction, so that this really will truly be a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> platform,'' he said. Before the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee adjourned Thursday, it finished its draft of domestic planks. The major remaining fight was over a Star Wars plank that called for deployment of the space-based missile defense system `` as soon as technically feasible,'' language backed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Conservatives sought a call for `` rapid and certain'' deployment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> he jogs and plays horseshoes to help relieve the pressure of preparing for his acceptance speech at next Thursday night's convention session. `` I'm no <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and I think it'll go OK,'' he said in a reference to the Democratic politician and orator from the turn of the century. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign leaked private polling data that said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leder <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more than other potential running mates, but by a margin not considered very significant. A campaign source said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator and former rival for the nomination added `` a little bit, but not enough to make much of a difference.'' The data from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> were described as all but complete. Three national polls released Thursday showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' post-convention surge had crested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 18-point lead the week after the Democratic convention shrank to 14 points in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey conduced Aug. 5-8. A CNN-USA Today poll the same Aug. 5-8 period gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 12-point lead, while a Business Week poll done Aug. 4-9 put the two candidates in a dead heat. All three of the polls placed support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the 50 percent range, while support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ranged from 36 percent to 45 percent. The margins of error were three percentage points either way in each poll.

 Hungarians angry about the noise caused by low-flying Soviet military jets have succeeded in persuading the Soviets to reduce the number of training flights and to fly at a higher altitude, it was reported this week. A rare `` village meeting'' took place between residents of the small towns of <LOCATION> Szigethalom </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Szazhalombatta </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and commanders at the nearby Soviet base of <LOCATION> Toekoel </LOCATION> early this week. State television said the Hungarians pointed out cracks in walls they said were caused by the piercing noise of low-flying jets. The Soviets agreed to stop any training flights on state and religious holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, and between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on weekdays, television and radio reported. The number of training flights overall will be reduced and the jets will fly at a higher altitude, the media said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, claiming Americans `` do n't want to gamble their future on a blind date,'' told top administration officials today that `` we are going to hold the White House with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Speaking to about 250 senior officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying, `` he's been a great vice president but I think he will an even greater president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who spoke before the president at the pep rally in the Old Executive Office Building, told the officials, `` I need you to help mobilize our troops ... I need you to march to victory again in November.'' The meeting today was one in a series of joint appearances planned for the president and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will be installed formally as the Republican presidential nominee next week at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Many of the administration officials will speak on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf during the fall election campaign. `` Who's tending the store?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> jokingly asked the large gathering of senior administration officials. `` Welcome to the White House complex,'' he said. `` That's what our opponents have after being eight years out of power,'' he joked. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the gathering he would be `` crisscrossing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this fall'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy and to spell out the accomplishments of the Reagan-Bush years. `` You all are part of a great and continuing success story,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. At the same time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We've got five full months ahead of us. We're going to continue to advance our programs and policies until we cross the finish line next January.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies work,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The other folks talk, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deliver ... We are going to hold the White House with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` Most people will vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this year because, after voting for him twice before, they know he's their guarantee that peace and propsperity today will be followed by more peace and prosperity tomorrow.'' `` And frankly,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continued, `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to gamble their future on a blind date.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a gavel at the conclusion of his speech, claiming, `` I figure that with the convention coming up, you can probably use that gavel. If not there, from experience there will be a lot of meetings with the congressional leadership when you can use that.'' The meeting was attended by Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials, who are exempt from a federal prohibition on campaigning that applies to lower-level federal bureucrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the officials `` the field commanders of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution'' and said, `` more than most Americans, you have an important understanding of the importance of the election that stands ahead.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are to meet again at an airport rally next Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves the convention city and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives. The two also are expected to spend about four or five days after the convention campaigning together, according to campaign sources. Meanwhile, top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign advisers were to hold a strategy session today to discuss convention logistics and the vice president's closely guarded selection of a running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he would not discuss `` who's off the list and who's on the list,'' although campaign sources did say that private polls for the campaign show former rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., would give him a larger boost than others being considered However, the sources also said that a Bush-Dole ticket showed up as only marginally stronger than other potential combinations for which polling was done. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s advantage `` is a little bit, but not enough to make much of a difference,'' said one source. A ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ran stronger than a hypothetical ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the sources said. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with a group of black Republican supporters and vowed to make an aggressive effort to court black voters who have traditionally voted Democratic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his campaign would demonstrate his `` commitment in the field of civil rights and in opening the arms of this party.'' He declined to say whether he would name a black to his Cabinet, a promise he had made previously only to Hispanics. He also refused to be dawn into a discussion of whether he was considering Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the first black ever to hold the post of national security adviser, for the No. 2 spot. `` I have worked closely with <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and I have great respect for him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` Do n't put it into any vice presidential equation.'' Several newspaper columns have suggested <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as an ideal running mate, an idea also backed by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is believed to be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` short list.'' Sources close to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection process said that <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is not being actively considered. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he's opposed to higher interest rates but wo n't criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s action this week raising the discount rate, the rate it charges for short-term loans to banks, from 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent. `` I ca n't assault them right now for this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' `` Business World,'' scheduled to be aired Sunday. `` You've got to find the right mix'' to prevent inflation or high interest rates from gaining the upper hand, he said. In raising the rate that usually provides a bellwether for other rates throughout the economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it was acting to keep the lid on inflation. A transcript of the taped interview was released Thursday by the network. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and voiced support for the recommendation of a commission headed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> that a single agency _ preferably the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> _ be given authority over financial markets. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, was selected by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last week to succeed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as treasury secretary. However, the White House never has endorsed the findings of his report on the Oct. 19 stock market crash.

 About 400 uniformed workers from the state-run railway marched through the streets Friday to demand higher wages and overtime pay. The workers from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Railway Administration handed a petition to <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials. A spokesman for the workers, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-chang </PERSON>, said the railway company should raise their salaries and immediately make overtime payments owed to the workers. The workers did not say how much more they want. After a one-day strike by conductors in May that halted rail service throughout the island, the railway had promised to make the overtime payments over a four-year period. Railway workers earn an average of about $ 700 a month. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> legalized strikes in June but banned strikes without the authorization of labor associations.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Friday laid a wreath at a monument to fallen shipyard workers in a ceremony marking the eighth anniversary of strikes that launched the now-outlawed independent trade union. A Solidarity spokeswoman said about 2,000 shipyard workers and other Solidarity supporters attended the ceremony near the entrance to the Lenin shipyard. The crowd chanted Solidarity slogans, waved banners and sang the national anthem, said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowiz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, wearing a Solidarity T-shirt, helped put wreaths and flowers on the monument, erected to honor striking shipyard workers killed by security forces during labor unrest in 1970. The ceremony was held two days before the official 1980 strike anniversary, which falls on a Sunday this year, to allow more workers to attend, said the Solidarity spokeswoman. On Aug. 14, 1980, workers in the Lenin shipyards in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> began a strike over reinstating a fired crane operator. Two days later the demands grew to include an independent trade union, and Solidarity was born. The union at its peak claimed about 10 million members, or nearly one-third of the nation's population. The union was crushed when martial law was imposed in 1981. It was banned by parliament the next year. Police watched the ceremony but did not intervene, witnesses said.

 About 2,000 students and some Roman Catholic nuns chanting slogans denouncing the `` U.S.-Aquino regime'' marched to an <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base Friday to demand <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military facilities be closed. About 120 Filipino riot police guarded the main gate to <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> as the protesters arrived from a church-run school two miles away. The demonstrators included delegations from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, 50 miles to the south. The group was to hold a similar protest Saturday outside <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military TV station, the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network-Philippines </LOCATION>, warned viewers of the rally and urged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military personnel to use other routes to avoid the protest. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> are the largest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service personnel, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians and military dependents are stationed at <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> and four smaller installations. Also on Friday, Capt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, commander of the battleship <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could relocate its facilities but hoped such a time would not come. He said <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> was `` the finest base in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and it would be a loss'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> if the lease on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is not renewed when it expires in 1991. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is under pressure not to renew the 1947 bases agreement. She has agreed to honor the lease through 1991 but refuses to say if she would support an extension. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino panels have been negotiating for more than four months on terms that should apply during the agreement's last two years. According to sources close to the talks, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government is demanding compensation for the bases be increased to $ 1.2 billion annually The Americans now provide $ 180 million a year in military and economic aid for continued use of the bases. The sources said the Americans are not willing to pay such a drastic increase in compensation without assurances that the bases will be allowed to remain beyond 1991. Speeches and slogans during Friday's rally accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of subservience to the Americans and said she already has secretly agreed to extend the agreement. `` The truth is the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government is ready to give the Americans what they want in exchange for a big amount of money,'' said <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Manapat </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear-Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zenaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Uy </PERSON>, secretary general of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of selling out <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> sovereignty.

 With Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promising he wo n't name his running mate until next week's Republican convention, the field of potential candidates shrunk today when <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he had withdrawn from consideration. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this morning and said he did n't want to be considered further because of the potential impact the job would have on his family He had been one of more than a dozen people contacted as a possible running mate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Earlier, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> also had taken himself out the running. `` The vice president's job requies a lot of national and international travel,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` My wife could n't travel with me because I've got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not true of the other candidates. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff debated the best way to orchestrate the announcement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. Originally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had planned to keep the name a secret until next Thursday, the final day of the convention. However, his aides now fear that would steal too much thunder from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance speech, which is on the same day, so they are considering moving the announcement up to Wednesday. `` Obviously, a consideration is a desire to maximize the suspense factor,'' said a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. On the other hand, there is a rule that you `` do n't step on other relatively good stories'' such as the Thursday night speech. Another campaign official, also speaking anonymously, said there was `` a lot of pressure to look at Wednesday'' for an announcement. In any event, one of the aides said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` enjoying this whole thing'' as suspense mounts over his choice. `` There wo n't be any leaks of this one because I'm not gon na tell a soul and I have n't so far,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a CBS-TV interview. He said some stories on the subject are `` close to accurate and some of them are 180 degrees wrong.'' Private polls conducted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign indicate that Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> would give him more of a boost than any others in contention for the No. 2 spot, but `` not enough to make much of a difference,'' said one aide. A ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ran stronger than a hypothetical ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, sources said. `` I do n't think there is anybody under consideration who guarantees -LRB- a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory in -RRB- any state or region,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a Republican consultant with ties to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. As for the timing of the announcement, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think it makes a whole lot of difference.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at an appearance with black supporters Thursday, declined to say whether he was considering Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the first black ever to hold the post of national security adviser. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> has been suggested by several newspaper columns and has been backed by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> People who were contacted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and asked to provide financial data, include both Doles, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, and Sens. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, according to campaign aides. Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, rumored to be under consideration, said on national television she was n't interested in the job. Govs. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and former governor <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> were also among those on the original list of those under consideration, the aides said. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has since withdrawn his name from consideration. Sources suggested that no polling had been done on <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, suggesting that he may no longer be under active consideration. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he has no expectations that he'll get picked, and is `` not sitting by the telephone'' waiting to be asked. But he said he would, naturally, jump at the job. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he, too, would accept an offer. Moreover, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his inclusion on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list is not a political favor to focus attention on <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s junior senator. ` I do n't think that's the case,'' he said. `` The answer is no. N-O. Capital N-O,'' he said.

 A joint team of military personnel from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will try to scale a mountain peak in the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION> next month, expedition leaders said Friday. Maj. H.S. <PERSON> Chauhan </PERSON>, the leader of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> delegation, told a news conference the expedition would assault the 23,860-foot Mana peak in the second or third week of September, depending on the weather. The two countries will send 13 men each on the expedition. The Indian side comprises army men, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation consists of 11 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers and two from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The peak, about 210 miles northeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, has been climbed only three times. The expedition will try the climb from the southern side of the mountain, <PERSON> Chauhan </PERSON> said. He said the climbers will have to negotiate a 1.2-mile-long glacier before scaling the northwestern ridge. `` And that's a razor-sharp ridge,'' he added. The last 4,950 feet to the summit will have to be attempted on a fixed rope, <PERSON> Chauhan </PERSON> said. Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, said his squad was looking forward to the adventure. `` The Himalayas are acknowledged as the ultimate goal of all mountaineers,'' he said. `` We hope to see significantly higher altitudes than in other continents.'' The team is the first to be sent to the Himalayas from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. The Indian army, which regularly sends expeditions to the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION>, has collaborated on climbs with British and French army teams in the past two years.

 <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Friday after 17 days as leader of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and the focus of a bloody popular uprising against 26 years of repression, economic ruin and isolation imposed by a socialist military regime. His government acknowledged 95 people were killed during a week of violence in which soldiers regularly opened fire on unarmed protesters, many of them high school students or Buddhist monks. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say hundreds were killed and some estimates surpass 1,000. Reports from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> indicated security forces in at least two towns had sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader waging his own war against the government called for a coordinated nationwide offensive to support them. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned as president of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and head of its only political party, but it did not announce a successor or say why he stepped down. The radio said <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would met next Friday <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, a leading American expert on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, said by telephone that a likely candidate to succeed <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON>, a relatively liberal military officer. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON>, who received some military training in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has been No. 3 in the government and party. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, 64, was elected president and party chief July 26 after the resignation of Ne Win, who had held power since a coup in 1962 and applied economic policies that made this potentially affluent nation one of the world's poorest. Students, monks, workers and other filled the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> almost immediately, demanding <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s ouster. They blamed the former general for brutally crushing student demonstrations in March and June, and cited his bloody suppression of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> riots after the coup. Demonstrators recited chants and waved placards calling him `` dog, a butcher, a Nazi.'' The protests spread to two dozen other cities, and the killing began Tuesday. Western diplomats who estimated the death toll in the hundreds said no firm information was available because of the chaos and because of a `` battle for the bodies'' between soldiers and protesters. `` When someone is killed -LRB- the protesters -RRB- try to get it, so they can display the bodies, and the government tries to get it to cremate it'' and destroy evidence of of deaths, one said. Friday's broadcast by the official radio said the capital `` has been peaceful since last night and law and order was maintained... There were almost no demonstrations or violence. The people of the whole city of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> are making preparations to protect against looting.'' It said about 1,000 gathered near a pagoda Friday in the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb of North Okkalapa but dispersed. Thousands of people were said to have fought and trapped soldiers in the suburb in the previous two days. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news agency said soldiers had retained positions around three barricaded `` liberated zones'' in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okalappa </LOCATION> and two other suburbs but were seen leaving after <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation was announced <LOCATION> Brang </LOCATION> Seng, head of the Kachins and a leader of a 10-group guerrilla coalition, called for an offensive `` from north to south,'' to draw soldiers from two dozen towns and cities where they blocked protests. A spokesman for <PERSON> Brang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> quoted a statement as saying rebels would attack government troops but also urging soldiers to join the fight `` for peace and democracy.'' The spokesman, who would not give his name, read the statement by telephone in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Many ethnic rebel groups have fought since independence and control vast areas of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, a nation of 38 million people about the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traded compliments with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a campaign pep talk Friday to top administration officials, and predicted Americans wo n't `` gamble their future on a blind date'' in the November election. `` We're going to hold the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared to about 250 Cabinet and other top administration officials in a spirited pre-convention sendoff for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next door to the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, noting that many of the officials would be on the campaign trail on his behalf as surrogate speakers this fall, said they must persuade voters that `` not just one election but ... a way of life'' is at stake. `` I need you to march to victory again in November,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the group of officials he called the `` field commanders of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution.'' He told them a victory by his Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, would `` totally reverse'' the `` successes of this administration.'' It was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s last scheduled campaign event before he goes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next Tuesday. He will appear again with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at an airport rally there before he is formally installed as his party's presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention In the meantime, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will continue working on his acceptance speech and make his final decision on a running mate _ although he has repeatedly said he'll try to keep his choice secret until the convention is well under way. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who spoke after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, told his audience: `` Some people may cast their vote this year to thank us for the last eight years. But I suspect most people will vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this year bcause, after voting for him once or twice before, they know he's their guarantee that peace and prosperity today will be followed by peace and prosperity tomorrow. `` And frankly,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continued, `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to gamble their future on a blind date.'' It was the first time the two had spoken together in a public political setting since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last May 11 at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner _ an appearance in which the president barely mentioned his vice president's name. However, if that endorsement struck many as lukewarm, the president made up for it in Friday's rally in which he frequently mentioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his partner in `` a great and continuing success story.'' He referred to himself and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` the malaise busters'' who brought `` eight years of steady change, change for the better'' after the administration of Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` There's no way that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will turn back now,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies work. The other folks talk, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deliver,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told cheering officials. `` Who's tending the store?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> jokingly asked the gathering of senior administration officials. `` Welcome to the White House complex,'' he said. `` White House complex _ that's what our opponents have after eight years of being out of power.'' The president said he would be `` crisscrossing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this fall'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy. He also said his own agenda was `` still full,'' and he called for congressional action on a U.S.-Canada free trade bill, administration-backed welfare legislation, new aid for Contra forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and a defense bill that supports his Star Wars Strategic Defense Initiative. `` We've got five full months ahead of us. We're going to continue to advance our programs and policies until we cross the finish line next January,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a gavel at the conclusion of his speech, saying, `` I figure that with the convention coming up ... you can probably use that gavel. If not there, from experience I can tell you there will be a lot of meetings with the congressional leadership when you can use that.'' The meeting was attended by Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials who are exempt from a federal prohibition on campaigning that applies to lower-level federal bureaucrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` proud to be a part of this administration, proud to serve this president.'' `` We all know what will kill, definitively kill, this economic expansion we've worked so hard to create,'' he said. `` Those same Democrats, the <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> or <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> or Mondale Democrats, are just itching to get their hands back on the levers that you operate so ably.''

<HEAD>Hunters Roust Grouse On Glorious Twelfth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hunters flocked to the heather-covered moors of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Friday, `` The Glorious Twelfth of August'' and the start of the grouse-hunting season popular with landed gentry and wealthy tourists. But the hunters' gunfire was muted by declining stocks of the wild red grouse, due to a parasite and vigorous protesters who drove the birds away with a pre-dawn swoop on three grouse moors. The <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saboteurs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes blood sports, said about 300 members beat the hunters to the bushes and rousted the grouse at <LOCATION> Stanhope </LOCATION> and Gunnerside Moors in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and in an area near <LOCATION> Muirshell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the protesters, said they would remain on the moors all day. He described their early success as the `` most glorious day'' in efforts to ban grouse-killing. `` It has become a ` Glorious Twelfth,''' he said. `` We've saved birds lives and that's glorious.'' <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> and lords traditionally lead hunting parties on `` The Glorious Twelfth of August'' _ not to be confused with `` The Glorious Twelfth of July,'' when Protestants in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> celebrate their victory over Roman Catholics in the Battle of the <LOCATION> Boyne </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> restaurants, which used to hire helicopters, race-car drivers and airplanes in an informal competition to whisk the first grouse from the north to their tables, have toned down the publicity stunts, partly because of the protests. `` I think over the last few years there has been very bad press,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s fashionable <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, which ordered 10 grouse to serve Friday night. `` As a result, a lot of hotels have not done as much promotion.'' Gourmets have always turned up their noses at the competition, insisting grouse should hang for four r five days to bring out their true gamey taste. The Ritz Hotel in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Piccadilly area said grouse would be on its menu Friday night for about $ 60 a plate, but `` it will be at its best next week.'' `` Most of our clients prefer it after its been hung for about a week,'' a spokeswoman said. Passengers on <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON>'s 6:50 a.m. flight from <LOCATION> Inverness </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> were among the first to taste this year's grouse. Grouse shot on a Scottish estate before dawn was cooked at the Golsview Hotel in <LOCATION> Nairn </LOCATION>, driven to <LOCATION> Inverness </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> four miles away and served on board. The palatial Gleneagles Hotel in eastern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, traditionally one of the front-runners in the grouse-serving race, abstained for the fourth successive year because of the serious grouse decline, said general manager <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>. `` We feel we should do everything possible to preserve <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s great sporting traditions in the interests of tourism as a whole and for environmental and ecological reasons in particular,'' he said. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s Game Conservancy says the grouse population has fallen steadily since the mid-1970s because of disease and because their native habitats have been taken over as farmland. Grouse hunting is particularly popular among <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s landed gentry, and estate owners charge foreign tourists several hundred dollars a day to shoot on their land. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheard </PERSON>, agent for the Duke of <ORGANIZATION> Devonshire </ORGANIZATION>'s northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> estate at <LOCATION> Bolton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION>, said propects for this year's grouse were `` not too good'' because a parasitic worm called the <LOCATION> Strongyle </LOCATION> has weakened the stock. A Conservative lawmaker said the grouse season is also threatened by a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> proposal which would require that every bird in its member countries be inspected by a veterinarian within 48 hours of death. The proposal is an effort to ensure that wild animals used for food are healthy. The vet would need to remove the feathers and gut the bird, not only delaying its passage to the dinner table but making it impossible to hang game in a traditional way. `` Such an order is fatuous, dictatorial, militaristic, idiotic and totally unacceptable to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or to sportsmen or to anybody who has the brains of a grouse,'' said Sir <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbairn </PERSON>, Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perth </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

 Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> withdrew from consideration Friday as a possible running mate for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying the vice presidency would place too much strain on his family. `` I talked to the family about it and I now believe that at this moment in the time of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and his family, it's not the right thing to do,'' the Republican governor told reporters before a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he received background questionnaires from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign on Monday, but called the vice president Friday morning and said he did n't want to be considered further. `` The vice president's job requires a lot of national and international travel,'' he said. `` My wife could n't travel with me because I've got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not true of the other candidates.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 52, had said previously he did n't expect to be asked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Increased at Near 6 Percent Annual Rate in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wholesale prices rose at a brisk annual rate of 5.7 percent in July despite smaller increases for food, the government said Friday in a report that intensified already deepening concerns about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Producer Price Index, which tracks prices for finished products one step before the retail level, rose 0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in June. But what alarmed analysts most about the July report was that, unlike previous months, the biggest increases were not in the normally highly volatile food and energy sectors but across a wide spectrum of consumer and capital goods. Drugs, men's clothing, tires, soaps, cosmetics, home electronic equipment, glassware, tobacco products and construction equipment all rose at annualized inflation rates in the double digits. In the past two months alone, auto prices have climbed more than 1.5 percent, close to double digits if annualized. `` These prices will slow down, but something else ... will pick up the slack,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, director of economic forecasting at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a lot of inflation kicking around.'' <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said the August figures when they come out next month will look even worse. He predicted a monthly increase of 0.6 percent or annual rate exceeding 7 percent as energy prices rebound and the impact of the Farm Belt drought wends its way through the food production process. Consumer food prices on the wholesale level rose just 0.4 percent in July. The price decline was led by falling meat costs as drought-plagued farmers and ranchers rushed their herds to slaughter rather than continue feeding them high-cost grains. The 0.4 percent gain compared with increases of 1.1 percent in June and 0.9 percent in May. I July, beef prices dropped 2.5 percent; pork plummeted 10.5 percent; and fish prices edged down 0.7 percent. Prices for other food products affected by the drought, such as fruits and poultry products, continued to rise but at a slower pace than in June. Prices for fresh vegetables jumped 7.5 percent after declining 5.7 percent in June, and canned fruits and vegetables rose 1.3 percent, triple the rate of increase the previous month. `` The drought is still not a major factor at the finished goods level, but it will be,'' <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said. `` That's what's worrisome. Peas are in trouble, corn's in trouble, and that is why you seen these canned goods beginning to take off.'' However, he said the effect of the dry weather on consumer prices overall for the year will be only about one-half of 1 percent. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said consumer food prices alone will be pushed about 1 percent higher than they would have been had it not been for the drought. Energy prices, after dropping 1.6 percent in June, were stable last month as a 3 percent increase in the wholesale price for gasoline was offset by a 6.1 percent decline in home heating oil prices. In a related report on the inflationary front, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that business inventories rose 0.7 percent in June despite a 1.5 percent increase in sales. `` We're beginning to see some inventory buying as an inflation hedge,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> economic consultant. `` When that happens, it just adds to inflationary pressures. It's the old too many dollars chasing too few goods.'' The June inventories plus the higher wholesale prices in July suggest that the economy is `` racheting up to a new higher plateau of inflation _ 5 percent to 6 percent at an annual rate _ a good deal sooner than 1989, as most had expected,'' he said. Based on Friday's wholesale price data, <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said he was revising his earlier prediction of consumer inflation in July from an annual rate of about 5 percent upward to about 6 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on July consumer prices will be published Aug. 23. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said that despite Friday's report, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` still believe inflation remains low and under control.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said earlier this week that administration officials were `` disappointed'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had boosted the interest rate charged banks from 6 percent to 6.5 percent in an effort to stem inflationary pressures. However, other private analysts who once shared the administration's view that inflation is not a serious problem yet said they were alarmed by the July wholesale price report. `` There's no way of sugarcoating it _ the report was disturbing because the big increases in prices were outside food and energy,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consultant in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It certainly makes what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> did earlier this week look a little bit more prudent,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. `` The report somewhat overstates the underlying rate of inflation, but clearly it is getting worse.''

 British diplomat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said Friday he will talk to <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials about foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists. <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, arriving for what he said was a two-week stay, would not say which officials he planned to see Saturday. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> would hold talks on `` mutual relations'' during a short visit. It did not elaborate. Before leaving <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said he would speak with officials about the 18 hostages, who include Anglican envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, two other Britons and nine Americans. `` I think it is bound to help,'' <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said. `` The main thing I will be able to do is to remind the Iranian government ... that we would hope that any government that could influence people holding hostages would do so.'' Several of the missing foreigners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed to be held by a pro-Iranian group of Shiite Moslem extremists called <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> wields considerable influence over the faction. No group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the three Britons. In addition to <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seeks the release of journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> man with dual British and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nationality whose release is also sought by the Irish government. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found. <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> is a first secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. While stationed in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1980, he helped Britons escape from the besieged <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said he speaks fluent <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> and has an Iranian-born wife. His visit was not mentioned on the evening radio and television news programs. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been making conciliatory statements about relations with Western nations since it announced July 18 it was accepting a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> call for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s only representative in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>, said the hostage issue could be solved if all sides showed good will, and his embassy announced it was sincerely trying to help. A British official source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> has been told repeatedly that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is in a position to get freedom for the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, it should do so on humanitarian grounds. `` In a way this a very blatant admission -LRB- of involvement -RRB-,'' the source said. He stressed the government would make no deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and was not involved with the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> talks. `` There is no change and can be no change in our position that there will no deals.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also said it appreciated the efforts of Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, who met in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Wednesday with a representative of the Iranian Foreign Ministry from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> representatives met again Friday with the official, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamedi </PERSON>. In July, an Anglican bishop went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to initiate inquiries among Christians about the fate of four Iranians who were believed kidnapped by Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has repeatedly sought information on the four. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in January 1987 while trying to secure the release of American hostages. The longest-held hostage is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was seized March 16, 1985. Relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have improved markedly in recent weeks. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> closed its embassy and withdrew the ambassador from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1980 after Revolutionary Guards stormed the building, denouncing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as an ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last summer, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew all its diplomats, who worked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, and virtually broke diplomatic relations. The move came after a British diplomat was detained and beaten in apparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges. On Thursday, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said `` speculation looms large'' that <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> will visit Briton <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, held in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on espionage charges. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 52, a nephew of the late British poet and novelist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, was arrested in December 1985 and held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Evin </LOCATION> prison The newspaper said with the arrival of <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> took a giant stride in expansion of bilateral ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.''

 The former girlfriend of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> star <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> struck out in court Friday when a commissioner threw out her suit seeking $ 6 million compensation for four years of part-time companionship. `` Score one for <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>,'' exulted <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, attorney for the four-time American League batting champion. The suit by <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, sought $ 6 million in punitive damages and compensation for lost wages for time she spent on <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> road trips with <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, 30, who is married and has two children. <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palk </PERSON> rejected the suit as being improperly grounded in law, but left open the possibility that it could be refiled if it is amended.

The suit contended that <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> essentially lived together during <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> road trips, and that by breaking off the affair, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> broke an oral contract that called for her to provide companionship.

A contract for sex is illegal, invalidating any legal claim by any party to such a contract, she argued. The third-baseman has apologized to <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, his wife of 10 years and regrets the affair, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> acknowledges taking Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, identified by her attorney as a mortgage broker, along on most of the team's road trips for two years. But he broke off the affair two years ago, his lawyer said. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is planning a `` kiss-and-tell'' book about the affair and has signed a literary agent to try to sell the memoir to publishers.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A South African delegation met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet and British diplomats Friday about the possibility of subscribing to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. No details were disclosed. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has been signed by 137 governments since its preparation in 1969, countries without such weapons open their nuclear facilities to inspection by experts from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency based in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Of the five acknowledged nuclear powers, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have signed but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have not. Also among the holdouts are countries believed either to possess nuclear weapons or the potential of producing them, including <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A South African statement said the delegation was led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Energy Minister <PERSON> Danie </PERSON> <PERSON> Steyn </PERSON>. It said discussions covered `` the effect and interpretation of the provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> NPT </ORGANIZATION>,'' a common official reference to the treaty, and `` clarity was sought ... on the rights and privileges which would apply should the Republic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accede to the <ORGANIZATION> NPT </ORGANIZATION>.'' The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday delegation would convey <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s willingness to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection. In the past, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had refused to submit all its nuclear facilities to inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is widely believed to have the technical capability to produce nuclear weapons, but whether it possesses them has not been established. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON>, said concerns about its weapons potential were raised in the discussions but gave not details. African and other third-world countries have repeatedly attempted to have <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ousted as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> because of its refusal to sign the treaty and its apartheid policy of racial segregation.

 Sikh separatists planted three time bombs in two northern cities Friday, killing seven people and injuring at least 37, police said. On Thursday, a gang believed to be upper-class Hindus attacked two neighboring villages in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, killing 11 <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> untouchables, news reports said. A bomb placed on the roof of a state-owned bus went off 20 minutes after the vehicle left the bus terminal at <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, killing seven people and injuring 35, said Police Chief Surinder <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Brar </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, the winter capital of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state, a bomb exploded in a scooter rickshaw, injuring two people, said Police Superintendent D.S. <LOCATION> Salathia </LOCATION>. Sikh militants also were blamed for placing a time bomb in the most popular and crowded shopping center of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, but the device was detected and defused before it detonated. `` Another 15 minutes and it would have exploded,'' said superintendent <PERSON> R.P </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. He said the device was detected after someone reported seeing a suspicious canister with a watch attached to it. <PERSON> Brar </PERSON> said a bomb exploded on a bus six miles south of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> bound for the town of <LOCATION> Shazadpur </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> is the joint capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> states. Sikhs form only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but form a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Radicals have been agitating for an independent Sikh homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982, claiming discrimination by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who form 80 percent of the population. The separatist campaign has killed 1,680 people this year. `` It was an encounter with death,'' said <PERSON> Yash </PERSON> <PERSON> Bir </PERSON>, a passenger on the bus who suffered burn injuries in the explosion. `` I was unconscious. I do not know who brought me to hospital.'' <PERSON> Bir </PERSON> spoke to reporters from a bed in a <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> hospital, where most of the injured were taken. Doctors said five were in serious condition. The victims were not immediately identified. <PERSON> Brar </PERSON> said the bomb was planted on the bus' rooftop luggage carrier. About 70 passengers were in the vehicle. In other parts of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikh militants were blamed for five other killings Thursday night and Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. At least three victims were Sikhs, the news agency said. The militants have targeted Hindus and moderate Sikhs in their campaign. The Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> news agency said at least two people were seriously injured in the attack on untouchables in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> on Thursday. No arrests were reported, but the killers are suspected to be upper-class Hindus. More than 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people are Hindus, who are mainly divided into four castes. Below the castes are the Harijans or untouchables, the lowest group. Caste prejudices have lessened since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> gained independence in 1947, but divisions are more apparent in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, the poorest state in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Prejudices often erupt into violence there because many untouchables have joined Marxist groups that agitate for distribution of land owned by upper-caste Hindus.

 Interest rates on new one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages surged to the highest level in nine months this week while fixed-rate mortgages jumped almost to the high point for the year, according to a nationwide survey released Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a government-chartered company owned by savings institutions and known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, said the one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages this week averaged 8.00 percent, up from 7.90 percent the week before. It was the highest since rates averaged 8.11 percent the week ending Nov. 6. Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent from 10.44 percent the previous week. That was just slightly below the high for the year so far _ 10.58 percent _ the average for the weeks ending May 27 and June 3. The jump in rates this week followed a move Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to push up interest rates to slow the economy and fight inflation. Economists predict a wide range of interest rates, including mortgage rates, will increase further this year. Fixed-rate mortgages hit a peak just before the October stock market crash of 11.58 percent. As the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pumped money into the economy to avoid a recession, the average dropped to 9.84 percent in early February. The increase since then means homebuyers taking out $ 100,000 mortgages now face about $ 670 more in annual costs than they would have on a fixed-rate mortgage taken out six months ago. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said fixed-rate mortgages likely will rise another three-quarters of a percentage point by the end of the year. `` I think it's going to slow down the housing sector, but I do n't think this is the death of the industry,'' he said. Fixed-rate mortgages have fluctuated widely over the past several years, depending on financial market assessment of inflation dangers. But the one-year rate has stayed relatively low, serving as an alternative for home buyers when fixed rates jump. However, adjustable rates now are also moving higher, reflecting <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightening, which has a more immediate effect on short-term rates than on long-term rates. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates federally insured savings institutions, said fixed-rate mortgages declined slightly from 10.78 percent in early June to 10.73 percent in early July. The dip followed three consecutive monthly increases. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> averages, the bank board numbers include add-on fees known as `` points.'' Also, the bank board averages do no reflect changes over the past month. The bank board said rates, including points, for the most popular type of one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages _ those with caps on how high the rates can increase _ rose for the third month in a row from 8.80 percent in early June to 8.86 percent in early July.

 Angolan rebels killed 42 government troops in three clashes this week, ignoring a cease-fire declared by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the 13-year Angolan war, the group said Friday. Also on Friday, the official Angolan news agency said Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON> met to discuss the cease-fire, which was declared Monday. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> said the Thurdsay meeting in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, the Angolan capital, also covered several unspecified bilateral issues. The report, distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, did not elaborate. In a military statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, the rebel Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said it killed 10 soldiers Wednesday in an ambush on an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> battalion just northwest of <LOCATION> Kuemba </LOCATION> in the central province of <LOCATION> Bie </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, rebels ambushed government troops on a road near <LOCATION> Tomboko </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> province, killing seven soldiers, the statement said. It said rebels killed 25 more soldiers Monday in a battle near <LOCATION> Chipendo </LOCATION> in the southwestern province of <LOCATION> Huila </LOCATION>. Two guerrillas died and nine others were injured in the clashes, the statement said. There was no independent confirmation of the claims. The rebels, with the backing of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have fought since 1975 to force the Cuban and Soviet-backed Marxist government to share power in the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. They are not a party to the cease-fire. Monday's cease-fire was the first step in a three-way peace agreement to end war in the region, achieve a withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and create an independent state in neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which now is controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON> is a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo and headed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s delegation to ongoing peace talks between the three countries Another round is set to be held later this month.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Extends Amnesty Deadline For Thousands Of Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has agreed to extend the deadline for amnesty applications so that as many as 100,000 immigrants who failed to apply because of confusion over a restriction can seek legalization. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said at a hearing Wednesday he would issue a formal ruling ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to extend the amnesty program until Nov. 30 for one group of immigrants. His decision is aimed at immigrants, including large numbers of Asians, Europeans and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, who were rejected or discouraged from applying because of an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> rule that initially disqualified people who traveled outside the country after the January 1982 amnesty-eligibility deadline and then re-entered with legal visas. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> rescinded the policy midway through the one-year amnesty program. `` We believe that thousands of people never heard of the change in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> policy and therefore did not apply for amnesty by the May 4, 1988, deadline,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schey </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who filed the lawsuit last summer. He estimates that the ruling could add as many as 100,000 new amnesty applicants to the 1.8 million who applied before the first phase of the program ended May 5. Government attorneys, who disputed <PERSON> Schey </PERSON>'s numbers, said they may appeal <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s decision. The case is one of several court challenges seeking similar extensions for different categories of immigrants who maintain they were wrongly left out of the process. According to <PERSON> Schey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s ruling is the first since June when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled, in a case concerning Filipino World War II veterans, against courts extending deadlines imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In a related case, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> on Wednesday reinstated an amnesty extension for immigrants who traveled outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the amnesty application period without <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> permission. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> had stayed an extension he granted in June as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, <PERSON> Schey </PERSON> said. `` This court ruling says that despite that <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case, the federal courts do have the power to extend the deadline,'' he said. Government lawyers remain unconvinced, however. `` The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> position is that the court does n't have the jurisdiction to order this extension,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, who represented the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in the case.

Two marble heads and associated hands and feet were removed from the museum's <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grecia </ORGANIZATION> gallery, museum spokeswoman <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said Thursday. Earlier this week, Italian magistrate <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffiotta </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he was investigating the theft of Greek sculpture from an archaeological site in <LOCATION> Morgantina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, and that he believed pieces of stolen statuary _ a face, hands and feet _ had turned up in the Getty Museum. `` No one has presented any evidence to us that they are from <LOCATION> Morgantina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said. However, she said, the museum removed the pieces because they may fit the description of objects allegedly stolen from the <LOCATION> Morgantina </LOCATION> site. The museum does not own the pieces, Ms. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said, adding that they have been on loan from a private collector and will be returned to the collector. According to terms of the loan agreement, the museum can not reveal the lender's name, she said. <PERSON> Raffiotta </PERSON> has not indicated the museum may have known the origin of the pieces. Last month, <PERSON> Graziella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorentini </PERSON>, director of antiquities in <LOCATION> Agrigento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, alleged that a fifth-century B.C. classical Greek statue, believed to be that of the Greek goddess Aphrodite, may have been illegally removed from <LOCATION> Morgantina </LOCATION> in 1979. Her allegations have triggered an investigation by Italian authorities and <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the Paris-based international police agency. That 7 -LCB- - foot statue, unveiled by <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> last month, is said to be the only acrolithic figure that has survived relatively intact from head to foot Acrolithic figures are composed of separately carved marble heads, hands and feet attached to limestone or wood bodies. <PERSON> Raffiotta </PERSON>, who is independently investigating the thefts, said he does not believe the Aphrodite was removed from <LOCATION> Morgantina </LOCATION>, but indicated that two other statues from <LOCATION> Morgantina </LOCATION> were on display at the Getty. He described the allegedly stolen objects as pieces of acrolithic statues.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> met Friday with a high-level <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation to discuss <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to cut official ties with Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said the talks centered on bilateral ties in light of the recent Jordanian move and proposals for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> government-in-exile, currently under discussion in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> two weeks ago severed legal and administrative ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> ruled from 1948 until 1967 when the area was captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> radio said only that Friday's meeting centered `` on issues of mutual concern.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anoymity, said the two sides discussed the status of Jordanian passports held by Palestinians, the rights of employees in the occupied territories recently fired by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and `` the implications of these measures on the future of Palestinians.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has scrapped a $ 1.3 billion development plan for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> strip </LOCATION>, canceled the salaries of 21,200 local employees and dissolved the lower house of parliament, half of whose 60 members represented the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But the king has not yet anounced a decision on the validity of Jordanian passports held by most of the 850,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>. More than half of the 2.8 million Jordanians are of Palestinian origin. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said the visiting delegation also was preparing for a long-expected visit of the group's leader, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Asked if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> this month, the official replied: `` God willing, he might.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on Friday for meetings with leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> about his proposal to pay the salaries of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> workers fired by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. A senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official, who also requested anonymity, said earlier this week that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> team would discuss the possibility of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s reconsidering its decision to sever ties with the occupied territories. But <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told reporters last weekend that the option of reversing the decision `` does not exist.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation has scheduled two more days of talks with Jordanian officials.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge said Friday the new fraud and conspiracy trial of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his associates could last at least a year, but the defense said it would try to block proceedings from starting in October. At a hearing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, lawyers for the political extremist said they would appeal Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>'s decision ordering a new trial. Defense lawyers also said they would seek more information about a February 1985 memo from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> executive assistant director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> to then-FBI Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> regarding an bomb threat against former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> that allegedly involved <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> affiliates. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five political organizations are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign raised more than $ 2 million through credit card and loan fraud. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>, who ordered the new trial Thursday three months after declaring a mistrial, said he plans to schedule daylong daily sessions starting Oct. 3 and pre-screen jurors to guard against complaints about the trial's length. `` In light of my estimate that this trial is going to last a year or longer, it's important to get in as many hours per day as possible,'' <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said. The first trial, which began last December, was suspended in March for hearings into government documents referring to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. Those included a memo from retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to then-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, now-declassified <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents on information-gathering against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, and other <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> records. The defense has maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> infiltrated <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations to fabricate evidence of fraud. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> halted all proceedings in May after excusing four jurors who complained about the length and conduct of the case. That left only 10 jurors out of the original 12 and two alternates, and the defense exercised its right not to continue with fewer than 12. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 memo and a 1982 telex about a bomb threat against <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> were irrelevant to the fraud and conspiracy charges. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcorn </PERSON> said the document was pertinent because it was written after the government began its fraud investigation of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and could be used as evidence to prove the government set up <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. The defense Friday also withdrew motions to divide the case into separate trials for the credit card fraud, loan fraud and conspiracy charges. Attorneys said separate trials could have prolonged the case even more because some witnesses would be called three or four times. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said he expects the prosecution will produce 75 hours of direct testimony. Adding cross-examination by defense attorneys, <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> estimated the case would take 300 hours, or about 3 -LCB- months. Defense lawyers, who in the first trial raised some issues several times, refused to estimate how long their case would take. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, one of about a dozen LaRouche attorneys, said defendants would ask the federal appeals court to delay the trial until their appeal is heard. The defense last month charged prosecutors with intentionally causing the mistrial because its case `` was going nowhere.'' Defendants had claimed a new trial would violate their Fifth Amendment rights against being tried twice on the same charges. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who is seeking the presidency a fourth time, is charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with investigators. All six aides and the five organizations also are charged with conspiracy, and four of the groups are charged with fraud.

 Despite doctors' fears that a 47-year-old woman would not survive massive head and chest injuries, she emerged from a two-month coma by speaking her husband's name and nodding to her doctor. <PERSON> Yung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> was struck by a truck June 2 when she and her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, crossed a street. `` I prayed for a miracle and it is true now.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s busiest drug interdiction team is delighted to have a share of $ 60 million in emergency money and ready to `` stir it up with the opposition,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. `` There's nothing worse than being on a ship that wo n't get under way,'' said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnon </PERSON>, chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Seventh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which stretches from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` The people in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> are happy to get back to work. We're ready to stir it up with the opposition,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday shifted $ 60 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help restore a variety of operations cut last winter. The shift was part of a $ 672 million emergency spending bill. `` I'm delighted with this action,'' the Seventh District commander, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniell </PERSON>, said in a statement. `` Now we can get our planes back in the air and our cutters out to sea where they can do their job.'' `` The budget fight is not over,'' <PERSON> Linnon </PERSON> said, standing in front of the polished white cutters at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Base Miami Beach. `` The $ 60 million is what we need to finish out the -LRB- fiscal -RRB- year.'' <PERSON> Linnon </PERSON> said the Seventh District, the busiest in drug intervention efforts, had to cut to three of the biggest, deep-water cutters per day and had seen seizures drop by half from January to August. Now, the district will be able to put to sea six or seven cutters. The district had already started to increase patrols in anticipation of the budget shift. `` We've proven over the years that it -LRB- increased activity -RRB- makes a difference,'' he said. The money will be spread among all 10 of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> districts and will go toward a variety of needs, including resuming training, replenishing spare parts, carrying out deferred maintenance and resuming patrols. <PERSON> Linnon </PERSON> said he has n't seen how the money will be distributed, but more than 25 percent of District 7's budget is spent on stopping drug traffic. `` I see this as an excellent signal that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will support the president's <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget for the upcoming fiscal year,'' said Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now that we have the $ 60 million we are ready to charge ahead.'' In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it was being forced to cut back anti-drug efforts by 55 percent because of a shortage of money. The impact of the cuts was most sharply felt in the Southeast because 90 percent of all <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seizures are made in the waters off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, officials said. During the cutback, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> averaged about 100 cutter days per month in District 7, but that number could double with the additional money. During the cutback, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had continued to respond to reports of suspicious activity on the seas, but had cut back on routine patrols.

 A prominent historian and an editor published open letters Friday urging the reformist Soviet weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News to condemn what they characterized as repression in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` When human rights are trampled underfoot, it can not be seen as just an ` internal affair,' whether this happens in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' wrote historian <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun </PERSON>, the son of <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun </PERSON>, who led the abortive Soviet republic established in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1919. `` By what title do we condemn racial persecution ... dictatorial regimes ... around the world if, in a <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> that belongs to the socialist camp, there is not even the semblance of democracy?'' <PERSON> Kun </PERSON> asked. He took issue with a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News article on the dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> over the alleged discrimination against ethnic Hungarians living in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.

He said an open, informative press should be able to express its opinion even if the Soviet government stays out of the Hungarian-Romanian dispute. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News recently started publishing a Hungarian-language edition.

 The next time <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s directors want to outfit actors for a cops' n' robbers epic, they should pay a visit to this tiny town, home of the nation's best-dressed `` We stand for spit and polish,'' Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a former military police officer, said Friday. The award has been handed out for 11 years by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uniform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> and Distributors, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> officers, working out of headquarters in the <LOCATION> Manahawkin </LOCATION> section of the rural, southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> community, bested more than 300 departments nationwide, said the executive director of the association, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepper </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> state police won the best-dressed state police award; the <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> won the top county honors, and the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police department received the award for best-dressed municipality with more than 200 officers. <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, with 37 officers and 10 uniformed, civilian dispatchers, took the award for best-dressed municipality with under 200 officers, and also walked away with the grand national prize. The department's uniform consists of slate-gray trousers and a midnight-blue shirt with matching epaulets and chrome buttons. All-leather accessories _ including the belt and holster _ are made of an intricate basket-weave design. A slate-gray <PERSON> Stetson </PERSON> hat completes the outfit. `` We have daily inspections, and we've sent people home if they do n't pass,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` If they need to change their trousers or get a haircut, they go home and make up for it on their own time.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> is an instructor at the <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police academy, and said he teaches his classes that `` 90 percent of an officer's effectiveness is determined by his uniform If he looks sharp and feels proud, all he really needs is some voice control and a sense of personal control.'' Even if a community can not afford fancy uniforms, `` you can still look sharp. A uniform can still be creased, be clean and shoes can always be shined,'' he said. <PERSON> Lepper </PERSON> said the manufacturers assocation evaluates entrants on image projection, ease of identification, reflection of the department's authority and professionalism, practicality and protection from weather and physical attacks. The police departments also are scrutinized on how carefully they follow through on their dress code, he said. `` The single most important thing is that a police department must have consistency,'' he said. `` We want every police officer to look the same.'' The judges included a master tailor, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police lieutenant and the publisher of Law and Order, a police magazine. The 56-year-old uniform association represents textile mills, uniform manufacturers, dealer distributors and accessory manufacturers, <PERSON> Lepper </PERSON> said. It also sponsors annual awards for the best-dressed high school or college band, and the Image of the Year awards, which includes uniforms from car rental agencies, airlines, real estate agencies and other companies. `` A police officer's uniform is extremely important,'' <PERSON> Lepper </PERSON> said. `` When someone has an auto accident or has been mugged or assaulted, it's very comforting to see a police officer's uniform.'' `` Of course, it's different if you're getting a parking ticket,'' he joked.

 The Nicaraguan government is withholding approval of the names the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has submitted as replacements for eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys who were expelled by Sandinista authorities last month, a spokesman said Friday. Other officials said the administration does not intend to replace Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, who was among those expelled, but instead plans to send <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoug </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> affairs, to run the embassy. As embassy charge d'affairs, <PERSON> Skoug </PERSON> would not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The officials, speaking only on condition they not be named, said it was doubtful that any ambassadorial nominee could receive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation before congressional adjournment on Oct. 8. They said Sandinista refusal to approve the envoys proposed as replacements apparently was in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expulsion of Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>, who served as chief envoy to both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> maintains that the administration acted beyond its authority in expelling a diplomat accredited to the OAS. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said a U.S.-Nicaraguan agreement calls for a reply to be given on visa applications for diplomats assigned to either country's embassy within five days of the visa request. The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry informed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> that this provision of the agreement had been suspended and that both the agreement and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa requests were under review, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Stalling on the issuance of visas indicates the Sandinista regime wishes to prevent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy from functioning normally,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police Say Chicago Arrest Key To Uncovering Pedophile Network</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A convicted <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> sex offender gave <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> police the break needed to crack a pedophile network offering sex-for-hire with young boys, court records show. Authorities say the underground network operated for about eight years, selling the services of boys, ages 11 to 16, for as much as $ 1,000 a session. Police say tips generated from their case have prompted them to contact the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and law enforcement agencies in <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> counties. They said they believe customers from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> became involved in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>'s clandestine organization for pedophiles. `` This is going to be going on for months,'' predicted Tampa Detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. So far, four people have been arrested in the case, which became public Wednesday. Three were Floridians. The other, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman on probation for a 1985 sexual abuse conviction, was arrested after detectives received a tip from a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> woman who became suspicious when she overheard one of her 11-year-old sons talking on the telephone. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, 57, had met the boy and his twin brother at least once before, according to charges filed by prosecutors. Detectives had the boys arrange another rendezvous, and <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> was arrested April 9. From <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, the case widened to three other men, including <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> `` Wesley'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Police say he is believed to have arranged sexual encounters between men and boys for years. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was charged with four counts of sexual battery on a child under 12. He pleaded guilty June 22 to two lesser charges of attempted sexual battery and agreed to testify in exchange for a 15-year prison term. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> had faced the possibility of four life sentences with no chance of parole for 100 years with his original charges: four counts of sexual battery on a child under 12. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, some adolescent boys in poor neighborhoods knew <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> as the man with a red Mercedes who flashed lots of money, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. He was convicted of buying sex from four young boys in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1985, placed on probation for three years and ordered to stay away from children, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, an aircraft electronics technician, was arrested June 28 in <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and charged with sexual battery, procuring a minor for prostitution and deriving support from prostitution. Prosecutors say he arranged to sell the sexual services of an 11-year-old boy at a hotel in March. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, 38, a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> car salesman, was arrested June 9 and charged with having sexual activity with a child. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, a paint company branch manager, was arrested June 28 and charged with two instances of lewd and lascivious acts in the presence of a child under 16. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is being held without bail. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> is being held awaiting sentencing Sept. 7. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> were each released on $ 5,000 bail.

<HEAD>Former Premier's Memoirs to be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former premier who was purged after the 1956 uprising and expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> says he and other Stalinist leaders of the 1950s should have been called to account for their deeds then. The political weekly <PERSON> Kepes </PERSON> 7 carried excerpts of <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON>' memoirs in its Aug. 13 issue, available in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Friday. The magazine said the memoirs are to be published by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> publishing house Kossuth and that <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> has been allowed to resume teaching, indicating he has been rehabilitated. <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON>, 66, was a political outcast for years because of his critical stand toward the regime and the party. He was premier under the Stalinist leader <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakosi </PERSON> in 1955, and kept the post when <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, pioneer of the 1956 revolt, took over the party leadership from <LOCATION> Rakosi </LOCATION> in 1956. <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> was purged after the revolt was put down by Soviet tanks in November 1956, but was able to find refuge in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, returning to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1958. He said he considers it `` an historical injustice that most of the leading persons of the -LRB- early -RRB- 1950s _ including myself _ got off unscathed. We were never called to account.'' But he also criticized <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who was executed in 1958. `` <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> committed a mistake by taking a political step in 1956 which at that time looked impermissible in the East European context,'' <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> had promised to establish a multiparty system and announced <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> and called on the West for support of a neutral <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a new government and demands that Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. On Nov. 4, 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks entered <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to quell the uprising. The uprising was sparked by popular revulsion for <PERSON> Rakosi </PERSON>'s repressive regime <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> indicated it was clear at the time that <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was destined to fail because he was trying to implement such radical changes `` when the Soviets vested full powers over him.'' <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> said the revolt was a `` memento'' for politicians and the public, `` rather than a model that should be followed.'' If <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> instead had become premier and <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> had taken over the party from <LOCATION> Rakosi </LOCATION> in 1956, `` we would certainly have avoided the ... uprising,'' <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> called for Soviet assistance in 1956 and was party leader from then until last May, when he was replaced by Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> has called for reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, including greater pluralism in society and more autonomy for social insititutions.

<HEAD>Order Extended Barring Sale of Videotape Jackson Never Approved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won an extension Friday of a temporary court order barring a suburban company from selling or distributing videotapes of his Democratic National Convention speech. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> extended a temporary ban and indicated he would issue a preliminary injunction Tuesday barring <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> Home Video from profiting from the former presidential candidate's speech until the whole issue can be decided at trial. The case is set to go to trial Aug. 30 unless the two sides reach agreement, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attorney. `` I'm pleased with the result,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` He ruled in our favor, on a preliminary basis.'' But <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an attorney for Oak Forest-based <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION>, said he would appeal and declined further comment. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was not in court Friday, contends the tape exploited his name and literary and oratorical skills, and hurt his livelihoood by diminishing his chances of selling his own tape of the speech. In his ruling, <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> agreed, saying there is `` more than negligible probability that -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- earns part of his living ... on his oratory.'' He added that even the defendants acknowledged their videotape `` will hurt anything <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tries to sell.'' <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Waleed </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and his attorneys argue that <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> did n't need <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s authorization because his hour-long speech July 19 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was a news event, unprotected by federal copyright law. <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> paid <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> for the rights to its coverage. But <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> said the speech `` is an original literary work.'' The judge added that the fact that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had waited to copyright the speech until after he learned of <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s enterprise was insignificant. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said Thursday that he was motivated to make the tape by money and the event's historic importance. `` I thought we had a hot-seller,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> testified. As for the suggestion that he should have obtained <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s permission before selling the tapes, he said, `` Why should our medium be singled out as the only medium to get approval?

This week, Mrs. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> _ at 91 _ won her 12th consecutive four-year term. She did not campaign nor did she spend a cent except for a qualifying fee of $ 767.25. `` I just stayed in my office and worked,'' she said. `` I did n't see spending all that money on posters and cards. I've lived here all my life and did n't see any use in having to introduce myself to the public,'' she said. She received 3,110 votes to 2,695 votes for her opponent in the Democratic primary, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON>, a 41-year-old legal secretary. There is no Republican candidate. `` It's as close a race as I ever run,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. `` The reason I ran again was that all the lawyers in town all came to me and asked me to stay on,'' she said. `` That was a great boost and I've tried to keep up with all the new laws to help them.''

<TEXT>
 Twenty-six more anti-abortion activists were arrested outside a women's clinic Friday, including the four people who drove the the protesters to the site. The total number of arrests in the series of demonstrations, which began July 19 during the Democratic National Convention, reached 381 with the latest incident. The arrests of the four drivers marked a new strategy for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police. The vehicles were impounded, and police said the drivers would be charged with being party to a crime, a misdemeanor. The 22 others were arrested as they locked arms, sang and prayed outside the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> SurgiCenter, scene of a protest Thursday. Sgt. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Denson </PERSON> said Friday's protesters would be charged with criminal trespass and obstructing highways and sidewalks. Twenty-two people were arrested at the clinic Thursday, including six who were charged with terroristic acts after they entered the clinic. On Friday, the demonstrators were under strict orders from their leaders not to enter the clinic. A spokesman said Operation Rescue, the group that organized the demonstrations, does not condone actions such as entering the clinics. Many of those arrested in the series of demonstrations have remained in jail because they refused to give their names, identifying themselves only as Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. On Friday, authorities said 160 remained behind bars. Six protesters had preliminary hearings Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and all but one were transferred to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for further proceedings. A felony count of obstruction against the sixth was transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A man who set out for his dental clinic and took an unintended 1,120-mile detour last month finally reached the dentist's chair, where he was rewarded with free dentures. `` I ai n't embarrassed,'' said 76-year-old <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION>. `` It could've happened to anybody.'' In fact, it almost happened to <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>'s friend, 80-year-old <PERSON> Deacon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, who agreed to drive <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION> to the dental clinic 74 miles away in <LOCATION> Pell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> took two wrong turns and had to stop six times to ask for directions. `` I got lost, too, but I was determined not to go as far as he went,'' said <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, a retired mill worker who had never left west <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> except for one other trip to <LOCATION> Pell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ended up driving 560 miles _ all the way to <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, before he found out how far off course he had gone. Police in <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION> helped <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> get in touch with family and friends, who drove him back. `` They told me they did n't think I'd better drive no more,'' <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I told them that was fine with me because I was tired of it.'' `` I was trying to follow the road this fellow took when he brought me up here the first time I came, a long time ago,'' <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> explained. `` I thought I could find my way back my own self. I got on that interstate -LRB- I-65 -RRB- and did n't know how to get off. I just kept a-goin', kept a-goin', right out of the state, almost out of the country.'' Joining <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> on the trip Thursday was <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION>, who was stationed in the front seat with a map of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> on her lap. When <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> finally arrived at Dr. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s clinic _ 30 minutes late _ the dentist gave his most famous patient a free set of dentures, with two gold teeth in front. As <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and the Huffs departed, Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> said they probably would be back in <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION> by late afternoon. But then, thinking of other possibilities, she added, `` We just may end up in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. You never know.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> legislators worked Friday to pass anti-corruption legislation inspired by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation that led to guilty verdicts against dozens of county officials, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were not in agreement. The federal investigation into corrupt county purchasing practices has resulted in charges ranging from extortion to mail fraud against 56 supervisors in 25 counties. Of those, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have been convicted, one has been acquitted, one died before going to trial, one died after sentencing, and another was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. The remaining ones still have charges pending. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prepared Friday to consider its version of a county government reorganization bill, approval of which would require negotiations between that chamber and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a measure Friday dealing with purchasing laws. The lawmakers were in their third day of a special session called by Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who took office in January pushing county government reform as one of the four main goals of his first legislative session. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were unable to agree on a bill during their 120-day regular session earlier this year. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> was state auditor for the four years before he was elected governor, and he assisted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in its `` Operation Pretense'' investigation of corrupt county purchasing. The county reorganization bill was endorsed Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after it substituted language in a measure passed Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with that proposed by state Sen. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> of DeKalb. State Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Renick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said the House version was `` merely the bill that we saw during the regular session.'' He said: `` It was heinous then, it's heinous now.'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> has claimed the `` beat system,'' still in use in 60 of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s 82 counties, invites public officials to steal. Under that system, supervisors maintain control over daily operations in their individual districts. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> has pushed for a law that would require counties to adopt the so-called county unit system, under which the five county supervisors would set policy and hire an administrator to oversee day-to-day operations. The purchasing law measure passed 118-0 Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would allow governmental bodies to buy items costing less than $ 500 and not have to follow the purchase prices set by the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> through competitive bids. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> worked Friday to incorporate purchasing law revisions in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the county unit bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill differs in several ways from that approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although both would mandate central purchasing and inventory control systems for counties. Both would provide for referendums in each county, allowing voters to decide if their counties would construct and maintain roads on a centralized basis, although the versions would word the question differently. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provisions would allow counties to hire administrators, but would not require them to do so. The chancery clerk could agree to serve as county administrator, or as purchasing or receiving clerk. The House language would mandate hiring of an administrator. Both bills would require road managers for counties choosing central road construction and maintenance. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would prohibit the county engineer from serving as county road manager. Both versions would require separate clerks for purchasing, receiving and inventory control, but lawmakers have said those could come from existing personnel. The 1988 legislative session ended with three-member negotiating teams from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refusing to budge in areas where the chambers differed, killing the county unit legislation. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> then vetoed a bill that would have given 20 percent pay raises to the state's 410 supervisors.

<HEAD>Attorney General Acknowledges Ban On Exit Polling Is
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A controversial <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> law prohibiting the questioning of voters outside polling places violates the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, the state attorney general acknowledged Friday. But <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Greely </PERSON>, representing the state in a lawsuit filed against it by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> to leave intact the remainder of the law, which bans any questioning of voters in a polling place itself. In a brief filed in federal court, <PERSON> Greely </PERSON> acknowledged the prohibition of exit polling is `` constitutionally invalid'' and said it should be stricken from the statute. But, he added, `` It is constitutionally permissible for the defendants to enforce the statute to the extent it prohibits solicitation of an elector within a polling place or any building in which an election is being held.'' The proposal to eliminate the disputed language, submitted by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, came in a case filed by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> just before <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary election. Exit polling is used by television networks to project winners in elections before votes are counted. The late Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON> had pushed for the ban after the 1980 presidential election, in which networks predicted <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would win before polls closed in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. On June 3, four days before the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> primary, Judge <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the state from enforcing the ban. At that time, <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> said the law is `` seemingly a broadside attack upon significant, traditional and cherished First Amendment freedoms.''

 Supporters of former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> were talking unity Friday after months of wrangling with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign over delegations to the GOP National Convention. Aides to the television evangelist said his name will not be placed in nomination against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and they promised no more than traditional convention floor demonstrations when <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delivers his prime-time address Tuesday night. His speech will focus on many of the issues <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has stressed during the campaign, including foreign policy and moral values. `` And there will be a call for unity,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, director of communications for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. She said, `` There are no plans to put his name in nomination. He will release his delegates.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who suspended his campaign on May 16, has 93 delegates according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has 1,998 delegates, many more than the 1,139 needed to nominate. The former presidential candidate, who has returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, also will campaign for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the fall, Ms. <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON> said. The talk of party unity comes after bitter fights in states such as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> over representation for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters in the state parties and the delegations attending the convention. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> battle was resolved prior to the Republican gathering this week. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaigns settled their dispute in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on Wednesday with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters gaining 28 of the state's 48 delegate seats. The solution to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s fierce fight was still being hailed by the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> people on Friday. `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was a matter of definition,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>. `` There's a feeling of harmony because of the fair treatment of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> delegation,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, former campaign manager for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> resolution `` the bellwether in making the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the party of the 1990s.'' <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>'s comments came as he released results of a survey of 250 <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters conducted immediately after the Democratic National Convention. It found 69 percent definitely or at least probably supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 17 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the rest undecided. Sixty-six percent said they would vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even if they learned that he had had full knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of a vice president, a major concern among conservative groups, may affect support for the Republican nominee, according to <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, but only if the choice is a liberal. `` There is a wide range of tolerance for vice president,'' <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> said. `` There's no evidence to indicate it's a volatile issue.''

<HEAD>FAA Eyes Mid-1990s Launch for Vertical-Takeoff Aircraft</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plans to accelerate the certification of fixed-wing aircraft capable of taking off and landing vertically so they might be available for civilian use by the mid-1990s, officials said Friday. The so-called tilt-rotor aircraft technology, which is under development by the military, is seen by some aviation industry experts as a key to providing short-haul air transportation in the future. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Adminstrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAtor </PERSON>, one of the government's chief boosters of the technology, told reporters Friday that the potential civilian uses for the tilt-rotor aircraft is virtually limitless. He suggested it would be ideal for short-haul flights in areas ranging from the congested skies of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to the isolated airfields of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Other aviation experts, however, suggest that the use of such planes, which are expected to cost at least $ 20 million apiece and carry only 24 to 30 people per flight, would be too high to be economically successful in the near future. The tilt-rotor aircraft is envisioned as being capable of landing and taking off like a helicopter and having a range of more than 300 miles when its rotors are tilted for fixed-wing flight. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to share development information on the tilt-rotor aircraft program so that once the military version is developed it may be adapted quickly for civilian use. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated the agreement will shorten the time it takes to certify such a plane for civilian use by as much as eight years. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> estimated that the military version will be ready for certification by 1992 and the civilian version three years later. Six prototypes of the tilt-rotor craft already have been built for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by an industry team that includes <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Helicopter and <ORGANIZATION> Allison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also announced that it has awarded the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> a $ 585,000 grant to conduct a study that would determine where best to locate special landing and takeoff sites for such aircraft. Additional grants are expected to be provided shortly in other parts of the country, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that as many as 8 million business travelers might use such an aircraft annually if routes are established that would take them from the downtowns of one city to another. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged more studies will be needed to determine the actual market potential, the cost per seat mile of such aircraft and how such aircraft would be integrated into the next century's air transportation system. Eventually, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> planners envision tilt-rotor aircraft being used extensively by commuter airlines to transport business travelers in areas where capacity at conventional airports is increasingly limited. In the Northeast, says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional administrator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a tilt-rotor aircraft eventually could take business travelers from downtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 45 minutes.

 A federal judge removed from a <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> case by an appeals court said Friday he wants to hear from the nation's top civil rights enforcer before deciding to remove himself from all government cases. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, during a hearing on his own fitness for trial in government cases, said he did not know how he will rule eventually. But, he said, `` I have made my mind up that I am not going to rule on my motion to recuse until I hear from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>,'' director of the civil rights division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> said earlier the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would not take part in Friday's hearing and would not seek <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s blanket removal from federal government cases. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is involved in two long-running civil rights cases in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ one involving the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the other involving allegations of segregation at the state's colleges. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> removed <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> case, saying his position against the government had become hardened. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, 60, was appointed to the bench in 1982 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. By luck of the draw, however, <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> this week was assigned the school case after the appeals court removed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge U.W. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Te appeals court said <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> could not be impartial because he had championed desegregation efforts as a state senator and civil rights attorney. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged the appeals court to remove him from the Klan case, <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said he wants to know whether <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> will object if he hears the school case. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had joined in the suit, which alleges race bias exists in higher education programs and funding. `` I presume the 11th Circuit Court is reasonable,'' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said Friday. `` They say I'm partial. If a reasonable person thinks I'm partial, should I sit on federal cases? <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>, appointed to the bench by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980, was among the spectators during <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s hearing on his own motion for recusal but did not comment. Three attorneys, who are not involved in either case, did offer testimony that they had found <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> to be fair and impartial when they had matters before him. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> said earliers this week that he was the victim of a double standard demeaning to black federal jurists. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said he had invited responses from a wide variety of legal and judicial organizations and individuals but had received only one, from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in which <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has at this time insufficient information to determine and no reason to believe that Judge <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s proposed general recusal is either necessary or appropriate.''

 The summer's unrelenting heat finally wore down Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s resistance to air-conditioning the Capitol. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who had vetoed a budget item for installation of air conditioning, said Friday he was `` acquiescing.'' The governor's surprise backing followed a facetious suggestion from Rep. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> that impeachment proceedings might begin if <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> refused to budge. Statehouse employees were elated. `` I think it's wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaughy </PERSON>, a secretary for Assembly Minority Leader <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelsen </PERSON>. Outside the governor's conference room, where <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> made his announcement, the mercury climbed to the 90-degree mark for the 30th day this summer. That was only 11 days short of a record set in the mid-1930s, the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Several times this summer, when the temperature soared, the Assembly has allowed workers in rooms that lacked window air conditioners to take the afternooon off. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, whose personal office has a room air conditioner as do a number of legislators' offices, told reporters he encountered a woman in the Capitol Thursday who told him she would `` be glad to pay higher taxes'' for air conditioning in the building. `` I've acquiesced,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said fears among the public that air conditioning the 70-year-old Capitol would lead to even lengthier legislative sessions `` is absolutely ridiculous.'' The reality, he said, is that workers' productivity drops in the summertime because the building is so hot and uncomfortable. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> estimated that the project could cost as much as $ 6 million. About 1,000 people work in the building, he said.

 Actress <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, whose grotesque character in `` Throw Momma From the Train'' won her an Oscar nomination and a following in the twilight of her career, died of throat cancer. She was 59. Her husband of 34 years, actor <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, was at her side when she died Thursday evening at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she had been for about a week, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaff </PERSON> said Friday. The actress often appeared with her husband in projects, including <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s `` Any Which Way You Can,'' scheduled to air Friday night on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>. She appeared in two Barbra Streisand films, `` Up the Sandbox'' and `` For <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s Sake'' and played <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>'s addled mother in `` Weeds.'' In `` Goonies,'' she uttered the line, `` Put that kid's hand in the blender and hit puree. Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>'s television credits included roles in `` The Young and the Restless,'' guest appearances on `` Hill Street Blues,'' `` Night Court'' and `` Knight Rider,'' and movies-of-the-week roles in `` White Mama,'' `` The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,'' `` Blind Ambition'' and `` <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>.'' However, it was her role opposite actor-director <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> in the dark comedy about matricide, `` Throw Momma From the Train,'' that put her on the fast track. After 37 years in show business, she became famous as the actress with the face of a mother no one could love. `` Some people say I'm not a very pretty woman, but I'm a very beautiful woman inside,'' she said when asked about her appearance. As the murder-provoking harridan of `` Throw Momma,'' the diminutive hunch-shouldered actress played her most tormented and tormenting role. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, as brow-beaten son <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lift </PERSON>, tries to arrange a swap of murder victims: He will kill his writing teacher's ex-wife if the teacher -LRB- Crystal -RRB- kills his mother. `` She became such a cult hero to young people after ` Throw Momma' that the kids would n't leave her alone. But she loved kids. She enjoyed it all,'' said her publicist, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON>. `` I loved that woman. I loved everything about her,'' <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said. `` I was so delighted over the success she achieved over the past year. She was a woman of courage and should be admired by all.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> was nominated for an Academy Award for `` Throw Momma,'' but lost to <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of `` Moonstruck.'' She will be seen in four still-to-be-released films: `` Dr. <PERSON> Hackenstein </PERSON>,'' `` Scrooge,'' `` Good Ole Boy'' and `` Homer and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>.'' It was the removal of part of her tongue during throat cancer surgery three years ago that gave her the speech impediment evident in `` Throw Momma From the Train.'' She began chemotherapy treatments when the cancer recurred in April. During filming of `` Throw Momma,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> was undergoing oral surgery and was enduring intense pain, said <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>. He said the actress never asked to be excused from work. In addition to her husband, Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> is survived by a brother and sister, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said. A private burial was planned in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, but the family kept the date and location secret, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said. A public memorial service will be held Aug. 20 at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he said.

<HEAD>Mecham Assails Impeachment Conviction in Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> predicts he'll be voted back into office by an electorate disgusted with the way he was hounded from office by the state's political establishment. In a book titled `` Impeachment: The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conspiracy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> claims the real reason he was impeached and convicted of wrongdoing in office was `` pure and simple raw political power exercised by those groups who wanted to remain in control.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had the book printed privately and began selling it Thursday for $ 2.95. `` It was clear that they -LRB- senators who voted to convict -RRB- did not make that decision based on evidence,'' the former governor wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on April 4 of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> predicted public dissatisfaction with the impeachment would lead to changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s makeup this fall, adding, `` That should pave the way to win back the governorship again.'' The next gubernatorial election is in November 1990, with the winner to take office in January 1991. In May, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was acquitted of criminal charges accusing him of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. `` In the final analysis, my error was not in what I did with the -LRB- protocol -RRB- funds, but in thinking I was dealing with people who had honor, integrity and the best interest of the state at heart,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said in the book. On Thursday, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> filed a civil suit asking that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> be forced to turn over the $ 80,000 remaining in the protocol fund to the state. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has insisted the fund is private money and is seeking to return it to the donors himself. In his book, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> repeated his contention that some establishment lawmakers, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, the media and business leaders banded together in a conspiracy to drive him from office. But he said they had only partly succeeded, adding, `` They have not been able to fool all of the people in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> into believing that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was terrible for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, a racial bigot or a mindless buffoon ill-suited to be governor.''

<TEXT>
 A deactivated reactor from the nation's first nuclear power plant will be floated down the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in October on its way to a nuclear waste depository in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, officials said The reactor, to be removed from the deactivated <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> Atomic Power Station about 35 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, is expected to be unloaded in February at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The barge will go down the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and up the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Although the reactor has been emptied of its nuclear fuel, filled with concrete and enclosed in a neutron-shield tank, it's classified as nuclear waste since it has been contaminated by radiation `` There has never been a plant this large decommissioned in this country,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ney </PERSON>, a nuclear engineer for the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Department of Environmental Resources. `` It's probably the largest single shipment of nuclear waste in the nation's history.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON>, executive director of Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, said Thursday that his agency has n't received word of the shipment to <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, a technology transfer program manager for <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse-Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company would inform states along the route when the loading date approaches. Westinghouse-Hanford is the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s technical support contractor for <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> The concrete-filled reactor and its enclosing shield, <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said, together about 1,000 tons and measures about 45 feet high and 18 feet across. `` You can stand on it all day long and you would n't come in contact with more radiation than if you were standing out in the sun,'' <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said. The plant, commissioned in 1957, was the nation's first commercial nuclear power plant. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>, the Pittsburgh-based power company, operated the plant as a demonstration project. They began taking the plant out of service four years ago. By June, the nuclear core was removed and the middle of the reactor, which served as a heat source for water that was converted to steam, was filled with concrete. The Department of Energy is charged with disposing of the reactor and converting the property, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>, to `` a perfectly usable condition,'' <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials are monitoring the process.

 A controversial plan to provide free sterile needles to drug addicts will begin in November as authorities try to stem the spread of AIDS among drug abusers, the city health commissioner said Friday. `` There were problems with law enforcement agencies, but we've worked those bugs out,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who expects the program to start in about 10 weeks `` They now agree with us that this is not an illegal program.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved the experiment this week, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. The progam will involve 200 addicts and last six to nine months. `` That's enough time for us to get a fair amount of data to enable us to draw some conclusions,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. `` If something goes wrong, if we are mistaken, we can stop things at any time.'' Needles are already distributed in several other countries, but no government agency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has such a program. A social service agency in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, however, announced plans in June to begin a needle distribution program, but the program has been held up. The use of dirty needles has become the leading method of infection among new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. If the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> experiment is a success, city officials hope to broaden distribution among the city's estimated 200,000 intravenous drug abusers. Sample blood tests indicate about half of that group are already infected with the AIDS virus. Some prosecutors and leaders of the black community are among those who oppose the needle plan, saying it will promote illicit drug abuse. `` The end is commendable, of course,'' said <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. `` But I maintain that drug use is unacceptable, and I do not accept the notion that we can make drugs safer.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reviewed the names of potential running mates with senior advisers Friday, asking `` a few questions about a few people,'' but said he has not made up his mind, a campaign source said. `` He indicated he has not narrowed it,'' the source said. `` We talked about individuals. He's still asking questions and seeking information.'' The source, insisting on anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his advisers he thought he would make his decision before he flies to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Tuesday for the Republican convention but was n't sure of that. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, one of more than a dozen people said to be under consideration, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday to ask that his name be withdrawn, citing his family. `` The vice president's job requires a lot of national and international travel,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` My wife could n't travel with me because I've got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not true of the other candidates.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is spending the weekend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mulling his choice and working on the speech he will deliver Thursday night in accepting the Republican presidential nomination. On his arrival here Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will join President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at an airport ceremony and then get on a boat to cross the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for a welcoming rally downtown. Leaders of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign assembled at his headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at 7 a.m. Friday to talk with the vice president about his search for a running mate. The group included <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, his chief of staff; campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>; pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>; media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>; press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>; former Sen. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, nominated last week to be <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, longtime <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> friend <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave no clue about his preference, the source said. `` He asked a few questions about a few people. He's seeking more information. He has n't made a decision and he's unwilling to say when he will.'' The source refused to say who was discussed or how many names were reviewed. Afterward, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for final preparations for the convention. Among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff, there were differing opinions on whether he actually has made up his mind but just is n't telling anyone. One official, insisting on anonymity, expressed the view that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows who he wants but is holding it back until the last minute. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, one of the prospects, said he thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should keep it a secret until Wednesday or Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said he is trying to persuade the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces it would be best to announce the running mate choice on Wednesday night after the convention nominates <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did in 1980 when he chose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, in an interview, said that making the announcement on Thursday would undercut the news value of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech to the convention Thursday night. It would put the only two big news stories of the convention in competition with each other for Friday's front pages. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said he would favor having <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> come to the convention hall, thank the delegates for nominating him and then ask their support for his vice presidential choice. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., a co-chair of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign who has been mentioned as a possible running mate, declined to say if she had been asked if she wanted to be However, she said, `` It's not going to be offered and I would n't take it. People who were contacted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and asked to provide financial data, include <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and Sens. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, according to campaign aides.

<HEAD>Health Experts Plan Campaign For Preventive Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international medical conference on Friday declared a campaign against disease that involves training doctors in preventive care rather than waiting for their patients to become ill. `` Man needs more than science alone,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> after a five-day meeting in the Old College of <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> The conference was attended by 160 doctors and health specialists and released the Edinburgh Declaration that was adopted unanimously. It said in part that medical educators must produce doctors `` who will promote the health of all people _ not merely deliver curative services to those who can afford it or to those for whom it is readily available.'' `` Thousands suffer and die every day from diseases which are preventable, curable or self-inflicted and millions have no ready access to health care of any kind,'' the declaration said. `` Such facts have produced a mounting concern in medical education about equity in health care, the humane delivery of health services and the cost to society.'' The declaration was supported by representatives of three <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agencies: the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Development Program. National ministries of health and education, universities and such funding institutions as the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gulbenkian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> foundations, and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> helped finance the conference. `` The message from this meeting is quite clear: Urgent reform of medical training is needed in all countries so that doctors involve their patients in keeping themselves well,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist and president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. He said the steps to reform doctors' training will be monitored by offices in six regions _ <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. With backing from the government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a site for the central office has been offered by the city of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said the central office will have a staff of about eight and an annual budget of $ 289,000. Followup conferences are scheduled in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month and <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, at the end of October, he said. `` We want doctors everywhere to concentrate on how to encourage people to take care of themselves,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> from <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, former head of the center for educational development at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want medical graduates to meet the needs of the people and not be content with curing diseases,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, said more than two thirds of the 14 million deaths of children each year were caused by such diseases as diarrhea, measles, tetanus, whooping cough and respiratory infection, and the victims could have been protected at low cost. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said 50,000 people die prematurely every day from causes that could be readily prevented. `` We have the technology to dramatically improve the health of people over the next 20 years ... but will medical education play its role?'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, told the closing session: `` We do need high-technology medicine, but ordinary people everywhere know what they want: To keep healthy, to feed their families and to have a city system that gives them clean water. I know it will be a battle to get those things, it always has been.''

<HEAD>Pakistan to Lease Retiring US Warships</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, long troubled by the naval buildup of arch-foe <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has struck a deal to lease up to eight of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigates that are being retired for budgetary reasons, officials said Friday. The deal, outlined to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, makes all the more final the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s grudging decision early this spring to suspend the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's drive for a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Although the ships are being leased and not sold to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ and can be recalled if needed by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> _ `` it would probably take a war for us to ask for them back,'' said one official who asked not to be identified. Lt. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was informed of the deal in a letter from Rear Adm. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of legislative affairs <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has 30 days to block the transaction if it wishes to do so, she said. The spokeswoman said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would be allowed to inspect nine frigates. According to another official who asked not to be named, however, Pakistani officials have been told they can lease a maximum of eight ships. A top congressional aide, who also requested anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was unlikely to intervene `` because the decision has already been made to cut back the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. fleet.'' `` The decision was made up here not to keep these ships in service because of the cost of operating them, so if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> wants to take on that expense, we have no objection,'' the aide said. The ships, because of their age and boiler plants, require a disproportionate number of sailors to operate compared with modern warships. According to Lt. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has yet to say exactly how many frigates it wants. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, assuming <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes along, will begin allowing Pakistani inspections of nine frigates in October, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> declined Friday to say how much <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would pay for the warships. But according to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the highest rental fee that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would be charged for eight frigates would be $ 6.31 million per year. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is being offered an initial five-year lease on the ships, but any agreement `` can be terminated at any time,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. She identified the nine ships to be offered to the Pakistanis as the <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schofield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, Page, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Callahan </PERSON> and Sample. The <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schofield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Callahan </PERSON> are based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON> are based in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, while the Page is based in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and the Sample in <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The deal with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is being struck five months after <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> leased a nuclear-powered attack submarine from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its navy. `` The Indian navy is getting to be a powerful force,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is naturally concerned and they're prepared to put forward the manpower needed to operate these ships. The American frigates being offered to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are of the so-called <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> classes. They were built in the mid-1960s. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced early this year in unveiling the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1989 budget plan he had ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to retire the 16 frigates. He said the move was just one of several designed to shrink <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces rather than maintain a `` hollow'' force that was n't ready to fight. That decision was stridently criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who resigned in protest in February. Two months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced it would decommission the first 10 of the frigates by the end of this year and the remaining six in 1989. The 16 ships are operated by more than 5,100 sailors.

 <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military rulers gave no sign Friday of accepting a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church proposal that they negotiate with the opposition about the nominee for the October presidential referendum. Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>, chief of the air force, told a news conference the idea was `` interesting'' but indicated he does not plan such negotiations before the commanders meet Aug. 30 to select the nominee. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, is expected to be their choice. `` I'll take it into account when we meet in 18 days,'' <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> said. Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, the navy commander, said after the proposal was made Thursday that `` it's too late'' for an accord with the opposition. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, indirectly rejected the bishop's proposal in an address to businessmen Thursday He said his government would abide by the 1980 constitution, which says the commanders of the three armed forces and the national police will make the nomination. Bishops of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> recommended negotiations because `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is becoming polarized and radicalized'' and the referendum might result in a virtual tie unless the opposition accepts the nominee, whose name will be alone on the ballot.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, led all candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in contributions from political action committees in the first 18 months of the current election cycle, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s campaign for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> collected almost $ 1.7 million in contributions from PACs between Jan. 1, 1987, and June 30, 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reported this week. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., was second, with $ 1.14 million in PAC contributions <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is also running a simultaneous race as the vice presidential running mate of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who does not accept contributions from PACs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON>, said the senator had no plans to stop accepting <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> contributions for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, does not accept them. `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said on many occasions he did not try to select a clone,'' <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s plans for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> contest `` were made long before this vice presidential nomination came up and he will proceed with them.'' The senior senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since January 1987. In that role, he is influential in shaping tax and trade legislation that affects business and industry nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said the senator's campaign also took in almost $ 4.3 million in contributions from individuals in the 18-month period, which combined with PAC money totals and other sources totaled almost $ 6.3 million for his race against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. That total puts <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in second place in contributions to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates, behind only <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who had more than $ 6.8 million. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has spent more than $ 3 million on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race and had more than $ 3.8 million cash on hand at the end of June, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> report said. He ranks fourth in spending among <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates and is second place for cash on hand, it said. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, meanwhile, has raised $ 587,319 and spent $ 582,745.

<HEAD>Parliament Begins Final Debate on Trade Deal With US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Final consideration of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement began Friday with parliamentary debate on one of 102 amendments proposed by opposition parties trying to scuttle it. The agreement, which would scrap all duties over a 10-year period and reduce non-tariff barriers, was proposed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and accepted late last year by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. It is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, but <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> now faces a much tougher job than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to getting the agreement ratified. Enabling legislation passed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday by a vote of 366-40 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give its approval next month. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claim the agreement jeopardizes Canadian resources and could change the nation's way of life. They want <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to call a general election, which in effect would let the voters decide whether the it should be accepted. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> need not call an election until his five-year term expires in 12 months, but Canadian governments generally seek a new mandate after about four years. He said this this week he wants free trade and other key legislation passed before he considers an election date. His Conservatives are expected to use their large majority in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> to cut delaying tactics short next week and secure a third and final reading of the measure next week. The bill could get bogged down in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s appointed second chamber that has a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> majority. Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to delay the bill until an election. Friday's debate in the Commons began with a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> amendment noting that the pact does not define Canadian boundaries, especially disputed waters in the Arctic. The government dismissed the amendment as frivolous and refused to join the debate. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> and a free-trade supporter, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week `` a major trade war'' could start if <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> does not ratify the accord. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, the Liberal premier of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, responded: `` It's the largest trading partnership in the world. I'm not saying there would n't be some hard feelings, but that would pass.''

<HEAD>Arrest Warrant Issued For Abu Nidal's Operations Officer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Swedish prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for a purported terrorist of the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> organization but he is believed to have been killed in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> last month, a newspaper said Friday. Police suspect <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON>, a Palestinian who had lived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> since 1986, died in a bomb explosion July 11 in <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, the port of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, hours before a terrorist attack on a cruise ship in which nine people were killed. News reports said <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> planned the attack on the ship City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>. He was said to be operations officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Abu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nidal </ORGANIZATION> group, which issued a statement disclaiming responsibility. Prosecutor <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonsson </PERSON> issued a warrant for <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> in the murder of a Swedish passenger because positive identification of <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON>'s body was not possible, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> reported. His office said <PERSON> Jonsson </PERSON> was not available for comment this weekend. <PERSON> Krister </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer, told the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> `` we are 90 percent sure that <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> is dead.'' He said police learned <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> only after the ship attack in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and a subsequent raid led them to an arms cache in a forest. Newspapers said documents seized by police linked <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> to other terrorist attacks. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> told the news agency <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has become a base for international terrorists, who can conceal themselves among the thousands who seek political asylum here. `` <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is popular because of our open society,'' he said. `` It's easy to enter the country illegally, to stay here under a false identity and its easy to leave without border controls.''

 A four-alarm chemical fire closed two busy highways near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and produced clouds of noxious smoke that injured at least three people before firefighters brought it under control, authorities said. A passing motorist was overcome by smoke and taken to a hospital for treatment, said <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>. A firefighter and a police officer also inhaled fumes and required treatment, he said. The blaze was triggered by a small explosion at <ORGANIZATION> Altus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a battery manufacturer, about 1 p.m., and about 200 employees were evacuated, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Meral </PERSON>, a company vice president. He said clouds of smoke, which also forced the evacuation of some nearby small businesses, were produced by the burning of a chemical called thionylchloride and hydrochloric acid. `` Essentially, breathing the smoke might cause some repiratory distress, burning in nasal passages, a cough, irritation of the eyes,'' said <PERSON> Johnna </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could cause problems for asthmatics or those with lung or heart problems.''

The blaze was controlled around 2:15 p.m., officials said. The Highway Patrol said Interstate 880 and Highway 101 near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> were closed temporarily. A massive traffic jam ensued, with motorists backed up for about 15 miles. At <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> a few miles away, landings and takeoffs were only slightly affected, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Marily </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Canada May Investigate Health Problems After U.S. Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GANDER, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s health minister said Friday his staff is ready to investigate why emergency workers at a 1985 plane crash that killed 248 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel now complain of mysterious health problems. Union official <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said firefighters, transport workers, police and other rescuers have shown signs of a rare blood disorder and other health problems since the crash. He said they believe the blood disorder could be related to toxic fumes at at the site. The crash of a chartered jet at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION> on Dec. 12, 1985, was the worst ever in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In addition to the 248 troops from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 101st Airborne Division, it killed the eight crew members en on the DC-8 operated Arrow Air of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a charter company specializing in military passenger transport. The soldiers were returning from a tour with peacekeeping forces in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. About 50 workers requested the investigation at a meeting organized Thursday night by their union, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are serving notice to the government of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>: you have the responsibility to your employees ... to identify what the problem is,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. Without an independent medical examination of everyone at the crash site, it will be difficult to prove the ailments are linked to the disaster, he said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudria </PERSON>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said at least 24 rescue workers were suffering strange maladies and a full inquiry should be made. Health Minister <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Epp </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> his department will conduct tests and `` do whatever is medically necessary'' when it gets a formal request from the union. The plane refueled in Gander and crashed soon after takeoff. A preliminary report by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said failure to de-ice the wings was the probable cause, but members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and other sources said the confidential report omitted evidence of a possible on-board explosion or fire. `` We have doctors' reports for some workers that say toxins were present but there is no proof that it was from the crash,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. He said Thursday's union meeting `` established that a very high percentage of people involved in the Arrow Air crash are now experiencing medical problems of a similar nature.'' `` The problems included high enzyme counts, blood problems, and cardiovascular problems,'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. `` There definitely has to be a link there somewhere.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader Sees Change in Government Attitude</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government recognized a foundation conceived by Solidarity, pointing to a softening of its stand on activists of the outlawed independent trade movement, one of the movement's leaders said Thursday. However, <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> said the labor movement still faces major obstacles in regaining legal status. <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> led Solidarity in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> region until the movement was banned after martial law was imposed in December 1981. In an unexpected move, the government earlier this week approved registration of a foundation conceived by <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> and other Solidarity leaders to help large families in need, <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> said. `` I was completely surprised. I did n't expect such a decision. It's certainly connected with a general trend of change toward Solidarity activists,'' he said. <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> said government registration of a health care foundation now being organized by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would represent an even greater step in the trade group's efforts to regain legal status. `` Registration of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>'s foundation, connected even in name with Solidarity, will be a huge step toward legalization of the whole Solidarity,'' said <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>. The foundation's plans to operate three health care clinics have been delayed because the government had refused to recognize it. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> declined to discuss the future of the foundation. Worker protests in August 1980 led to creation of Solidarity, the only free trade union movement in the Soviet bloc. While Solidarity activists continue to fight court battles to restore the movement's legal status at the factory level, the group's leaders are trying to create foundations to help Polish society with money received as gifts or prizes from abroad. The courts so far have refused every factory-level request to restore legal status to Solidarity itself. Last year, <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> shared the annual human rights award of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which carries a prize of $ 40,000. <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>'s foundation for needy families initially will dispose of about $ 2,200. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and other Solidarity leaders authorized creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> last year to administer a $ 1 million grant from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republicans approved convention rule changes Friday they hope will get them more exposure on television: dispensing with needless roll call votes and allowing governors and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the convention floor. Unlike the Democrats, Republicans do not automatically give delegate status to high-ranking elected officials, and under current rules the convention floor seating is restricted to the delegates. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., said it would be good to let the politicians be seated on the floor of the convention so they could `` rub elbows with the backbone of the party. But it's the reporters and the TV cameras that the politicians are interested in. `` That's where the press is,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, who sponsored the change to allow the politicians to have non-voting seats on the convention floor. `` That's what we need to get elected.'' The rule change, if given final approval by the entire convention, would not take effect until 1992. The other change, which would dispense with an hour-long roll call for the vice presidential nomination if there is just one candidate, was designed to conserve precious prime time on the TV. That rule change, requested by Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, takes immediate effect if approved by the convention and would allow the Republicans to forego a Thursday night roll call next week.

 Anti-communist Afghan guerrillas have captured <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, a strategic provincial capital in northeastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to an unconfirmed report cited Friday by Western diplomats. The Moslem insurgents, who usually are the first to publicize their takeovers of Afghan towns even when they are temporary, have said nothing about capturing <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> province. <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, about 150 miles north of the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, would be a significant gain for the guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government. The city, 40 miles south of the Soviet border on the main highway leading from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, would be the first Afghan provincial capital the rebels have won in the 10-year war. Most Soviet troops leaving the country under an April 14 U.N.-sponsored withdrawal agreement are taking another road to the border at <LOCATION> Heiratan </LOCATION>, about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and have been helping the Marxist government battle the guerrillas. The Soviets agreed to withdraw half their estimated 100,000 troops by Monday under a pullout plan that began May 15 and is to be completed by Feb. 15. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said foreign journalists and local Afghans witnessed `` hundreds'' of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers cross into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday. The radio reported that a Pakistani national was arrested Thursday for espionage as he carried two explosive devices in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the unidentified Pakistani led Afghan army forces to a guerrilla ammunition depot in <LOCATION> Caprahar </LOCATION>, six miles south of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> also said two Pakistanis were among 70 people killed during a clash between Afghan army troops and U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas in eastern <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province. There was no information on when the fighting occurred. It described the two Pakistanis as `` advisers'' to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> resistance organization said guerrillas who arrived about 10 days ago from <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> said nothing of the capital's capture or its vulnerability to an imminent guerrilla takeover. The Afghan News Agency, which claims to be a mouthpiece of the seven-party guerrilla alliance but is operated by members of <PERSON> Gulbadin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, also could not confirm the capture of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. The loose and often fractured resistance alliance is based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. A strategic gain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s resource-rich north would dampen any hopes the Afghan government might have for the north as a fallback position if it is unable to hold <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Western diplomats said <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> might have designs on the north after the government began heavy construction in the northern city of <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION>, appointed a deputy prime minister for the north and consolidated its fighting forces under a single command. Afghan insurgents temporarily captured two provincial capitals in southern and eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since the Soviet withdrawal began, but they were pushed back after heavy bombing attacks, Western diplomats said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has an estimated 2.5 million Afghan refugees as well as guerrilla headquarters, signed the withdrawal agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with the Afghan government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which backs the insurgency, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to act as guarantors. The insurgents have said they will ignore the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord and keep fighting until the government falls. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, said Friday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is fully committed to the agreement and a political settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said Soviet accusations <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had violated the accord were `` false, motivated and propagandist.'' The Soviets have accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of continuing to channel weapons to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said the accord carries the promise of the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the return of peace and independence and the safe return of refugees.

 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Friday that he may yet remove from office the <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> city councilmen who are defying a federal judge over an order to promote racial integration by building 800 units of affordable housing. `` We certainly will not rule out removal by any means,'' the governor said after meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and the editorial board of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. Federal and state officials, such as Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, should help persuade <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> to build both low - and moderate-income housing, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said The people of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> `` have to have leadership locally and otherwise that shows them the way, that shows them they can have this housing, that shows them they can do the right thing by the poor people without threatening their own property,'' the governor said. `` No one needs to suffer a loss to find housing for 200 families in a city as great as <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, the state's fourth-largest city, has a population of 195,000 If an appeals court upholds a contempt finding next week, he said, the recalcitrant council members should consider resigning. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said his role would be defined by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who found the city liable for segregating housing and schools for 40 years. `` It's his jurisdiction,'' the governor said. Sand also found the city and four councilmen in contempt for failing to endorse a resolution to build 800 units of affordable housing to break the pattern of segregation. Each councilman was fined $ 500 daily. The city was fined $ 100 a day, with fines to double daily. By the 22nd day of the fines, the city would face the total elimination of its $ 337 million budget. But a three-judge appeals panel stayed the fines pending a full hearing on the contempt order next week. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he wanted to await the outcome of the appeals court before taking any action. To remove elected officials is a lengthy process, he observed. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, imposed to oversee city spending four years ago as a condition of a bailout to stave off bankruptcy, assumed the reins of city spending. It could find the officials in violation of the control board act and set into motion a removal process, said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. However, he stopped short of saying it would.

The couple acknowledged last month's reports that as a symbol of their eternal love, they have had their names tatooed on each others buttocks. `` It means I really love this person and I'm going to be with her for eternity,'' said <PERSON> Gastineau </PERSON>, 31, who is attending Jets training camp at <ORGANIZATION> Hofstra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>. `` I can really call this true love,'' said the bride-to-be, who proudly showed off her ring, diamonds in the shape of a nine, reminiscent of <PERSON> Gastineau </PERSON>'s jersey number, 99. `` I am the happiest I have ever been.'' `` We want lots of kids, 10 of them,'' declared <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, who said her movie career will be secondary to `` being with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>.'' She had a miscarriage last May while filming in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` The miscarriage is one of the most misfortunate things that ever happened to both of us,'' said <PERSON> Gastineau </PERSON>. `` It tore us apart.''

 Gunmen shot and killed a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier Friday night as he sat in his car at a traffic light in this <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port city, Belgian and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials said. No group immediately claimed responsibility. But suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which on Aug. 1 stepped up its campaign against members of British security forces. The soldier was hit by five bullets when he stopped his vehicle at the traffic light, the a Belgian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Belga </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the vehicle had British license plates and pulled a trailer. A Belgian police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said initial details of the shooting were sketchy. But he said authorities were looking for two men about 25 years old who were seen running away after the killing. The police official said `` it was not excluded'' the shooting was the work of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The British <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, confirmed that the soldier was killed at he waited at a traffic light. The ministry statement said he was on leave from his unit in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and was on his way home to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Many British servicemen stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> pass through the English Channel port of <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION> on their way to and from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Identification of the victim was withheld until his relatives are informed. This summer, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks against British military personnel in both <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and on the Continent. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It wants to unite the province, which has a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority, with the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> began its stepped-up campaign against members of the British security forces on Aug. 1, when it bombed a barracks in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, killing one soldier and injuring nine others. The campaign continued with a series of separate attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> last week in which the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killed a policeman, two part-time soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> and two Protestant civilians who were doing maintenance work on a police station.

 Protesters damning `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' marched behind a mannequin dressed as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, carried crosses, taunted moviegoers and splattered a theater with paint and glue as the movie opened in nine cities Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, uniformed security guards checked the purses and bags of movie patrons. Guards were stationed at each side of the screen at the Ziegfeld Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where about 100 protesters demonstrated, including a man who denounced moviegoers as `` reprobates'' and `` homosexuals.'' `` I believe that as <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> sold him -LRB- <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> -RRB- out the first time, that <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> is selling him out the second time,'' said demonstrator <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an Orthodox Jew, carried a sign reading, `` Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion.'' `` We see it as an attack on morality and traditional family values,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said of the film. We feel these people who are mocking Christianity today would also be willing to mock Judaism.'' However, movie patrons vastly outnumbered the protesters in all areas, standing in lines by the hundreds and buying out the first screenings of the film based on the 1955 novel by Greek author <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>. Directed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, it stars <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> as <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>. Some Christians have branded it blasphemous for its portrayal of a doubting <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, who, in a dream sequence, has sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, about 30 people waved placards and marched behind a mannequin dressed as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> outside a theater where the early afternoon show was a sellout, officials said. One protester, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said she hoped people would be discouraged from seeing the film but did not think it should be banned. `` They have a right to see it as much as we have a right to be here protesting against it,'' she said. Although a demonstration by 25,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> was peaceful on Thursday, 75 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officers monitored the movie house where `` Last Temptation'' opened Friday. Vandals tossed paint at the Century Plaza Theater about 5 a.m., splattering the building and a glass-enclosed movie poster with yellow paint, said <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Munez </PERSON>, head of the firm that provides security for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where the theater is located. Police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said no officers would be inside the theater in <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> despite fears of slashed or spray-painted screens. By noon someone had spread glue on the floor in the women's rest room, said theater patron <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Drott </PERSON>, 24. The 200 protesters included children with `` I Love Jesus'' T-shirts who sang `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and mothers who pushed strollers with such taped-on signs as `` Do n't Crucify Jesus Again.'' One huge poster aimed at Universal's parent company, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The Last Temptation of Christ will do for <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> What Pearl Harbor Did for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>: They Started a War and Lost it.'' <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> taped a sign to her chest that said `` I Love <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> but that does n't stop me from having an open mind.'' She said she was raised a Catholic and her mother, a church choir director, encouraged her to see the film. `` This morning my mother said ` Go ahead, be careful, keep an open mind and make up your own mind,''' she said. Hundreds of people waited in line for the first showing of the movie in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which sold out. But only about a dozen protesters were outside the NorthPoint Theater at Fisherman's Wharf. `` I wanted to see the first show so that I could tell all my Christian friends that they can come see it without believing the propaganda that they are receiving in the mail,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. About 50 demonstrators gathered outside a theater in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the Rev. <PERSON> Nikitas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulias </PERSON>, chancellor of the 200,000-member Greek Orthodox diocese said, `` We have called upon our people to go with prayer in their hearts _ that God might anoint these individuals to stop showing the film.'' In <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, an actor challenged the protesters by waving $ 20 bills and offering to buy them tickets to see the film. The only takers, however, were four ordinary filmgoers.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll Friday put the presidential race at 49 percent for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 46 percent for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an evaporation of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' big post-Democratic convention lead. The survey Wednesday and Thursday of 384 likely registered voters had a relatively high margin of sampling error, 6 percentage points, meaning the race was statistically a dead heat. Four other national polls released this week showed support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dropping off from its peak after last month's Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with leads for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor ranging from 6 points to 14 points. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, boosted by good publicity, led by as many as 18 points the week after the convention. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did as well as you can out of a convention,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief pollster. `` It's not surprising that would shrink.'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> survey found most of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s growth in support among voters who identified themselves as independents. He said their movement reflected an ambivalence about the candidates. `` Fifteen to 20 percent of the electorate is lightly attached to either of these candidates, and those voters are capable of swinging back and forth,'' he said. `` Either one could be ahead.''

 Israeli troops Friday fired on three Palestinians attacking with chains, clubs and an ax in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, killing one assailant and wounding another in the leg, the army said. Leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two major political parties intensified debate on the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> after King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to cut <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s ties with Palestinians in the occupied lands. Friday's clash began shortly after midnight in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Mughazi refugee camp, an army spokesman said. He said the dead man, <PERSON> Riad </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandil </PERSON>, 23, had participated in anti-Israeli protests and attacks on soldiers in the past. The death brought to 240 the number of Palestinians killed since the Arab rebellion in the occupied lands began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been killed. Israeli military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said troops apparently caught the Arabs by surprise as they were painting anti-Israeli slogans on camp walls. The officials said soldiers opened fire when the Palestinians attacked the troops with clubs, chains and an ax. They said <PERSON> Mandil </PERSON> fled from the army patrol after being wounded and may have bled to death. An autopsy was ordered. Troops also arrested the third member of the Palestinian group, the officials said. In an interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces radio, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had to decide in elections Nov. 1 to pursue peace before arguing about the choice of an Arab negotiating partner. `` What does <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> want _ to take a peace initiative or to sit idly and let the Arabs and the Russians and the whole world run our affairs? If we do not take the initiative _ and that's actually what the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> proposes _ others will take it,'' warned <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the head of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he still believed <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> had to be a negotiating partner, despite <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s declaration that he will not bargain on behalf of the Palestinians. `` We have always thought we should conduct negotiations both with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians, as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is responsible for the main border and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are the ones who bear the main burden of the Palestinian problem,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily, Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc argued the `` only realistic policy'' was to consider <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state since most of its 3.5 million people are Palestinians. `` We have to object in the strongest possible way to attempts to foist on us a second Palestinian state to our east,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who has a wide following among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hard-liners, proposed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annex portions of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, saying most Israelis agree that much of the territory is needed for security reasons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has ruled out repeated calls by right-wingers to annex the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in response to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s measures Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> with a high-level <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> delegation to discuss <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s move to cut ties with the occupied lands. A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they discussed Jordanian passports held by Palestinians, the rights of employees in the occupied territories dismissed by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and `` the implications of these measures on the future of Palestinians.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' opened in nine cities Friday amid tight security that included guards standing as sentries alongside movie screens and theater patrons being searched. Thousands of Christians furiously objected to the film, saying it depicts <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as filled with doubts and lust, while some critics praised it as a masterpiece. Filmgoers snaked around streets by the thousands for tickets to the first showings, vastly outnumbering the protesters who turned out in several cities. Uniformed security guards checked purses and bags of movie patrons in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and guards also stood alongside screens in those cities, but no disturbances were reported. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an Orthodox Jew, carried a sign in front of the Ziegfeld Theater that read, `` Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion,'' while in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, about 50 demonstrators gathered. About 30 protesters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, waved placards and marched behind a mannequin of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, while dozens of demonstrators gathered outside theaters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Although a demonstration by 25,000 Christians at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> was peaceful and polite Thursday, 75 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officers monitored the crowds at the Century Plaza Theater and security guards checked purses and bags of movie patrons. Police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said no officers will be in the theater in <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> despite fears of slashed or spray-painted screens. Vandals tossed balloons filled with paint at the Century City theater about 5 a.m., splattering it with yellow paint, said security guard <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Munez </PERSON>. By noon, someone had spread glue on the floor in the women's rest room, said patron <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Drott </PERSON>, 24. Hours before the film was to open, a group of directors including <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> called a news conference to express support for the film's director, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>. `` We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity-seekers,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Badham </PERSON>, director of `` Short Circuit'' and `` WarGames.'' `` What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the Bill of Rights.'' The Directors Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was the latest group to enter the fray, which has spread from the studio lots to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to churches nationwide. Protesters have declaimed the film as sacrilege, saying it portrays <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as a deranged and lust-driven human, who while being crucified, dreams he marries and has sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and lives his life as an ordinary man. Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, urged Catholics to boycott the film, calling it `` morally offensive and repugnant to Christian belief.'' `` It is inconceivable to me that a person of faith in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> would go to this movie,'' Law wrote in the archdiocese newspaper. `` One way to be heard is by not going. Another way is to write the producers.'' But proponents say the film illustrates the central mystery of Christianity, showing a fully human <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> wrestling with doubts and temptation, then rising above them to accept his role as God's son, willingly crucified so the rest of humanity may be forgiven its sin. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, who portrays <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in the film, said he is baffled by protesters' complaints. `` I just think this is a beautiful, powerful, positive film. Some people that for the most part have n't seen it are coming out against it _ that I do n't understand,'' he said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> has accused the protesters of censorship for asking the studio to destroy the film. In a suprise move, the studio moved up the release date from Sept. 23 to Friday, saying it wanted the public to judge the movie for itself but perhaps also wishing to capitalize on the publicity. Church leaders opposing the movie have primarily been Protestant evangelicals and conservative Catholics, many of whom have refused to watch it. The <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> also condemned the film Friday, saying it `` trivializes the message and mission of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' Other Christian leaders, such as the Episcopal bishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said after a screening that they had no objections to the release of the movie, and some said it was an enlightening or educational tool. Film critics also had mixed opinions, some calling it overwrought and boring at two hours, 40 minutes, others calling it the most impressive biblical epic ever. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Corliss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> `` may have created his masterpiece'' while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Medved </PERSON> of `` Sneak Previews'' said it was ironic that so much controversy could be generated `` by a movie this awful.'' The movie opened Friday in nine major markets _ <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Universal spokesman said no decision has been made whether to add other cities next week. Several movie chains have refused to book the film, including the <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters, the nation's fourth-largest movie chain with 1,338 screens in 318 locations The company refused to say why, however. On Friday, The <ORGANIZATION> Wometco </ORGANIZATION> exhibition chain, which has more than 90 screens in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said it also had chosen not to screen the film. <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON>, chairman of Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Odeon </ORGANIZATION>, which is showing the film and is co-distributor, said supression of the film would signal the beginning of the decline and fall of the motion picture industry. <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic, says his film is an affirmation of faith that he hoped would provoke people to think about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a man confronting temptation. Based on the 1955 novel by <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, which was denounced as heresy by the Greek Orthodox church, `` Last Temptation'' has had a long journey to the big screen. Director <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON> acquired the rights to the novel in 1971 but abandoned the project because of difficulties in writing the screenplay. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>, urged <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> to read the novel while she was filming `` <PERSON> Boxcar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON>'' with him in 1972, and that began his 15-year quest to make the movie. During the journey, such actors as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> and even <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> were suggested for the role of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.

 A fire Friday that spread smoke through the upper floors of the 102-story Empire State Building forced 1,500 tourists out into the steamy city streets before it was put out two hours later. At least eight radio stations with antennas on the building were temporarily knocked off the air by the fire. The fire broke out about 1 p.m. in a utility room on the 86th floor of the skyscraper and spread up a shaft to the top floor, the Fire Department said. Three firefighters required treatment for heat and smoke in the 93-degree weather, and one was taken to a hospital, said fire spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>. One building occupant suffered a cut on the arm but declined threatment, he said. `` It was really nothing unusual _ just very smoky and very hot,'' said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, acting fire chief. There was no general evacuation and no one was trapped, but people from the smokier upper floors were brought out. Elevator service was not disrupted. Some 1,500 tourists visiting the popular observation decks on the 86th and 102nd floors were among those told to leave the building, said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavatoro </PERSON>, a spokesman for the building owners. He said the decks would reopen Saturday. Fifth Avenue traffic was backed up for more than 20 blocks north of 34th Street. The Fire Department had 40 trucks and 125 firefighters at the scene. `` There was lots and lots of smoke, but that's all. It was coming out the vents,'' said <PERSON> Tracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, who works on the 65th floor. `` Everyone was kind of nervous. But there was no problem getting out,'' said a co-worker, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mial </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> described damage as moderate in the utility shaft. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, general manager and vice president of WLTW-FM, said the eight radio stations knocked off the air resumed broadcasting by 6 p.m. at reduced power. He said they would remain at reduced power until burned transmission lines were repaired. The 86th floor blaze was under control at 1:43 p.m., the fire department said, but five minutes later, fire was discovered on the top floor. Efforts to put it out were stymied for a time by lack of pressure because a pump on the 84th floor was not working properly, officials said. `` The greatest difficulty up there was the extreme heat and humidity,'' a sweat-soaked firefighter, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Keisey </PERSON>, said as he left the skyscraper. `` At times it felt like we were on our last legs.'' The Empire State Building is probably best-known as the site where movie ape King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON> made his last stand. Its most serious real-life disaster occurred July 28, 1945, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> B25 bomber, lost over <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in fog, crashed into the building's 79th floor. Three plane crewmen and 11 civilians died and 26 were injured as flaming gasoline bathed the 78th and 79th floors that Saturday. The structure, built in 1930-31, for years was the tallest building in the world.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> swapped charges on the economy Friday while Republicans finessed a disagreement over <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> in completing a conservative platform the vice president will take from next week's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention into the fall campaign. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said the platform reflected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a `` new direction'' in some areas Still, he added, `` We're a conservative political party. We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the ` c' word. But <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, a top aide to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> the Republicans had produced `` a right-wing platform mired in the past.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with advisers to discuss topic No. 1 on the minds of Republicans _ his choice of a running mate _ but offered no public clue. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> announced he did not wish to be considered for the post. `` The vice president's job requires a lot of national and international travel,'' he said. `` My wife could n't travel with me because I've got a 10-year-old in school ...'' An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a statistical dead heat, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at 49 percent support and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 46, a margin smaller than the poll's six-point margin of error. Several other polls this week have reported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading, although by less than in the days following the Democratic Convention. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were pointing their efforts toward next week _ the vice president by previewing the convention themes of peace and prosperity and his Democratic rival by airing the first television commercials of the fall campaign in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a bid to take the sting out of an attack the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> will launch against him from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make a dramatic announcement of his choice of a running mate Wednesday night after the convention bestows its presidential nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been saying he would wait until Thursday morning to announce his decision and would not tell `` a soul'' in advance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration loyalists he stands for `` low taxes and high opportunity'' for all and accused Democrats of favoring policies that would doom the economic recovery. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, completing a five-state campaign sweep, fired back that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> `` borrowing and spending'' caused this week's rise in interest rates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said climbing interest rates were an `` irresponsibility tax'' forced on Americans by deficit spending of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. `` ... We deserve an explanation from the Republicans at that convention about what they're doing to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. Heat, humidity and elephants of all shapes and sizes were in abundance in the convention city, where Republicans will flock next week to nominate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his vice presidential partner. One red, white and blue inflated plastic pachyderm was anchored atop a hotel overlooking the vast Superdome convention hall. The politicians were n't the only ones looking forward to the convention. `` There are going to be a lot of men at this convention, they said, so it'll be good for us,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a dancer at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> go-go club. Republican platform writers completed a 30,000 work blueprint for the future that they said was far more specific than the one approved by the Democrats last month. Officials released a list of 125 issues that they said Democrats had ignored. Republicans sidestepped a dispute over <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> when the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces agreed to accept a draft penned by conservatives that called for `` rapid and certain deployment'' of the missile defense system. The platform also rules out higher taxes and expresses firm opposition to abortion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> staged a joint appearance before Cabinet officers and senior appointees of the administration, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealing for their help in the fall campaign. `` If we state in plain terms the case for low taxes and high opportunity, for a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a peaceful world, I believe we'll have another <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> victory in November,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the `` <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> or <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> or Mondale Democrats ... are just itching to get back into the game ... `` Given the chance, I am convinced that they would repeal the tax cuts that we've worked so hard to enact and defend, and that would defeat and simply bury this recovery,'' he said. `` Measure us by our performance. Peace is breaking out all over the world. Earlier this week, on the same day, the headlines announced not one, but two cease-fires in very troubled areas of the world _ one between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and one between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would crisscross the country this fall to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The other folks talk; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deliver. The truth is that what we've achieved is just the beginning, the best is yet to come,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, stepped up his criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration spending policies and said interest rates will continue to rise `` if we continue to live on a credit card. `` As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to the door,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been criticized in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> because he opposes construction of two new <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supercarrier task forces which would be built at the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, shipyard. Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> said he parted company with the presidential candidate on that point but added, `` I have no doubts, no reservations and no hesitations,'' about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on his commitment to national security. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides also said the campaign was airing the first television commercials of the general election campaign in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the three days leading up to the Republican National Convention. `` By working together to create opportunity and a good life for all, all of us are enriched _ not just in economic terms, but as citizens and as human beings,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says in the ad. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appealed to Hispanic voters for support as he began a week-long stint of double-duty campaigning in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is seeking re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as well as running for vice president.

 Typhoon related floods and torrential rains have killed at least 1,406 Chinese this summer, an official report said Friday quoting a government spokesman. The spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> said more than 17.3 million acres of farmland have been flooded, causing $ 1.2 billion in economic losses, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It did not say how this year's disaster toll compared with those of past years. However, the loss of life is believed to be the heaviest since 1981 when 3,000 residents were reported killed by floods in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. Since the end of July, at least 264 people perished in flash floods in coastal <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province, more than 50 lost their lives in floods in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province and 110 were killed by a typhoon that battered <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>. The Flood Control spokesman, who was not identified, said the rains have filled reservoirs and ended a drought that parched much of central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But he also said some 28 million acres, about 10 percent of all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cultivated land, still have water shortages.

 Hollywood gossip broadcaster <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON>, whose career spanned <LOCATION> Tinseltown </LOCATION>'s Golden Age and entertained millions of radio listeners, has died at age 89. <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON>, who died Tuesday at <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, was considered to be the most acerbic of his contemporaries, who included <PERSON> Louella </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>. His shows featured stories about stars, movie critiques and his trademark sign-off: `` Good night to you ... and you ... and I do mean you!'' At his peak in 1950 <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> was earning more than $ 250,000 a year and was heard over 486 stations by 40 million people a week. His syndicated gossip column appeared in 360 newspapers. His show featured a four-bell system for rating new films, `` open letters'' to movie stars in which he critiqued their performances and their behavior and `` notes from the little black book.'' <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> took pride in being disliked by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and credited a network of spies for giving him gossip. `` I had secretaries in studios all over town who would supply me with stories for bonuses of $ 25 to $ 100,'' he once said. He wrote his first column in 1920 for the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a four-page insert to the old <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> was once a movie extra with ambitions of becoming a star. He first got attention as a publicity man for Famous Players-Lasky, the forerunner of Paramount. Assigned to <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMille </PERSON>, he reportedly once increased profits for DeMille's films by telling the news media that the movie mogul had loaded his yacht with rifles and was taking it to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to hunt cannibals. <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> later ran his own talent agency until it was wiped out by the stock market crash of 1929. He returned to public relations and was asked to interview a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> starlet for the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> radio show `` Hollywood on the Air.'' After more than 2,000 letters poured in praising the effort, he was given his own 15-minute show. He began to cut back his broadcasts in the 1960s but did n't retire from the air until 1983 He is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, three daughters and four grandchildren.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returned to his home state Friday to ask Hispanic voters for support as he began a week of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaigning that will keep him visible while the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> dominates the national political scene. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is a real battleground, that's obvious,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said as he arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> several hours late because of a delay leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In remarks prepared for delivery Friday night before the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said, `` Given the importance of the Hispanic community in this election, it is safe to assume that for the next three months you will be courted by both major parties. You will get a lot of attention and hear a lot of promises. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and a united, committed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will stand shoulder to shoulder with you,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. An advance copy of his speech was released Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the group, which works to increase Hispanic political participation, that its efforts already were being felt with a big increase in Hispanic elected officials. The large number of Hispanic voters in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which `` together have 76 electoral votes _ almost 30 percent of the total needed to win _ could tip the balance of power and elect our next president,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> asked the group in both English and Spanish to support the Democratic ticket this year. The stop in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> was the first in a week of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appearances designed to `` shore up the traditional Democratic support in the state, and turn them into believers in the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, the campaign's spokesman <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to join his running mate at the end of the week. `` I think -LRB- the trip -RRB- underscores the high degree of importance the ticket places on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> native who also claims to be a Texan. But the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaign will try to emphasize the senator's deeper roots in the state. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was born in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> valley. `` He is clearly doing something <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not do ... campaigning as the state's favorite son,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. By staying on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also will be constantly ready to respond to developments in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the site of the Republican convention. `` We know the Democratic ticket will be in for some sharp attacks this week _ they might even say some things about <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. `` We want to go back to our base and shore it up while we are under attack.'' After <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to visit <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> this weekend. A quick trip to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> was scheduled for Monday and then it was back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to join <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> late in the week for a visit to the LBJ ranch and other events. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> then will travel to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> next Saturday.

 A van carrying a children's softball team veered out of control and into the path of a tractor-trailer in a highway construction zone Friday, killing five children and injuring 13, authorities said. The victims were members of a <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> team returning home after playing in a tournament in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> van was carrying 14 children and three adults when the accident happened on <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 20 </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. A club spokesman said the children are ages 10 to 12. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the van collided with a <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> truck in a construction zone one mile east of <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION> where traffic had been narrowed to two lanes. Two witnesses, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanthorn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said the van was traveling behind the truck when the van's driver appeared to lose control. The van ran off the road, veered back onto the highway and underneath the truck, the witnesses said. The truck dragged the van about 150 yards before the tractor-trailer jackknifed. `` The truck was sitting directly on top of the van. The van was crushed ... very flat,'' said paramedic <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was at the scene. The truck driver, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbs </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, was listed in stable condition at <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION> with internal injuries suffered when he was thrown through the windshield of his rig. He was the truck's only occupant, officials said. Four of the injured were flown by helicopter to two <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> hospitals, and all were reported in critical condition, including <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, identified as the driver of the van. Six others were in stable condition in an <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> hospital. One child was hospitalized in <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION>, and another was treated and released. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the injured suffered fractured limbs, injured backs and internal injuries. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, regional director of safety for <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, said the truck was based in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> and was heading west with a full load to make deliveries. <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON>, education director at the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said the team had left <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> at 6:30 a.m. Friday for a tournament in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, and was returning home when the accident occurred at 1 p.m. <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> is about 150 east of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. Friday was the last day of the <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s summer program and the club was holding a party when word came of the accident, Ms. <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON> said. `` We were in the midst of our party right when we were notified of it. ... We just had to cancel our party,'' she said. `` It's horrible I just can not believe it.''

 A refusenik family was embraced by tearful relatives Friday evening as they arrived in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> after gaining permission to emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. `` I'm overwhelmed with gratitude toward all the people who helped me all the 11 years,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON>, and their 12-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, were greeted by relatives and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> activists who worked to secure their exit visas. `` We'll drink champagne and I'll put them to bed, they did n't sleep for two days,'' said <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>'s older daughter, <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatutsky </PERSON>, who emigrated in 1987 with her husband `` I do n't feel like it really happened because I was imagining it so many times,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>. `` It's still in a dream.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had planned to visit the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> family at their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment during the summit meeting to underscore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern for human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The visit was canceled after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were warned it could jeopardize the family's chances of emigrating. After the summit, the Ziemans were told their request had been denied again, but a few weeks later they were granted permission to leave. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, 49, a computer specialist who lost his job when he applied to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until he became ill several months ago. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> had been told he was not permitted to leave the country for security reasons. He contended he never had access to state secrets and had no information that could threaten Soviet security. The Ziemans left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday and stayed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> until they left for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khatutsky </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said her parents will stay in an apartment in suburban Belmont. A refusenik is a term applied to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> citizens _ usually Jewish _ who are refused permission to emigrate to another country. Among the gathering of about 30 people at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> airport was <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, Mass.-based Action for Soviet Jewry. She called the release of the Ziemans a victory for the refusenik cause but said much work remains. `` There are still people waiting 10 years, 12 years,'' <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> said. She called the decision to free the Ziemans, `` a P.R. ploy,'' for Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 Most doctors are not using clot-dissolving drugs to treat heart attack victims, even though studies suggest such treatment along with aspirin can dramatically reduce heart attack deaths, say participants in the latest study. `` Our object is to get the results of this treatment widely known so people will get this treatment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sleight </PERSON>, chairman of the new study's steering committee. On Thursday, Sleight and his colleagues reported that giving an aspirin and a clot-dissolving drug within 24 hours of the onset of a heart attack can reduce the death rate over the following five weeks from 13 percent to 8 percent. This should now be considered standard treatment, the doctors said.

The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Producer Price Index, which tracks prices for finished products one step before the retail level, rose 0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in June.

 Virus-killing blood cells vary widely from person to person in the way they recognize the AIDS virus and easily lose their memory for the microbe, making an AIDS vaccine very difficult if not impossible, according to new research. Early attempts at making AIDS vaccines have failed to prompt blood cells known as B cells to make antibodies that wipe out the virus. Some experts contend that for a vaccine to work, it must activate the other main branch of the body's immune defenses, the T cells. However, the latest research suggests important obstacles to building a vaccine that rallies T cells to give life-long protection against the many strains of human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.

 Intravenous drug abusers changed their practices after community workers started warning about AIDS, but even users in treatment have immune system troubles that may hinder their fighting off the disease, two studies reported Friday suggest.

The work was presented Friday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The change in drug practices is significant because drug users are often thought not responsive to health warnings, said researcher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Watters </PERSON>.

<HEAD>U.S. Soldiers Help German Farmers Harvest Crops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When it is harvest time in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers switch from jeeps and tanks to harvesters and threshers. This summer, about 80 soldiers stationed in southern <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are helping local farmers bring in their crops. Young soldiers like Pfc. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, are participating in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> program to work a week or two on nearby farms. Like his colleagues, <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON> volunteered for the work, which is counted as a temporary duty assignment and not furlough time, but to the GIs it's like a vacation. `` To me, working on the land is fun,'' <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON> said. `` Apart from that, I can sleep longer here than I can at the barracks.'' <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> public affairs spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Heilbronn </LOCATION>, said the program started about 10 to 15 years ago, with the intent to build better relations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and local people. `` It has been a really successful program, with interest growing both on the part of the local farmers and among the young recruits,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Each year the program, which runs from the beginning of August to the end of October, draws an increasing number of young enlistees, many of whom come from big cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and have never had a farm experience.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials see the project as a way of improving relations between the 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the local population. These relations can be strained at times. Most recently, many West Germans have been complaining about low-level training flights by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military jets. The stationing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intermediate-range nuclear missiles as part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense force in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> set off frequent, sometimes violent demonstrations outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the early 1980s. These tensions have diminished, however, with the signing in December of the U.S.-Soviet treaty that will remove the missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Heilbronn </LOCATION> works with local farmers' associations to publicize the harvesting program and to find places among the local family farms for the soldiers <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said the soldiers are not required to have previous farm experience, so long as they are motivated and eager to try. For the German farmers, the additional hands come inexpensively. They need only provide room and board. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military pays the rest. To farmers like <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldburg </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>'s German host, the extra help is welcome. `` My family and I live and work the entire year just for and from the harvest. Since our farm does not carry livestock, we earn our income only from the grain harvest,'' <PERSON> Waldburg </PERSON> said. As they steer cropping and threshing machines through the dusty wheat and corn fields, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers need little knowledge of the German language to harvest the grains. <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, however, had no language difficulties since his host family speaks English. He is also accustomed to farmwork, having helped out on his uncle's 6,000-acre farm in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waldburg </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>'s efforts. `` He is not only ambitious, he also understands something of his work.'' Both spokeswoman <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and farmer <PERSON> Waldburg </PERSON> agree that the program's success has helped foster good relations between military and community. `` Many times the host family and the soldier will call up and ask for an extension,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` A bond is formed, and often the soldier will go back to visit the family at Christmas and Easter.'' <PERSON> Waldburg </PERSON>, who was himself an exchange student in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in his youth, also is positive about the program. `` I have only had the best experiences with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers in the past years,'' he said. `` It is with programs like this that real friendship is built.''

Yet this curious collection of princes, bishops, dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons seems to be staging a miraculous deathbed recovery. Not only has the upper house beaten its elected partner, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, in the race to be televised, it also is handing legislative defeats to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at more than double the rate sustained by any Conservative government since World War II. Those who despair of thwarting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s radical capitalist reforms in the Commons look increasingly to the Lords, where most seats pass from father to son. The peers, who are not elected and serve for life, can vote against the government with no fear of party discipline. The Lords, top-heavy with conservative landowners, ought to be the natural ally of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives. Yet it is the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sworn enemy of inherited privilege, that is benefitting most from the Lords' independence of mind. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 101-seat majority in the 650-member Commons guarantees that bills pass in the lower chamber. But in the Lords she has suffered 127 defeats since coming to office in 1979. In recent years the peers have opposed the abolition of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s left-wing local government, rescued free eye and dental checkups, restored free school transport in rural areas, stopped corporal punishment in state schools, toned down a bill to abolish university tenure, curbed the expansion of police stop-and-search powers The Commons still has the last word, and some measures, including abolition of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> authority, ultimately become law despite the Lords' resistance, but almost always with compromise amendments. `` By and large the two houses have learned to live with each other and the broad effect is that a lot of amendments made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> get accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Belstead </PERSON>, the Lords' Conservative leader. Lords-watchers now are divided into two camps: those who say a house based on inherited privilege is bad, and those who say it's bad but ... <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a columnist in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper, says the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> relieves pressure for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to have an elected upper chamber, like the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` It is proof that of all the democracies, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the most backward,'' argues Young. Lord <PERSON> Ponsonby </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s chief whip, calls the hereditary principle `` an intolerable affront to democracy.'' But <PERSON> Ponsonby </PERSON>, himself a peer by inheritance, values the Lords as a revising chamber where Commons' legislation is fine-tuned, and he acknowledges that the Lords today is `` the best ally of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the legislative process.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> lost the right to make tax laws in the 17th century, only in 1910 was it stripped of all power over money bills and limited to two years the time period in which it could delay a bill. The emasculation followed the Lords' veto of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> LLoyd </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s liberal `` budget for the people,'' and most assumed that the Lords, having thrown their reactionary weight about once too often, would soon be scrapped altogether. Their power to delay a bill was cut to one year in 1949. The creation of new peers remains a potent tool of government patronage. <PERSON> Belstead </PERSON> maintains the Lords has opened up to new walks of life _ actors, small businessmen, trade unionists, and women. But of the 1,191 peers, 759 are there by inheritance, only 10 of them Laborites. All but four are white, all but 66 are men, and 446 are Conservatives to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 117 and the centrist parties' 87. The remainder are independents or declare no political affiliation. Only about 300 peers attend debates regularly, and in May the government had to summon non-attenders to ensure passage of a controversial property tax bill. The turnout of 509 was the second biggest this century. The key to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s defeats have been regular attenders among the 266 independents, the `` crossbenchers.'' <PERSON> Belstead </PERSON>, 55, a lanky former schoolteacher who inherited his father's title in 1958, has no ready answer to why the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> survives. In an interview, he focused on the Lords' function as a revising chamber, noting that peers work long hours and draw only 52-pounds -LRB- $ 88 -RRB- for each session attended, plus expenses. The chamber also provides the Law Lords, nine ennobled judges who sit as the country's highest court. Although they treasure their archaic rituals, the Lords boast of an openness to change. They brought in electric lights before the Commons, and have allowed their debates to be televised since 1984, something the Commons only now is planning. All in all, it's a relaxed place. It's still quite acceptable to fall asleep in mid-speech _ the giveaway is often the ear trumpet sliding out of the hand _ or to ramble on at length about grouse-shooting, leaky army boots, and what to do if Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is at the hairdresser's during a nuclear alert. And then there's the joy of dressing up in ermine gowns and two-peaked hats to welcome a new member. `` For one day of the year I was even prettier than my wife,'' remarked <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> when he went from being general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to being Lord <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Epping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Networks Still Confident of Stemming Audience Erosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the three major networks held their annual show-and-tell for television critics here, the question of the hour was what the writers' strike would do to the new fall shows. The strike ended midway through the critics' convention, and the networks are reassembling the 1988-89 television season. Underlying the immediate effects of the strike, however, was the longer-term and, for the networks, more worrisome issue of audience erosion. The strike's effects can only steepen the seemingly inexorable slide in ratings and audience share for the networks. Fewer people are watching the networks because they have more choices _ cable, syndication and VCRs. Two weeks ago, the three-network share hit its lowest level, and cable sees itself becoming a major player in the scramble to catch the eye of the roving viewer. `` You ask me what's going to happen in the next 10 years? You wo n't hear the word ` cable' anymore. It'll be ` television,''' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're not going to be able to distinguish between what was cable and what was the big three. `` I'm not trying to climb up the back of the networks. I think there's room for all of us,'' <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said. `` But we just do n't feel minor league anymore, compared to the networks.'' The network executives who spoke to the TV critics, while not exactly putting on happy faces, at least put up a brave front. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing, used numbers to argue that the networks are doing quite well, considering. `` We constantly hear that we are losing our audiences to the new alternatives and that somehow we are at fault,'' said <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>. `` The fact is that in 1980, the average American household had five viewing options. The three local network affiliates were three of these five options. In other words, the network affiliates represented 60 percent of the viewing options. The networks commanded 86 percent of the viewing audience. `` Today,'' <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> went on, `` the average American household has 20 viewing options. Three local network affiliates are still only three of the now 20 options. In other words, the network affiliates represent only 15 percent of the average household's viewing options Yet the networks still command 68 percent of share of prime-time viewing on a full-year basis. `` I, for one, do not think we at the networks have to make excuses for that performance.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, concedes the networks are losing audience but says cable has had it easy so far because its programming, some of it old network material, has been relatively inexpensive. `` As soon as they -LRB- cable channels -RRB- try to step up to a major increase in viewership, they're going to have enormous cost pressures of their own. I think they're going to have a very, very tough time,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Entertainment President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he was confident that quality network programming would hold audiences. `` If you have a successful program or a bunch of successful programs, you're going to do fine,'' said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has more successful programs than we do, and they're doing fine. ... I actually think the network programs are getting better, and as they get better, they're going to maintain share.'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>'s counterpart at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, sees a `` cloud on our horizon'' at his own network _ future absence of `` The Cosby Show.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> has said he would not continue the No. 1-rated series beyond this season. `` Cheers,'' another top-five show for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, is also likely to leave the air in the next couple years. `` I think we made the best segue in the history of broadcasting when ` Hill Street Blues' was in its last season, along came ` <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>,''' said <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>. `` So our hope is that we will have <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> next year. Our hope is that the ` Cheers' people will want to go one more and that the audience will want them to go one more. `` But the intent,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said, `` is to be in a flurry of development as soon as our doors open up tomorrow in the development of key 8 o'clock comedies and 8 and 9 o'clock dramas, because I think that is the necessary formula for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to keep this dynasty going.''

 Like others at the 1980 Republican national convention, orchestra leader <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> was nervously awaiting announcement of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s choice for vice presidential running mate. Rumors persisted that former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> would get the nod. For journalists, that meant getting copy ready on the former <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressman. For political power brokers and analysts, it meant consideration of the impact of a Reagan-Ford ticket. For <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who once again this week serves as musical director at the Republican Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, it meant making sure his musicians had sheet music ready for `` The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Fight Song'' and `` You've Got to Be a Football Hero.'' `` All of a sudden <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came out of the woodwork and everyone got caught short,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> recalled. `` I could n't think of where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was from. I knew it was a couple of places -LRB- <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` Then someone remembered that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. Ah, an <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaguer </ORGANIZATION>. Sheet music out, ladies and gentlemen, for `` Boola Boola.'' Once again, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, now 78, saved the musical day. `` We just got lucky on that one,'' he said. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> is playing the vice presidential blues this year on the downbeat of certain Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, in a recent telephone interview from his office, said he has identified at least 12 possible candidates from news accounts. And everyone has to have a song. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> may have only minutes from learning the name to playing an introductory tune for the nominee. He has a 700-song library to choose from. `` We try to figure out beforehand where the candidates are from,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` I know some of the different candidates from playing for them at various functions, and I know certain tunes they like. And there are a lot of tunes that still have fire to them but are n't regional,'' he said. That's important, because sometimes the official state tune is n't necessarily the one that a crowd recognizes, or likes. For the record, noted <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, the official state song of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is `` I Love You, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' not `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Here I Come.'' and for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it's `` The Great Big State of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' not `` East Side, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>.'' And folks are sensitive about that type of thing, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> has learned. `` I once got called out on the carpet for playing ` East Side, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>' for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. His compromise in such cases is a two-song medley, with the less popular but official tune giving way to the more well-known number. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> also has noted over the years a shift in the role of the orchestra at the convention. The orchestra once was used as a device to bring unruly crowds under control with the irresistible beat of a patriotic tune. Modern conventions, slickly produced and geared for television, have fewer and fewer items settled by floor fights. They depend more upon great sound, spectacles and split-second timing, he said. What's lost is the drama. `` Once in 1968 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, there was a floor fight,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who could not recall what the fight was over. `` Then it turned into a real demonstration, and things started to get out of hand, -LRB- <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Senator -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, ` Play something patriotic!' `` We played ` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,' and everybody had to stand up,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. `` But we had to play it three times before everybody calmed down.'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> native who has spent more than 50 years in the music business, including 17 with <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, where he scored and directed music for feature films. He also befriended <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, then a song-and-dance man for the studio. As the leader of the <LOCATION> Cocoanut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> became a favorite of Hollywood stars and worked on several films. He also became one of the movie colony's most sought-after orchestra leaders for benefits and galas. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>'s first gig as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> bandmaster was in 1956, when <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> carried the party's banner for a second term, along with Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. A 50-piece orchestra played at that Cow Palace convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> will bring 12 musicians to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and pick 10 more union musicans from that city's ample roster. `` Everybody's on a budget now,'' he said with a laugh. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who has also directed orchestras at several <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> functions, has declined over the years to reveal his political affiliation. He has played music at various functions for every American president since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> liked foxtrots, he recalled. `` He and Mrs. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> used to throw a lot of parties,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` They were always formal.''

<BYLINE>Safer or Saner? _ New York 25 Years After Last Execution
   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It seems an anomaly: New York state, populous,
powerful and, by virtue of its New York City appendage, also owner
of notably high murder statistics, is among only 13 states that
eschew capital punishment. Beginning in January 1977, when Gary
Gilmore was killed by a Utah firing squad, 12 states have executed
99 men and one woman. Up to 2,100 people are waiting on death rows
across the country. But New York state has no death row and
executed its last convict 25 years ago.

 For <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, the execution of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> in Sing Sing's electric chair on Aug. 15, 1963, was the 695th and last time it used the device of death it introduced to the world in 1890. Yet in the quarter century since, debate about the death penalty and its usefulness or offensiveness has no more faded than the state's murder rate, now well above the national average. Is life more precious in places where governments refuse to execute murderers? Are the streets safer? Are governors right to veto capital punishment legislation, ignoring what polls indicate is overwhelming support for the death penalty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>? In 25 years, the rituals still carried on elsewhere, concerning the electric chair, the last meal, the prison chaplain soothing the condemned, have been supplanted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with new rituals of emotional debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and among citizens. As frustrations mount on all sides of the issue, so do the murder statistics. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s criminals have not left the business of killing even while the state has. The state's murder rate is nearly three times higher now than on the day the 34-year-old <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> paid with his life for killing a woman in a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> bar robbery. Below the national average in 1963, the state's murder rate in 1987 stood at 11.3 per 100,000 people, compared to 8.3 murders per 100,000 nationally. `` Those who favored abolishing the death penalty said society would be more civil and we'd have about the same number of killings but less crime generally,'' said Republican <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON>, a former police officer from suburban <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest capital punishment advocate `` Eventually, they said, we'd have a more moralistic system. Well, clearly, the total and complete reversal has happened. We've never had such viciousness as we have today You have a situation today where our streets are more of a war zone than at any time in history.'' The chief question in any debate about the death penalty is whether it makes criminals think twice before committing capital offenses. It is also the question no one can answer with enough certainty to settle the issue. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, a Democrat who has vetoed death penalty bills in each of his six years in office, says the sentence has become a sort of cure-all for many of society's `` terrible, terrible problems.'' `` Just keep saying ` death penalty,''' he said of some advocates. `` Get them mesmerized with language. Hypnotize everybody. Just keep looking at the electric chair.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says there is no proof the threat of that chair deters would-be murderers; he suspects it could make some criminals more vicious. He also argues that too many people were wrongly convicted of capital crimes to feel confident in sending prisoners to their deaths. That uncertainty prompted the Legislature and former Gov. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> to abandon the death penalty in 1965, except in cases involving the murder of peace officers and prison guards. Later decisions by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the state's highest court, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, effectively wiped capital punishment statutes off the state books, and they was not restored after the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allowed states to resume putting murderers to death The way to lower the state's murder and crime rates is to provide better education and health programs, including efforts against drug and alcohol abuse, especially for poor young people, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says. To control criminals, he adds, law agencies must be well-funded and enough prison cells must exist to accommodate all offenders. `` Cost you a fortune,'' the governor conceded. The <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration's criminal justice services coordinator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poklemba </PERSON>, said the death penalty would not `` affect the vast majority of violent crimes that we need to do something about.'' `` The emergence of crack and the increase in the amount of drugs that are now on the street, the enormous amount of cocaine that is on the streets, is overwhelming the whole criminal justice system,'' <PERSON> Poklemba </PERSON> said. The topic of crack-dealing desperadoes is a good example of how vexing the debate can be. <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> and other death penalty supporters say re-establishing the punishment is just the message society must send. But <PERSON> Poklemba </PERSON> said the prospect of the electric chair means little to such criminals. `` They have <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> machine guns,'' he said. `` They're fighting it out among themselves -LRB- for drug-selling territory -RRB-. They certainly do n't care about a death penalty. The threat of being found guilty and being executed 10 to 15 years down the road is not going to be a deterrent if ... taking a chance of getting blown away that day does n't deter him.'' Aides to <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> say that under a bill that's repeatedly been before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the perpetrators of about one quarter of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's 2,000 murders a year could be charged with capital murder and sentenced to the electric chair. But the measure wo n't become law this year. While the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to override <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s veto, the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last month fell seven votes short of the 100 needed. While most New Yorkers seem to have an opinion about the death penalty, they apparently do n't feel strongly enough to make it the determining factor in who holds the state's highest office. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> before him both won election against pro-capital punishment foes. `` <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> are important for the proposition that political leaders who make it quite clear that they will not have the death penalty because they do n't propose to be responsible for official homicides'' can still get elected, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzchild </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the death penalty. `` While the public disagrees, it will also respect that.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is sure to be standing in the way again in 1989 and for as long as he's governor. But <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> says death penalty supporters will keep up their end of the ritual, too. `` I am convinced we will eventually override,'' he said.

 In a cramped gondola dangling beneath an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below, the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be believed. `` You have crossed the coast of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' the voice told three American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded others for 105 years. Silence. Then, crisply, `` Sir, my radar is never wrong.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, whooped with joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing in a balloon. The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later that day, Aug. 17, 1978, in a wheat field west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Today, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> is the only one of the three still alive. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed in a West German forest during a race. <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON>, then 53, died in 1985 when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said he has no specific plans to celebrate Wednesday's anniversary. But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10 years ago. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> recalled that after the initial jubilation, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> went to sleep while he and <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> looked down through the clearing clouds on the lights of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that drifted skyward. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> could hear dogs barking and trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below. `` Tears came to my eyes,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` I put my arm around <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I had n't felt that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.'' The men began the flight six days earlier when the Double Eagle II lifted up from <LOCATION> Presque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and headed toward <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> more than 3,000 miles away. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> says the flight was not without problems, including a clash of personalities. `` <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> later stated that he wished he could have flown the flight by himself,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with I did n't want to be <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said conflicts arose when <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> both began making key decisions. `` Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras and navigational equipment. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s hang glider dangled beneath the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over the sides in bags. `` There were many times the flight was in question,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> recalled. `` But how close it came to failure at each moment was interpreted different by each of us.'' They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted. Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said that at one point, a bit delirious from the altitude, he chucked a $ 4,000 radio _ and only later noticed a jar of peanut butter that weighed as much. Plans were for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> to fly the glider down once they made it to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But 400 miles from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, it came down to a choice of dropping the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a heater to battle <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON>'s frostbite. The glider went. Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to communicate by ham radio. `` The first guy I talked to would n't talk because I did n't have a license,'' said <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. `` And he did n't believe I was in a balloon over the middle of the ocean.'' Finally, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a home for the elderly somewhere in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` His call sign was ` G4JY.' I do n't think I'll ever forget that,'' he said. `` He talked to me until the last day of the flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the rough times were offset by the excitement. A high point, he said, came over <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> when a jumbo jet relayed a message from the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. The museum had asked to display the gondola and balloon in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s Spirit of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers' plane. In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> had landed 51 years before after the first solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over <LOCATION> Evreux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, they realized they could not go on. The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of champagne. They were 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, 3,107 miles and 137 hours from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> where the helium-packed balloon had taken off. The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola settled gently to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as cheering spectators abandoned their cars along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon. Hundreds tried to take a piece of history. `` It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` People were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.'' The French press dubbed them the `` new Lindberghs.'' But <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> says the only time he thought about <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> was when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would sleep in <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s bed at the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and his wife won. `` And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I could n't sleep,'' he said. `` The bed was like a banana. The springs were shot.''

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks have boosted the prime lending rate back into the double digits for the first time in three years, reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s drive to push all interest rates higher to stave off inflation. Thursday's half-percentage point hike in the prime, to 10 percent, pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the spring of 1985. The increase is likely to pinch the pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise in recent months.

 Businesses and consumers with bank loans priced according to swings in the prime interest rate will feel the most immediate impact from major banks' decisions to boost the rate for the third time this year. The banks raised their base lending rates by a half-percentage point to 10 percent on Thursday _ a more than 3-year high _ in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s drive to push all interest rates higher to curb inflation. The prime rate increase, the second in a month, puts the key lending rate in double-digit territory for the first time since June 1985. Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-and adjustable-rate loans, the change will affect consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise in recent months. A higher prime rate will affect small - to medium-sized businesses and consumers more so than large corporations, which borrow more cheaply in the open market by issuing commercial paper, or short-term unsecured IOUs Home equity lines of credit usually are pegged to the prime rate, while many adjustable-rate home mortgages are tied to interest paid on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said higher borrowing costs may have a significant effect on the spending habits of consumers, who have been buying on credit in increasing numbers lately. `` If you have to pay more -LRB- for loans -RRB- then you have less money to buy things like furniture, clothing ... and other little niceties,'' she said. `` It will slow the economy, but it wo n't stop it in its tracks,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` That's a healthy thing right now. `` You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That's preventative medicine That's what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is doing,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. Financial markets took Thursday's news in stride after weathering the storm that followed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in a key lending rate earlier in the week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed up 5.16 to 2,039.30. Bond prices, which generally decline in the face of rising interest rates, ended mixed. The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies, although some European traders credited the prime rate hike for preventing a free fall. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was the first to announce the prime hike Thursday morning, with other major banks across the country quickly following suit. The increase brings the prime to its highest level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from 10 percent. The prime was at 8.5 percent at the beginning of the year. The banks raised it to 9 percent on May 11 and then to 9.5 percent on July 14. Economists widely had anticipated the latest boost the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> signaled its desire to tighten credit on Tuesday by raising its discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, citing inflationary pressures. The discount rate is the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to member banks. Economists said the subsequent boost in the prime reflected the rising of borrowing costs faced by the banks. Rates banks pay on products such as certificates of deposits or money market accounts have been forced up, although not at the same pace as bank loans. The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be overheating and inflation creeping up. Higher inflation erodes the value of fixed-rate investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, forcing borrowers to pay higher interest rates to attract investors. Many analysts predict interest rate will continue to head higher but discount a big increase.

<HEAD>Bally Restructuring Continues With Plans to Spin Off Hotel-Casino

 <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which last month disclosed the sale of its pinball-machine and video-game businesses, is taking an even bigger restructuring step by spinning off its hotel-casino group to its shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> announced the planned restructuring late Thursday and said it planned to maintain a 15 percent stake in the hotel-casino business, which accounted for about half its $ 1.73 billion in sales last year. The move is intended to boost <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price by creating two separate companies and `` by permitting the separate management of each company to pursue specific business opportunities on an independent basis,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed up 12 -LCB- cents at $ 22.75 Thursday in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The restructuring was announced after the market closed. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders will receive as a tax-free dividend one share of common stock in the hotel-casino business for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> they own on the effective date of the spin-off. The company, the creator of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and other video-game hits, announced last month it was selling its pinball-video manufacturing business on which the company was founded for about $ 8 million to rival <ORGANIZATION> WMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> will retain all of its other leisure and manufacturing businesses, which consist of <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Tennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a chain of 250 fitness centers; the Aladdin's Castle chain of more than 300 video arcades; the Scientific Games division, which manufactures lottery equipment; <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of exercise equipment; and a slot-machine manufacturing division. The arrangement should allow the stock price of each publicly-traded company to more accurately reflect <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s underlying value, the company said in a statement <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s health and fitness operations and the gaming equipment divisions accounted for roughly 43 percent of the company's revenue last year. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> indicated it expected each of the separate companies to post more than $ 1 billion in revenue this year. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Isgur </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the company had been expected for some time to pursue some type of restructuring. `` You could have the value of the two asset groups appreciate significantly from where they are today,'' <PERSON> Isgur </PERSON> said. `` Diverse groups of investors can focus on the group that most attracts them.'' <PERSON> Isgur </PERSON> said he began recommending <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s stock last spring, when it was trading around $ 16. Wall Street has regarded <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> as ripe for a restructuring due to a relatively weak stock price stemming from an erratic performance in several ventures, such as its video game business. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> made big profits from the business during the video game craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but earnings tumbled when the games' popularity declined. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> wrote off much of the video game business in 1984 after it lost more than $ 100 million. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> fended off a takeover overture from real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in 1987, paying a premium to buy <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s 9.9 percent stake in the company. The hotel-casino company will operate two <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino hotels, <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s Park Place and <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s Grand; and two casino hotels in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. Consumation of the spin-off will require approval from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>, which also plans to seek stockholder approval.

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s patent court victory over rival <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was upheld by a federal judge, who ruled that another judge in the case was unbiased despite a relative's <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock holdings. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> on Thursday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s request to throw out a 1985 decision by another federal judge who found <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had violated several Polaroid patents on instant film and cameras. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> immediately appealed the decision to the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON>'s ruling came during the first hearing to set a schedule for the damages portion of the case. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has requested $ 5.7 billion in damages for the patent infringements. The damages trial tentatively is set to begin in January. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had argued in the 12-year-old patent case that all of federal Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s rulings in the case should be vacated because <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s mother-in-law owned 1,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock worth about $ 100,000 when the trial began in 1981. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> withdrew from the case in June shortly after her mother-in-law died and she was named as a beneficiary of the stock, which had increased to 2,150 shares because of stock splits. `` Under the circumstances, I can not find that it is the law that <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> obtain a vacation of this case up to this point,'' <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said. `` I do not think that would be fair or be equitable to everyone.'' <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> made it clear at the outset of the trial in October 1981 that her mother-in-law owned the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock. He said neither <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> raised the issue during the initial trial, after <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s ruling in 1985 or during a lengthy appeal process. `` She said she did not think that was a disqualifying reason,'' <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think that was incorrect. <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodak </PERSON> did not disagree with it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> called the decision `` entirely proper and correct and obviously sound.'' Polaroid, the Cambridge-based camera company that pioneered instant photography, sued <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 after the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, camera company introduced its own line of instant film and cameras. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> ruled in September 1985 that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had infringed on seven of about 150 Polaroid patents, and barred <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> from the business in January 1986. On May 9, she told both sides that she intended to remove herself from the case because she and her husband were beneficiaries of her mother-in-law's estate. The judge acquiesced after both sides encouraged her to continue in the case and asked her for time to research the situation. But in a motion filed June 15, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> called for <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s immediate disqualification and dismissal of all her rulings in the case since October 1981 One week later, she withdrew.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell today in early European trading hampered by a European-wide outage of a computerized trading system. Gold prices rose slightly. Foreign currency dealers said trading patterns were motivated by profit-taking ahead of a holiday weekend in several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries. Selling pressure was increased by the computer outage, they said. `` People are afraid they wo n't be able to get out of their positions since trading goes only by phone and half our phone lines here are already out of order,'' said one dealer at a major bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Dealers also said they were waiting for American trade figures for June to be released on Tuesday. Analysts expect the trade deficit to range between $ 11.5 billion and $ 12.5 billion, compared with May's $ 11 billion deficit. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar finished the week at 133.05 yen, down 1.02 yen from Thursday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 132.90 yen.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A financial planner may have fled with as much as $ 25 million in retirement funds belonging to a group of doctors and other investors, each of whom received an apologetic note explaining, `` I have run away.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>, 51, a former self-made millionaire whose career as an ace salesman collapsed in personal bankruptcy, is believed to have fled the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, and sources close to the case say he may have left the country. About 50 of <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>'s clients learned of his disappearance when they received copies of the handwritten note in the mail this week. `` Everybody is pretty much in a state of shock,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Filhaber </PERSON>, a 61-year-old salesman who says he had total trust in <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> for 12 years. `` We're all sort of walking around bouncing off walls. `` My wife and I have worked 17 bloody years, morning, noon and night, and now we're broke,'' <PERSON> Filhaber </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Now I can understand why old people believe in mattresses.'' In his note, <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> said he was `` unable to face the humiliation, disgrace and consequences'' that would follow once his company, <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, collapsed. He added that he would try to return the doctors' money. `` I have been dealing with financial and emotional problems for the past many months and have been unable to come up with any solution other than running,'' the note said. `` By the time you receive this letter, I will be gone. ... I have run away.'' <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> and his companies were being investigated for possible wire fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement and interstate transportation of stolen property, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> handled pension funds for a long list of clients that included at least 20 doctors, many of whom are wondering whether they'll see their money again. `` I'm very angry,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> pathologist. `` But I do n't want to talk about it. I might say something I should n't.'' A court statement filed Wednesday by 12 clients who are suing <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> to recover the funds says the financial adviser fled town Monday, leaving behind his wife and two grown children. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> worked for some of the doctors for as long as 20 years, even managing their offices. A <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> circuit judge on Wednesday granted the clients' request to appoint a receiver to oversee the finances of <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>, his family and his companies. The investors also filed a $ 25 million lawsuit accusing <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> of fraudulently shifting their money to his wife and two children, according to their attorney, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Solowsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>'s wife said through an attorney that she had `` no prior knowledge of his intentions to leave.'' <PERSON> Solowsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> accepted money from clients to invest in certificates of deposit, but banks said they had no record of any CDs being purchased. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> also accepted money to buy medical malpractice insurance for his physician clients but failed to pay any premiums, <PERSON> Solowsky </PERSON> said. `` It's difficult to determine how much is missing,'' the lawyer said. From polling various clients, <PERSON> Solowsky </PERSON> said he believes the figure is as high as $ 25 million. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> is neither a lawyer nor an accountant, and his investment and management companies are not registered with the state as investment advisers, <PERSON> Solowsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>, son of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> waiter, became a millionaire before he turned 30 through his financial acumen and salesmanship. He sold $ 1 million worth of insurance in one year for the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. His financial troubles began in July 1969 <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>, then 34, filed for personal bankruptcy, listing $ 1 million in unpaid bills for casinos, hotels, credit card purchases, clothes and flowers.

<HEAD>Six Plead Innocent In Wall Street Racketeering Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five top officers of an investment group pleaded innocent to racketeering charges alleging a scheme to sell bogus stock and securities, and their lawyers criticized what they called a `` broad attack on Wall Street.'' A sixth defendant, a former trader for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, did not attend the arraignment Thursday at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, but his lawyer entered an innocent plea for him. The six were named last week in a 35-count indictment on charges of racketeering and conspiracy, the first time racketeering charges have been leveled against individual securities traders. In court Thursday, prosecutors disclosed that they plan to bring a new and broader indictment in the case within two months. The indictment could add additional charges or new defendants. The defendants from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a limited partnership based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Pennington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, 41, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, 41, all of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smotrich </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a former securities trader at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, entered an innocent plea through his lawyer. Defense lawyers criticized the government's plan, saying it would preclude a speedy trial because the lawyers would need more time to prepare for any additional charges. The lawyers issued a three-page statement, which said in part that the racketeering charges were brought `` to coerce the testimony of the defendants against principals'' at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, firms the partners had dealt with. Two grand juries are investigating allegations of insider trading involving the firms or their principals. The statement said the partnership `` is proud of its association with those firms, has no evidence of any wrongdoing on their part, and refuses to join in this broad attack on Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> responded that the defense statement `` has no merit.'' He said federal prosecutors have used the racketeering statutes in other securities cases and that defense lawyers in other cases have always complained about it. The indictment accuses the six of a multimillion-dollar mail and wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades in order to create phony long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for Princeton-Newport. The indictment charged there was also a scheme involving the bogus sale of securities between Princeton-Newport Partners and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to create more than $ 13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatory disclosure requirements. If convicted on all counts, each of the defendants faces a maximum 20-year sentence.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Proposed Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it's disappointed that a judge rejected a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit alleging that some of its cars were defective, and it may go to trial with the case. Cook County Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> on Thursday threw out the proposed settlement between the company and a group of car owners who alleged that their <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 sedans suddenly accelerated without warning. The settlement `` puts people in a position where they have to buy an <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> to reap any benefit,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. `` Clearly, it's a settlement that I could n't live with.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> vacated an earlier order by another judge who gave preliminary approval to the settlement. The judge recommended that both sides try to negotiate another agreement and report any progress at a hearing Aug. 31. `` We are not sure that we will be negotiating,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` We always have the option of defending the suit.'' But he said that the automaker had not decided what option to pursue. Attorneys for both sides announced the proposed settlement in June, under which <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> would have offered rebates of $ 300 to $ 2,000 to 390,000 current or former owners who bought another <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. However, the company would not acknowledge liability. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> gave prelimary approval to the settlement, but removed himself in July because of his friendship with an attorney in the case. Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON>, who represents the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> owners who contend their cars had sudden acceleration problems, subsequently submitted a motion to vacate <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>'s ruling. He contended the judge had failed to give `` proper scrutiny'' to the matter before approving it. `` I certainly have a lot of respect for Judge <PERSON> Rakowksi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON> said after the judge's ruling Thursday. `` He was obviously very troubled by what went on so far,'' he said. The case stems from a 1987 class-action suit alleging the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s were defective because they could accelerate without warning. The settlement would have applied to owners of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s built between 1978 and 1986. The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based group formed by consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, has contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> acceleration problem was linked to at least 1,650 accidents, causing 402 injuries and five deaths.

<HEAD>Record Broken For Bank Failures In Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The record for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank failures in a year has been shattered a little over halfway through 1988, the legacy of a dramatic slump in oil prices and its reverberations throughout the state's economy. Federal regulators declared three more <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks insolvent Thursday, and their decision to count all 40 of First RepublicBank's former subsidiary banks as failed institutions produced a one-day total of 43 that raised the year's count to 86. The list of failed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks soared far beyond last year's total of 50 bank failures, the previous state record Of the total of 141 banks nationwide listed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as having failed so far this year, more than 60 percent have been in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Four <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks have required federal bailouts this year. The three banks declared insolvent Thursday were <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Balch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Galena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> will be merged with other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks, while <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> will not reopen but its depositors will have access to their money at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> was named receiver for liquidation in all three cases. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank failures, like the nationwide figure, hit post-Depression levels in 1986 and have increased since as the state continues to feel the effects of the dramatic drop in oil prices and its resulting effects on real estate and the overall economy. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> led the nation in bank failures the past two years, with 26 declared insolvent in 1986 and the 50 closed in 1987. Regulators frequently cite liberal lending practices and huge loan losses as reasons for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank failures and also blame banking officials for poor management. Before the 1985 oil price free-fall, a risky loan could be made and a bank could expect repayment from collateral if the loan failed. But with the depreciation of real estate because of the drop in energy prices, many loans can not be repayed, requiring banks to set aside more revenue to make up for the unpaid loans. Thursday's announcement could further provoke <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> investors who have threatened legal action over the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s move. Many of the 40 subsidiary banks were healthy but were declared insolvent by the government when <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> _ then the state's largest bank holding company _ failed and was purchased last month by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, under an FDIC-sponsored bailout.

 Share prices were higher at midday Friday, as players cautiously stepped in to pick up some bargains after sharp declines earlier in the week. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 8.3 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,843.5 at about 12:15 p.m. The index moved up as much as 10.9 points in late morning. Volume was moderate at 244.3 million shares at midday compared with 270.3 million shares at the same time Thursday. While gains were widespread, institutional buying focused on selected shares. In particular, buying was seen in those stocks that had suffered the most from the week's declines, triggered by interest rate rises in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> earlier in the week. Fund managers, still sitting on large cash reserves, appeared unwilling to miss out should equities begin to rally in coming weeks.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist said today that despite `` a massive loss'' in farm production because of the drought, there is no danger of food shortages or runaway inflation at grocery stores this year. `` We did come into this season with good stock levels,'' Assistant Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program. `` So there is no prospect of any shortages this year and we do n't think there will be big price increases because we came in with pretty good supplies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> issued a report Thursday saying the drought should add only 1 percentage point to consumer food prices. `` We do n't see any runaway price inflation at the retail level,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in the interview. The relatively optimistic price report came despite drought damage that is expected to include a 37 percent drop in corn production and continued threats to the soybean crop. `` These figures show a massive loss in production. It's almost unprecedented what we're seeing this year. We had a very, very dry period in June,'' he said. `` We're now moving into a critical phase for the soybeans and if we do n't get rain in August we'll lose even more of the soybean crop. The department now is forecasting a food price increase for this year of 3 percent to 5 percent. Before the heat and dry weather, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. But the impact might be even bigger in 1989, when food costs could go up an additional 2 percent due to the drought, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. `` That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` So this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.'' According to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop production report issued Thursday, the corn harvest this fall may be about 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year's harvest and the smallest output since 1983. Sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans, wheat and a number of other crops. Cotton, which thrived last month in the hot, humid weather, is expected to increase from last year. The grim news from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> came only hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a $ 3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought-stricken farmers. `` This bill is n't as good as rain,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said to the nation's farmers `` But it will tide you over until normal weather and your own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role.'' Overall, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> put total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average, a scale used to compare output from year to year. Tha matched the low 1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreage programs, along with drought, reduced production sharply. The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvested acre, down from 119.4 bushels per acre last year, a record year-to-year decline of 34 percent. Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. `` Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year's crops,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told reporters. `` But because of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases to assure an adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign customers and meet our food-aid commitments.'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement, `` Today's crop report confirms our fears about the impacts of this summer's tragic drought Fortunately, it appears we will have enough stocks to make it through this marketing year.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop estimates were based on field surveys as of Aug. 1. In May and June, before drought had made its biggest impact, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels. But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2 billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the season. The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year. Prospects last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July projection was 1.65 billion bushels. Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels, down 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987. Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last year. But durum and the other spring varieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains, showed sharp declines. Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent from last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212 million bushels, down 53 percent from 1987. Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1 percent from last year. The crop was projected at 13.7 billion bales in July. Production of some other spring-planted crops also has suffered, including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288 million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million bushels, down 24 percent. Earlier, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised Democratic and Republican congressional leaders for putting aside partisan differences to speed action on the disaster relief bill. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the legislation, which also provides assistance to dairy cattlemen and ethanol producers, `` represents the largest disaster relief measure in history.'' The measure, among other things, provides aid for farmers suffering crop losses of more than 35 percent of their expected harvest because of the drought or other calamities. The payments would be equal to 65 percent of the lost income. Farmers whose crop losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected yield would receive payments equal to 90 percent of lost income. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said farmers intending to apply for relief under the drought bill should organize all their records and other evidence of their crop losses. The department said, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would not be ready to start accepting applications for several weeks. Once the preliminary rule-making for the program is completed, farmers will apply to their <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> county agent for both the disaster payments and livestock feed assistance. Farmers seeking government loans also available under the program should contact their local <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> offices, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Billions of Underground Rubles, Thousands of Millionaires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A shadow economy that supplies everything the official system ca n't, from bathroom repairs to medicine, earns up to $ 145 billion a year and has made thousands of millionaires, a report said today. Economist T.I. <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON> told the labor newspaper Trud the underground economy will continue to grow until rubles earned by average people become more than `` paper that gives you the right to stand in line and be humiliated.'' Many Soviets gladly pay more on the side for scarce goods or to have a repairman do better, faster work. They also give doctors a gift or cash to be more attentive. Extra money, in turn, gives those who earn it a chance to buy goods and services above state-set prices. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves to legalize cooperatives and some individual labor have brought some people out of the shadows and into the official economy where they pay taxes. But many more remain outside, corrupting the official system, the article said. Services provided on the side, or `` na levo,'' in Russian, account for about $ 22 billion to $ 24 billion a year, or about one-quarter of the entire amount Soviets pay annually, it said. The article said that 15 or 20 years ago, the value of underground services was about $ 4.8 billion to $ 8 billion. Today, together with the underground trade in food and other goods, it ranges from $ 110 billion to $ 145 billion. By comparison, the entire Soviet state budget for this fiscal year is about $ 760 billion. The main items are overpaying workers for better housing and car repair, tailoring, and better attention at weddings and funerals, it said. The shadow economy is well known, but figures are rarely given for its size. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness on selected topics, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media have been more critical of social problems. Ms. <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON> disagreed with some Soviets who see the underground economy as merely instituting one of the main aims of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, paying more to people who work better `` Underground businessmen pull into their affairs the bureaucracy and the apparatus, which increases the growth of corruption _ in order to live in the existing system it's necessary to bribe people who do n't do anything themselves but who have the final ` yes,' or ` no,''' she was quoted as saying. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a few hundred legal millionaires, mostly writers and artists, but probably thousands more in the shadow economy, the article said. `` There are among them people who do n't have a ruble in cash. Their money is constantly turning over in order to bring them an income,'' she reported. The underground economy will continue to exist until the official economy can provide the goods and services people want, the article said. That means the economy must in the future be managed by the laws of the market rather than bureaucrats, it said. `` That means we need directives that would return land to farmers, and factories to the workers _ to make the people the all-powerful masters of the country,'' Ms. <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON> concluded.

<HEAD>Report Shows Inflation On The Rise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with six grafs to UPDATE with report on wholesale
prices; will be led with Commerce Department report on business
inventories and sales during June, due at 10 a.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Inflation at the wholesale level rose to an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, reflecting big boosts in a wide variety of products, including clothng, automobiles, furniture and poultry, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent last month, the biggest gain since March. Price increases were widespread across a wide variety of non-food items, such as drugs, which were up 1.1 percent and cosmetics, up 1.7 percent. In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finised goods rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more than double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for all of 1987. Today's report comes just three days after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> initiated an increase in interest rates to fight inflation. On Thursday, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks reacted quickly to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move by boosting the prime lending rate a half percentage point to 10 percent, the highest level since the spring of 1985. The prime rate hike, though, did n't upset the financial markets because it was a widely expected response to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier action, in which the central bank raised the discount rate half a percentage point to 6.5 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.16 Thursday to 2,039.30. The average had had fallen nearly 100 points over the five previous sessions, partly because of interest-rate jitters. The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies, indicating that the boost in the prime rate was not seen as a powerful lure for foreign money. The dollar's weakness in turn hurt bond prices, which finished mostly unchanged or lower. Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-and adjustable-rate loans, the increase is likely to pinch the pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise in recent months. `` It will slow the economy, but it wo n't stop it in its tracks,'' explained <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` That's a healthy thing right now. `` You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That's preventative medicine That's what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is doing.'' The increase brings the closely watched rate to its highest level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from 10 percent. At the start of the year, the prime stood at 8.5 percent. It was raised to 9 percent on May 11 and then another half percentage point on July 14. The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be overheating and inflation creeping up. In indicator of economic activity, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July. But economists warned that rising interest rates threaten to dampen even this modest growth rate in the months ahead.

 The president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> ALC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance telephone company, has resigned after the company reported a $ 6.6 million loss in the second quarter. <PERSON> Geore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasilakos </PERSON>, who resigned Thursday, will be replaced by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CTI </ORGANIZATION> director who was named <ORGANIZATION> ALC </ORGANIZATION> board chairman last week, <ORGANIZATION> ALC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` With the recent change in control at the company, he wanted to give the new board the opportunity to make some immediate changes,'' the company said in announcing <PERSON> Vasilakos </PERSON>' resignation Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> ALC </ORGANIZATION> had a net loss of $ 6.6 million on net revenue of $ 99.9 million for the quarter ending June 30, compared with a net profit of $ 1.1 million on revenue of $ 99.9 million in the second quarter of 1987. The company had a loss of $ 9.8 million on revenue of $ 201.6 million for the first six months of the year, compared with a profit of $ 3.8 million on revenue of $ 205 million in the first half of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> ALC </ORGANIZATION> said its long-distance traffic was up 17 percent in the first six months of the year compared with a year earlier, but the losses resulted from price cuts totaling 18 percent in the highly competitive long-distance business. The company has had money problems since Allnet merged with <PERSON> Lexitel </PERSON> in 1986 to form the nation's fourth-largest long-distance network.

 Stock prices lost more ground today as rising interest rates kept the pressure on the market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 7.83 to 2,031.47 in the first half hour of trading.

 Two stockholders of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will have to go to civil court to try to block <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> from getting more than $ 60 million from his deal to sell the company, following the rejection of their claims by the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The panel said Thursday that the stockholders should take their objections to a civil court. <PERSON> Julien </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studley </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutstein </PERSON> had argued that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is not entitled to any payment for severing his services agreement. In May, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> reached an agreement to sell his interest in Resorts to entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> in a deal which will take the company private and give <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> the unfinished Taj Mahal casino hotel. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has agreed to buy <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s controlling Class B stock in the company for $ 96.2 million and to pay Trump approximately $ 63 million to sever a services agreement. The services agreement was based on revenues, pre-tax income and the construction cost of the Taj Mahal. In return, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed to buy the Taj Mahal for approximately $ 255 million. The stockholders argued that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is not entitled to any payment for severing his services agreement with Resorts, and the agreement is void. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandler </PERSON>, a lawyer for the stockholders, has said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought control of the company a year ago and is now making a $ 63 million profit from the termination of the management agreement, as well as getting the <ORGANIZATION> Taj </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mahal </ORGANIZATION> at a lucrative price. In the interim, <PERSON> Bandler </PERSON> has charged, the stockholders have lost $ 135 million and he cited the decline in market value of Resorts Class A stock.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said delays in scheduled European flights in June were at least three times as many as in June 1986. <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumeister </PERSON> said Friday that while delays in scheduled flights are not yet as bad as for charter flights, `` the situation is definitely getting worse.'' In January, 11.5 percent of scheduled flights in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were more than 15 minutes late and by late June, this had reached 22 percent, <PERSON> Neumeister </PERSON> said in a statement. `` In June 1988, the delays caused by congestion problems were more than three times as many as in June 1986,'' he said. In reality, he said, the picture is even worse since AEA on-time figures do not include `` reactionary delays'' where inbound flights, late due to insufficient air traffic control capacity, delay outgoing flights. Normally, flight punctuality drops during the winter months because of weather conditions and rises in the summer. `` In 1988, the trend was reversed,'' <PERSON> Neumeister </PERSON> said. He blamed this uncharacteristic drop on insufficient air traffic control capacity. In recent months, thousands of European vacationers have spent long hours at airports as their south-bound charters were delayed by strikes by air traffic controllers in several countries.

 Corn, oat and soybean futures soared their permitted limits at today's opening on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment of the drought's toll on crop production. In a report issued after the markets closed on Thursday, The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> predicted this year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn production would fall 37 percent below last year's harvest, soybean production would decline by 23 percent and wheat production would drop by 14 percent. Analysts said the government's soybean production estimate of 1.47 billion bushels _ the smallest harvest since 1976 _ was the biggest surprise. `` The market must work higher to seek a price that will discourage usage or we're simply going to run out of soybeans, and the market wo n't let that happen,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, director of commodties research for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based commodity brokerage house. Corn and oat futures are limited to daily moves of 10 cents a bushel and soybeans to 30 cents a bushel. The exchange has removed the limits on the soybean contract for August delivery, which leaped more than 50 cents a bushel at the opening. In early trading, wheat was 9 -LCB- cents to 10 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.92 a bushel; corn was 5 -RCB- cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 3.06 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher across the board with September at $ 2.84 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 30 cents to 59 cents higher with August at $ 9.15 a bushel. Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .58 cent higher with August at 68.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent to .60 cent lower with August at 80.30 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to 1 cent higher with August at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .68 cent to 1.93 cent higher with August at 36.40 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled lower on Thursday while pork futures were higher.

 Wholesale price inflation increased to an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, spurred by big boosts over a wide variety of products, including clothing, automobiles, furniture and poultry, the government said today. The increase came despite lower prices for beef, as the drought prompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burned-out pastures and higher feed prices. Just three days after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> initiated an increase in interest rates to fight inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in July, the same monthly increases as in May and March. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We would rather not see any increase in producer prices, but we still believe inflation remains low and under control.'' In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finished goods rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more than double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for all of 1987. Wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pace in July _ 0.4 percent _ than for goods overall, indicating to some analysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguing the farm belt were over. Food prices had been rising faster than prices for other products on the wholesale level since April. Overall energy prices, meanwhile, remained unchanged after a 1.6 percent drop in June, with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increase in gasoline prices offsetting a 6.1 percent decline in what distributors pay for home heating oil. Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices rose at 0.6 percent in July. Because food and energy prices are highly volatile from month to month, most analysts look to price changes for other products as a better indication of underlying inflation. Analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what they called an over-reaction in June to the drought. `` As expected, higher feed prices and burned-out pastures have sharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meat prices,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, director of economic forecasting at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said, fruit trees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing off their fruit early `` resulting in a temporary early supply of fruit.'' Wholesale prices in July fell 2.5 percent for beef, 10.5 percent for pork and 0.2 percent for soft drinks. They rose 2.3 percent for fruit, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in June, 7.5 percent for vegetables, 13.3 percent for bakery products, 2 percent for chickens and 20.3 percent for processed turkeys. <PERSON> Rataczak </PERSON> predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 as a result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiral upwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then. Price increases were widespread across a wide variety of non-food items. Men's clothing rose 0.9 percent, drugs were up 1.1 percent, cosmetics increased 1.7 percent and auto prices edged up 0.5 percent after a 1 percent decrease in June. The only non-food, non-energy consumer items for which wholesale prices fell last month were glassware, down 2.3 percent, and household flatware, down 0.4 percent. The July increase in finished goods overall put the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index at 108.5. That means a variety of goods costing $ 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost $ 108.50 last month, compared with $ 107.90 in June and $ 106.00 a year ago. Wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose 0.7 percent in July, indicating more inflation lies ahead despite the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Tuesday to boost the rate it charges banks for credit from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. Prices for intermediate goods, or those used in processing, had risen 0.9 percent in June. Analysts said the smaller July increase was due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before before <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed late in the monthy to a cease-fire. Excluding food and energy, prices for intermediate goods such as industrial chemicals, finished steel products, paper and synthetic fibers rose 0.7 percent overall. However, raw material prices fell 1.1 percent, with crude oil prices plummeting 9.3 percent. Corn prices soared 20 percent on the drought, but the increase was smaller than in June. Raw iron and steel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady for three months. Price changes on the retail level usually lag one to three months behind those at wholesale. Consumer price inflation has been averaging 4.4 percent for the past 18 months. July figures on consumer prices are to be published Aug. 23.

<HEAD>California Considers Deregulating Some Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s retail stores would be able to charge unlimited interest rates on their credit-card accounts under legislation being considered by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. The proposal, supported by the retailers but opposed by consumer groups, would repeal during a three-year period the current 18 percent interest ceiling that was established 28 years ago. Bank credit cards would not be affected. Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dills </PERSON>, who introduced the bill, said current limit prevents stores from offering credit to poorer consumers. The no-limit interest policy would `` open up some credit opportunities that do n't exist at this time,'' added Democratic Assemblyman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>. But critics charge the proposal would result in $ 450 million in additional interest charges over three years. <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, a Democrat, described the measure as `` clearly the worst consumer bill of the year.'' He said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers pay an extra $ 50 million in interest rates for each percentage point added to interest rates by stores. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, in 1982, 1984 and 1986, approved temporary increases in the interest limit to 19.2 percent. However, last year the governor vetoed another increase, noting that the prime lending rate had fallen from over 20 percent in 1980 to between 8 percent and 9 percent in 1987, and `` the record is devoid of evidence supporting the need for the higher ceiling.'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who rarely discusses pending legislation, has declined to discuss his position on the bill. He has until the end of this month to decide its fate. The Assembly approved the bill in a 49-22 vote Monday; the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it in June. The bill would take effect Jan. 1, 1989 and expire three years later, at which time the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> could decide to extend or kill it based on a review by a non-partisan state legislative analyst. Assemblyman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a Republican who was a key backer of the bill, said that if stores are limited to 18 percent they can offer credit only to customers considered lower risks or raise their prices to compensate for the loss. The current ceiling `` is hurting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers as well as the retail industry,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. Deregulation would `` let the marketplace set the rates.'' Democratic Assemblyman <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Aerias </PERSON>, a critic of the bill, said that a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> study found that stores actually did not offer poor people more credit after deregulation. `` This is a reverse <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> where we're robbing from the poor,'' he said. According to an Assembly finance committee, 16 other states have deregulated retail credit.

 A severe shortage of computer memory chips is slowly beginning to ease, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics makers remain deeply concerned about their vulnerability to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s control of the critical components. Memory chips are the plywood of the worldwide electronics industry _ essential to products ranging from personal computers to copying machines. The supply crunch has left <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics makers wringing their hands over lost sales, foregone profits, delayed product introductions and worsened relations with customers. Although Japanese companies such as <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> account for 80 to 90 percent of worldwide sales of memory chips, few people are accusing those companies of delibrately engineering the shortages. In fact, there is a shortage of memory chips inside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which has surpassed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to become the world's largest consumer of chips. `` Some major, major major corporations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ca n't find product. They're coming to us,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurewitz </PERSON>, an owner of <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R Enterprises in <LOCATION> Canoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which deals in used and surplus chips. Nevertheless, the vulnerability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to Japanese suppliers has been highlighted by the chip squeeze. The dominance in memory chips gives the Japanese a base to solidify control of the products that use the chips. `` The Japanese have a large stake in supplanting -LRB- U.S.-based -RRB- merchant producers as the providers of leading-edge chip technologies,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrus </PERSON>, deputy director of the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roundtable </LOCATION> on the International Economy. If the Japanese companies succeed in gaining unquestioned leadership in chip technology, they will be able to reserve the latest chips for their own computers, phone switches, satellites and other equipment before making them available to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European rivals, <PERSON> Borrus </PERSON> said. `` At stake for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is not simply the $ 25 billion market for semiconductors, but the current $ 0.5 trillion market for the final products that incorporate semiconductors, soon to be a $ 1 trillion market,'' <PERSON> Borrus </PERSON> writes in a new book, `` Competing for Control: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Stake in Microelectronics.'' So far the threat from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is more theoretical than real. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest producer of 1-megabit DRAMs -LRB- pronounced dee-rams -RRB-, allocates more than 60 percent of its output of the chips to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers even though its own personal computer unit in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is short on them. But the potential for manipulation is starkly obvious, especially considering that DRAMs can account for up to a quarter of the cost of building a computer. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is one company that has felt the sting of the chip shortage. The booming <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> maker of computer workstations, which just cracked the $ 1 billion barrier in annual sales, says its revenue would have been $ 100 million higher if chip shortages had not delayed deliveries. Sun occupies a market that Japanese competitors have scarcely touched, yet is heavily dependent on chips from companies that are potential rivals. A similar dilemma faces another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer industry star, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which relies on Japanese-made chips at the same time it fends off Japanese challenges to its role as the world's leading maker of supercomputers <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> has never taken a position on whether a strong, U.S.-based semiconductor industry is needed. Ironically, for all the problems of a chip shortage, the greatest long-term danger to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry could come from an eventual chip glut. The last glut drove several of the biggest U.S.-based DRAM suppliers out of the business because they could not afford the huge losses, and the next one could wreak similar havoc. Japanese companies are better able to sustain losses on chips because they make other products that tide them over. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is in a similar position. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest DRAM producer, but sells none to outsiders. The only two U.S.-based companies that still sell DRAMs on the open market are <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which have earned windfall profits that will enable them to keep current on the technology. For now, a bust in memory chip prices is still a distant threat. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement prepared for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we are afraid that the current unusual supply-demand relations will not ease until the middle of 1989.'' Shortages of the older 256-kilobit DRAMs could prevail even longer because production lines for them have been retooled for the new chips. There are also growing shortages of 1-megabit static random access memories, or SRAMs. Average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spot prices have fallen to $ 37 apiece in July from $ 47.50 in April for the most advanced memory chips in mass production, the 1 million-bit dynamic random access memories known as 1-megabit DRAMs. That is still way above the $ 19.50 spot price that prevailed in July 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the market research firm. In April, some desperate customers paid as much as $ 65 apiece for small quantities of 1-megabit DRAMs, according to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Giudice </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION>. It became common for companies to pillage memory chips from older computers and other equipment. The supply squeeze in memory chips seems to have two main sources, the main one being the sticky transition to the new, hard-to-build megabit chips from the older 256-kilobit variety. Producing the new chips demands unprecedented precision and cleanliness, and it has taken chipmakers longer than expected to gear up production. At the same time, a boom in sales of personal computers and other gear has increased the demand for the chips. A secondary reason for the squeeze is the 1986 accord between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to prevent `` dumping'' of Japanese-made chips at unfairly low prices. In order to prop up prices to comply with the accord, the Japanese government instructed its chip makers to hold back on production. That anti-dumping accord was supposed to lure more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies back into producing DRAMs by guaranteeing them some protection when chip prices begin skidding, an inevitable process given the improving yields from existing fabrication lines and the start-up of new ones. So far, though, few companies have been lured back. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is starting up DRAM production again. But <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in spite of the accord, dropped out of the DRAM business last year. The reluctance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to enter or stay in the market is understandable considering the roughly $ 300 million it takes to build a state-of-the-art fabrication plant and the boom-bust nature of chip prices. In the long run, many analysts say, sustaining a healthy chip industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will probably depend on more government initiatives such as the anti-dumping accord and _ importantly _ closer cooperation between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chipmakers and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip users. `` We're both realizing that adversarial is n't the best way to go,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

 Car owners involved in a lawsuit alleging some of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cars are defective are forming a `` barricuda network'' to attack the company after a judge threw out a tentative settlement, a company official contended Friday. Cook County Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> on Thursday threw out the proposed settlement between the company and a class of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> car owners who alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 sedans suddenly accelerate without warning. `` I sense a barricuda network setting up where everybody wants to get a piece of the meat and to get into the deep pockets of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which Troy, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> contended Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> car owners based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was advising some of its members to withdraw from the class-action lawsuit and file individual lawsuits against the company. Such a move could cost the company thousands of dollars in legal fees, he said. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said only 1,500 of the 340,000 owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> sedans covered by the proposed settlement of the class-action lawsuit refused to agree to it. He blamed the settlement's rejection on the victims network `` The <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> has not been a headache to us, it's been a major disease to <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON>, an attorney for the victims network, said he had advised his clients to withdraw from the class-action suit because, under terms of the proposed settlement, owners would have had to buy another <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. The group of about 800 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> owners contend their cars suddenly accelerate without warning, <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON> said. `` Some people have put their cars away and refuse to drive or sell them,'' he said. `` Why would they want to buy another one? `` I would say if we were barricudas, there must be sharks circling in the waters as well,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> officials trying to eliminate complaints from car owners. The case stems from a 1987 class-action lawsuit alleging that <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s were defective because of sudden acceleration problems. The settlement would have applied to owners of <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s built between 1978 and 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> officials maintain that owners have been unable to prove their <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 sedans have any defects and say the settlement rejected by <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> is fair. Under terms of the settlement, proposed in June by attorneys for both sides, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> car owners who bought another <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> would have been offered rebates of up to $ 2,000, but would have had to free the company from all liability. The judge recommended Thursday that both sides try to negotiate a new settlement and report any progress at a hearing scheduled for Aug. 31. `` After the ruling, we have to look at all our options,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` One option is to renegotiate; the other is to litigate.'' <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON> said the victims network may ask the judge to let them become a third party in the case. `` There's no question that we're going to be watching to see what happens next,'' <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON> said a day after <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> approved his motion to throw out a previous judge's ruling giving preliminary approval to the settlement. <PERSON> Nassau </PERSON>'s motion called for vacating Circuit Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>'s earlier ruling, contending the judge had not given `` proper scrutiny'' to the matter before approving it. After giving the proposed settlement the preliminary go-ahead, <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> removed himself from the case in July, saying he had a potential conflict of interest because he was friends with an attorney in the case. Thursday's ruling was a victory for the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based group formed by consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>. The center contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> acceleration problem was linked to at least 1,650 accidents, causing 402 injuries and five deaths.

<HEAD>Shareholders Suing To Block Management Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least five groups of <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have filed suit against the company, seeking to thwart a $ 950 million management-led leveraged buyout they consider `` grossly unfair and inadequate.'' <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors accepted the $ 29-a-share offer earlier this month in what some analysts described as an anti-takeover defense for the high-technology and specialty consumer products concern. In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely with boreowed money repaid from the target company's profits or asset sales. Stockholders want to prevent that deal from being completed. In complaints filed in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, they charge <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> would be worth a lot more in `` an open auction for the company.'' `` The directors have the duty to maximize shareholder value,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, wrote in one of five civil suits filed Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> disclosed in filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week that it received several unsolicited buyout offers since the management bid. It said it entered into confidentiality agreements with certain groups but declined to identify the parties. <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> Vice President and Treasurer <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Todt </PERSON> said Thursday the company believes the tender offer from management is fair. Named as defendants were <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION>, 12 directors and <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the new holding company created by <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> management to acquire the Meriden-based company. In recent years, <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION>, once known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has restructured itself into an industrial holding company with operating companies that make products for high-technology industries and speciality consumer markets. <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> makes Red Devil paints, Rolodex rotary files, metal cartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry and Dual-Lite emergency lighting equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 11.7 million, or 55 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $ 11 million, or 52 cents a share, last year. Revenue totaled $ 196.4 million, up from $ 154.3 million.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Lower In Unexpected Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, surprising many analysts who had expected a strong performance following the government's crop production report. Corn, oat and soybean futures opened sharply higher as expected but corn prices plunged their permitted daily limit shortly after the opening, sparking a sell-off in the adjacent trading pits. Only oat futures closed higher while most corn futures finished down the 10-cents-a-bushel limit. `` It's astonishing,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a report issued after the markets closed on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> predicted the drought would lower this year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn production by 37 compared to last year. The agency estimated soybean production at 23 percent below last year's level and said wheat production would drop by 14 percent. `` I guess the markets may be giving us a signal today that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report did not provide any new bullish information that was n't already in the market,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Merill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s soybean <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON> said traders apparently want to see signs of new export business before they are willing to bet on higher prices. At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.80 a bushel; corn was 4 \ cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.87 \ a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.80 a bushel; and soybeans were 11 cents lower to 6 cents higher with August at $ 8.50 a

 The securities arm of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said it fired two market-makers in stocks for insider trading. County <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodmac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that, as one of three stockbrokers of <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, it was informed on Monday that Grand Met was about to announce its intention to sell its Inter-Continental hotel chain after several parties had shown an interest. County <PERSON> Natwest </PERSON> said that `` through a breach of internal procedures, which did not involve -LRB- the -RRB- corporate finance department, this information reached two market-makers.'' The two market-makers, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, dealt in Grand Met shares even though they had been informed that they could not because they were `` in receipt of privileged information,'' the company said. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> traded 2 million pounds, or about $ 3.4 million, worth of shares of Grand Met, a major British hotels and beverage company, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> said Friday he is leaving as chairman of the pricey retailer <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION>, marking the end of the <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> family's affiliation with the deparment store founded by his grandfather in 1907. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, who was also chief executive of the 22-store, Dallas-based chain, said he would have no further direct connection with the famous retailer. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, 50, is the last founding family member to hold a corporate position in the 81-year-old <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> institution founded by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> that over the years has attracted international attention and prestige. Today, the Neiman-Marcus stores are part of <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also includes the retailers Bergdorf-Goodman and Contempo Casuals. <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns movie houses and soft-drink bottling concerns. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Questrom </PERSON>, 48, a former vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has been named president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> stores. <PERSON> Questrom </PERSON> left <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in May, after Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took control of the Cincinnati-based retailer. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>' resignation is effective Sept. 1, while <PERSON> Questrom </PERSON> will join the company Sept. 7, <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. For the past nine months, the company had been trying to fill the vacancy left by the departure of its president and chief operating officer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>. The title of chairman will not exist in the new Neiman-Marcus corporate structure, officials said. <PERSON> Questrom </PERSON> will report to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarr </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, who became chairman in 1978, said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News Thursday he felt comfortable with handing the reins to <PERSON> Questrom </PERSON> although he had not yet formulated his next business plans. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> joined the store in 1962 at age 24 as an assistant buyer. He moved up through the ranks and was named president 10 years later. `` Some management science book said 10 years as CEO is long enough, at least for the company, if not the individual,'' <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> said.

 The dollar fluctuated without direction against major foreign currencies Friday as traders began looking ahead to next week's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monthly trade figures. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 431 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 429.30 an ounce late Thursday. Traders are reluctant to hold big currency positions because of the possibility of a surprise Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> releases the June merchandise trade deficit. Many traders are expecting a shortfall of $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion. The deficit was $ 10.9 billion in May. The dollar was weakened only briefly by a government report that wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, foreign exchange and money market trading manager for <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dipple </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exterieure </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar still was suffering from a market perception that it moved a `` little too far, too quickly'' Tuesday when it shot up following the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s half-percentage point increase in its key bank lending rate, the discount rate In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7155 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.7010 Thursday. The dollar also weakened later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as sterling rose to $ 1.7130 from $ 1.7103. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar finished the week at 133.05 yen, down 1.02 yen from Thursday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.15 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 133.28 yen from 132.74 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.8833 West German marks, unchanged; 1.5777 Swiss francs, up from 1.5735; 1.2111 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2198; 6.3965 French francs, up from 6.3863; and 1,397.50 Italian lire, unchanged. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8995; 1.5750 Swiss francs, down from 1.5905; 6.3810 French francs, down from 6.4350; 2.1146 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1425; 1,395.50 Italian lire, down from 1,406.50; and 1.2195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2231.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices declined moderately Friday, rounding out a traumatic week of steep losses that catapulted interest rates to their highest levels this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond fell about -RRB- point, or $ 3.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.42 percent from 9.38 percent late Thursday. The yield on the 30-year bond has not been this high since Dec. 11, 1987, when it reached 9.44 percent. Bond prices took a beating this week after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate on Tuesday. The increase in the discount rate, the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to major financial institutions, was the first such hike since last October's stock market crash. A rise in interest rates sends bond prices lower. The central bank raised the discount rate a half-percentage point, to 6.5 percent, to stem inflationary pressure on the economy. Many market watchers had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply _ but few were anticipating that dramatic a move. `` It's just been a lousy week,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. He suggested that Friday's more tempered decline in bond values was caused by a residue of negative sentiment from the week. The yield on the key 30-year issue jumped from 9.10 percent on Monday, the day before the discount-rate hike, to Friday's 9.42 percent. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds Friday, prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point lower, intermediate maturities slipped 5-32 point to 3-16 point, and 20-year issues lost 5-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, edged up 0.67 to 1,126.55. Corporate bonds were slightly lower. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slipped 0.02 to 280.28. Three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, edged up 1 basis point to a discounted rate of 7.00 percent and a yield of 7.21 percent. Six-month bills rose 3 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.45 percent to yield 7.84 percent while one-year bills were up 1 basis point at 7.65 percent to yield 8.21 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 -LRB- percent, up from 8 1-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Shamrock Boosts Offer for Polaroid But Camera Giant Takes No
Action</HEAD>

 An investment firm owned by a <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> family scion sweetened its takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, and the camera company's board met for six hours before postponing action on the offer. Analysts interpreted the new offer by <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as an effort to gradually raise the stakes for the instant camera pioneer. `` It's all part of a very delicate quadrille being danced by a large number of players and all we're seeing is the first two steps,'' one Wall Street analyst said. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s new offer was $ 40 a share plus giving stockholders the right to 40 percent of any settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.7 billion patent infringement case against <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. That bettered the July 22 bid, which offered a flat $ 40 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, or about $ 2.3 billion, but attached several contingencies On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell $ 1 a share to $ 42.12 -LCB-. After the board meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement no action was taken because of the new bid. The 13-member board planned to meet again to consider the offer, but no date was set, spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Analysts said <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s bid fell short of what <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> would be willing to consider but might be part of a strategy to heighten interest in the company that introduced instant snapshots more than 50 years ago. `` I think they do n't expect it to be a blitzkrieg,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think they're prepared for a drawn-out struggle or possibly even drawn-out negotiations. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, wholly owned by the family of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, nephew of the late <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, has interests in three television and 14 radio stations, an energy services company and 56 home entertainment software stores in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The company failed in an attempt last year to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Wherehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which analysts said raises questions about its ability to go after <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, which reported sales of $ 13.3 billion last year. `` They're trying to prove they're for real but nobody's too sure,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Relyea </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Eberstadt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's a very healthy degree of skepticism about what they're up to.'' In its new bid, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, which owns 6.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, rescinded an earlier requirement making a deal contingent on <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> dropping a $ 190 million pension surplus plan. But it said it would continue to fight a recently announced employee stock ownership plan that includes the issue of 10 million new shares. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said it had retained <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to assist in securing about $ 1 billion in financing. The new offer was made in a letter from <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> chairman <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>. `` We are willing to meet with you at any time to discuss how best to implement the furnishing of such an interest to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> wrote in the letter dated Thursday and released Friday <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has filed suit in a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court seeking to overturn the employee stock plan, part of a corporate restructuring that includes 500 to 800 layoffs, a $ 300 million stock repurchase and entry into the conventional film market. Polaroid is officially a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> company. Under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law, an acquiring company must have at least 85 percent of the target company's stock to complete a merger. By placing 14 percent of its stock in employee hands, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has effectively put the 85 percent target out of reach. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s lawsuit charges that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> enacted the plan as an antitakeover device. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said in March the plan would equal 5 percent of company stock but raised the amount about 10 days before the first Shamrock bid. Analysts called the new bid speculative because it depends on settling the patent infringement case against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, which was found guilty in 1985 of violating several Polaroid patents on instant cameras and film. The $ 5.7 billion damages trial is set to begin in January. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s takeover bid values the company at about $ 2.88 billion if all 71.9 million shares remain outstanding. If the stock issue is rolled back, the value of the company implied by the bid would be $ 2.48 billion. Since <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> already owns a chunk of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock, its cost to buy the rest would be $ 2.28 billion, assuming defeat of the share issue, or $ 2.68 billion if the share issue is not defeated.

<HEAD>Maxwell Sets Tender Offer for Macmillan, But Willing To Talk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said Friday he will launch a $ 2.1 billion cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> next week, but made clear his main interest is acquiring its information services business. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> already is the subject of a $ 1.9 billion bid from <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Texas-based investment group. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said he would drop his $ 80-a-share tender offer if <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> would sell him the information company, which <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> proposed to separate from its publishing business in a corporate restructuring. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC would be willing to pay `` not less than $ 1.1 billion'' in cash for the information business, noting that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s investment bankers had valued it at `` a range of $ 800 million to slightly in excess of $ 1 billion. In the letter, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> also told <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> he was `` willing to explore other forms of transactions with you'' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a significant stake in the company. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> also reitereated he wanted to retain <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> management. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s proposals. On Wall Street, the price of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.50 a share to $ 83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate. `` Some people suggested <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> is n't serious, but by launching a tender offer at $ 80 a share on Monday, we see he is serious,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, who follows the publishing business for the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> said by making the alternate suggestion that he be sold the information assets, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> `` identified the piece he is most interested in.'' `` I think <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> is backed up against the wall and will try to find a white knight,'' he said. He said <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> could be worth $ 90 a share. The overture from <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> came only three days before a scheduled court hearing in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> on whether <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> should be allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring. The restructuring, announced in late May, would split the company into separate publishing and information services concerns and pay shareholders a special dividend of $ 52.35 a share in cash. That plan was advanced after the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> proposed to pay $ 64 a share for the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock it did not already own. The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> subsequently sweetened its offer twice, and launched its own tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> at $ 75 a share. The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> won an order from <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> blocking <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> from proceeding with its restructuring. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> appealed the decision to <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which scheduled a hearing for Monday. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> disclosed his interest in <LOCATION> Macmillan </LOCATION> in mid-July, saying he would be interested in paying $ 80 a share for its 25.9 million shares in a friendly transaction. A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender offer at that price would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping the restructuring plan, among other things, but <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said it is not conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing. Late last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> board rejected the $ 75 a share offer from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> proposal. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refused Friday to comment on whether the board has since met to discuss the <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> proposal, or anything else. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has vowed to make <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> one of the world's biggest media and communications businesses. Through that company and <ORGANIZATION> Pergamon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> controls the <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, is one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest printers of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing academic and scientific journals.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Decline Despite Bullish Crop Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, astonishing analysts who had expected a strong performance following the government's pessimistic crop production report. The volatility of the grain markets, attributed by some to massive trades by a handful of firms, sent tremors through several other commodity markets that frequently look to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for direction. Sugar and cotton futures plunged; livestock and meat futures were mostly lower; precious metals advanced; energy futures were lower; and stock-index futures retreated. Corn, oat and soybean futures opened sharply higher as expected. But corn prices plunged their permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel shortly after the opening, sparking a sell-off in the adjacent trading pits. Only oat futures closed higher while most corn futures finished limit down. `` It's astonishing,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I really do n't understand it. `` I've been doing this for eight years and this is my most frustrating day ever,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a report issued Thursday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> predicted the <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> drought would lower this year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn production by 37 percent, soybean production by 23 percent and wheat production by 14 percent compared to last year's Analysts had expected a sharp rise in crop futures prices Friday, reflecting the increasing value of diminishing grain supplies. But after the initial surge, several large trading firms sold huge amounts of corn, which sent corn prices plummeting. Traders said Chicago-based C & amp; D Commodities sold at least 20 million bushels of corn alone. Other large sellers reportedly included <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said a handful of firms were bullying the grain markets But <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s soybean analyst, said the sell-off would not had occurred if the market's major players had truly been surprised by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop estimates. `` I guess the markets may be giving us a signal today that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report did not provide any new bullish information that was n't already in the market,'' <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON> said Wheat settled 1 cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.79 -RCB- bushel; corn was 3 -RCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.87 \ a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.80 a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 8.48 -LCB- a bushel Cotton futures prices collapsed in reaction to the crop report, which projected a 1.2 percent increase in cotton production while virtually every analyst was expecting a reduction. Cotton futures settled down the 2-cents-a-pound limit across the board on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for October delivery at 53.28 cents a pound. Sugar futures followed the grain markets' wild swing and closed sharply lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's an old saying: ` When in doubt, get out,''' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON>, a sugar trader with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If you do n't understand the market, do n't get into it, get out of it.'' Sugar for October delivery settled .63 cent lower at 10.77 cents a pound. Cattle and pork futures finished mixed to lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the lower grain futures _ portending lower feed prices and possibly higher meat supplies _ were the main influence. Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August at 69.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 81.05 cents a pound; hogs were 1.12 cents lower to .28 cent higher with August at 46.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to 1.55 cents lower with August at 34.17 cents a pound. Precious metals futures advanced on news that wholesale prices climbed 0.5 percent in July, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodity futures trading adviser for <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 26 cents lower with September at $ 15.52 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent to .56 cent lower with September at 44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .04 cent to .53 cent lower with September at 45.98 cents a gallon.

 Takeover target <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported its second-quarter net income slipped 9 percent despite higher sales. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it was extending its $ 1.95 billion bid for the pubishing and information services giant. The Texas-based Bass group has been joined by British media magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> in the bid for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>. Net income for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $ 13.2 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $ 14.5 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The company noted that 1987 results reflected a $ 3.8 million gain from the sale of the company's software division Revenue during the quarter rose 11 percent to $ 241 million, compared with $ 217.5 million in the second quarter of 1987. For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 10.6 million, or 43 cents a share, down 12 percent from $ 12 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue during the first two quarters were up 11 percent at $ 423.6 million, from $ 382.6 million a year ago. The Bass group began bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> in May. Its $ 75-a-share tender offer for the company, which was to expire Friday, has been extended to Aug. 26. The Bass group apparently wants to keep its offer alive while the two sides meet again in court. A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 15 in <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s bid to overturn a preliminary injunction that the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had granted Bass in an effort to block <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s defensive restructuring plan. While the two sides were squabbling in court, <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> came on the scene with an $ 80-a-share bid that values <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> at $ 2.32 billion. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s bid is conditioned upon termination of <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s restructuring plan and redemption of the company's poison pill

<HEAD>GM Raises Prices on 1989 Cars</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will raise prices of its 1989 automobiles an average of 2.9 percent because of higher manufacturing costs. New prices announced by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> include increases up to 4.6 percent for the redesigned, larger 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sedan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeVille </ORGANIZATION>, and more than 5 percent from current discounted levels for the popular <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corsica </ORGANIZATION> four-door sedan. Prices of some cars, including <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s most expensive, the $ 56,533 <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allante </ORGANIZATION>, and its least expensive, the $ 6,399 <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeMans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coupe </ORGANIZATION>, will be unchanged, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Comptroller <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhame </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said, discounts on options have cut prices of some models enough so that even with the increases, their 1989 introductory prices will be down from a year earlier. `` For example, the 1989 introductory prices for the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corsica </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION>, two of our most popular cars, are on average 4 percent to 5 percent lower than their comparably equipped counterparts at 1988 introductory price levels,'' he said. <PERSON> Rhame </PERSON> said that as an example, the manufacturer's suggested retail price at the start of the 1988 model year for a <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> with options including air conditioning, automatic transmission, tilt wheel, tinted glass, rear window defogger and cruise control was $ 11,618. With options discounts, the price of that car now would be $ 10,618, he said. For 1989 it will be $ 11,168, a 5.2 percent increase, but still down 3.9 percent from the 1988 introductory level. The base price of the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sedan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeVille </ORGANIZATION> will rise to $ 25,435 from $ 23,404 for 1988, <PERSON> Rhame </PERSON> said. The high-volume Chevrolet Cavalier 4-door sedan will have a base price of $ 8,595, up from $ 8,195, with the addition of rear-seat shoulder belts as standard equipment for 1989, he said. Base prices will drop on some models, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Calais </ORGANIZATION> two-door coupe, which will start at $ 9,995, down from a 1988 base price of $ 10,320. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck prices will increase an average of 3 percent, <PERSON> Rhame </PERSON> said, although specific truck prices were not released. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced price increases for 1989 ranging from 1.9 percent to 5.3 percent on six of its most popular cars. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said in late July it will raise 1989 prices an average of 3 percent, with increases up to 9 percent on some popular models such as mini-vans.
