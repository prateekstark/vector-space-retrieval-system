 Lawmakers who have been tied up by the impeachment trials of three federal judges in as many years are calling for a change in the Constitution to hand such trials to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the 12-member trial committee that heard the case of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> earlier this month, said Friday that he would propose a constitutional amendment to relieve <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of its impeachment duties `` They ought to be the ultimate triers of fact,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices. `` They are the most qualified. They have the constitutional perspective on both the protections and sensitivity of federal judgeships,'' he said. He said the justices also have more time for the lengthy process required to remove judges from the federal bench. The amendment would pertain only to the federal judiciary, leaving the trial of other public officials impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who said he would sponsor the proposal with Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, D-N.Y. An impeachment voted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> serves as an indictment for trial before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to then remove an official from office and disqualify the person from holding other federal office. There only have been 15 impeachments by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for trial in the 200-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but three of them have been in the last three years and all of the last three were federal judges. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he spent all of August studying the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> case prior to the four-day trial before his special 12-member committee earlier this month. The full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take no less than two days to hear the case, debate and vote. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings in the impeachment case against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> took four weeks last summer and are awaiting action by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The impeachment and trial of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> in 1986 took the committee 10 days to hear and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 18 hours to consider before voting to remove <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> from office. According to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who was majority leader at the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor proceedings took more time than all but a handful of major issues before the 98th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Under the Constitution, the federal judges are appointed for life and can be removed from office only by voluntary resignation, death or trial by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s plan for a constitutional amendment is not the first call for a change in the discipline of federal judges. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the administration of justice, has proposed strengthening federal laws governing the judges and setting up a commission to study the impeachment process

<HEAD>President Defends Arranged Crack Sale for Drug Speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says it does n't really matter that a drug dealer was coaxed into selling crack cocaine near the White House _ just so the president could tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that's where the sale took place. `` The man went there and sold drugs in front of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, did n't he?'' the president told reporters in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Friday. `` That's the bottom line. That's what the man did.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> concede the drug dealer was maneuvered into making a previously arranged sale in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, across the street from the White House. The president displayed the cocaine in a see-through plastic bag in his nationally televised drug strategy speech on Sept. 5. He told the audience the crack had been `` seized a few days ago in a park across the street from the White House.'' A Democratic senator from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, criticized the president's use of the prop as `` staged.'' `` Is this really a drug war, or is this theatrics and screenplay?'' he asked. `` We do n't need the president to lure drug pushers to <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> for photo opportunities.'' And a reporter suggested to the president that the transaction would n't have taken place in the park had the cocaine not been needed for the speech. `` The message I get out of it -LRB- is -RRB- a man was busted in front of the White House and I can not feel sorry for him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He ought not to be out peddling these insidious drugs. It's ruining the children of this country.'' The president said he'd asked for a drug sample `` from that vicinity to show it can happen anywhere ... and that's what they gave me. And they told me where they caught this guy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke as if the suspected dealer, a teenager, had been arrested. Although the transaction with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent was photographed, the dealer was not taken into custody, agents said, because they hoped he would sell a larger amount later and identify his organization. A planned arrest earlier this week fell through when the suspect did not show up, and agents hope to obtain indictments against him. Asked if the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people were manipulated into thinking drugs were being sold near the White House, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` What do you mean it did n't really -LRB- happen -RRB-? The guy was arrested or grabbed for selling drugs in front of the White House. It did n't exist? It did n't happen?'' On every drug bust, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` You bring somebody someplace.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> became irritated with reporters' questions, gesturing toward the press at one point and saying, `` I do n't understand. Are these advocates here for this drug guy?'' But while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the arrangement, another senior <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had been `` a little overzealous.'' `` We told them that if a buy could be made near the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, so much the better. They took us literally,'' said the official, asking not to be identified.

<HEAD>Congressman Apologizes for Dealing With Prostitute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is offering an apology to political supporters and assuring them that `` my judgment has improved'' since his involvement with a male prostitute. `` I made some serious mistakes in judgment several years ago. What I did was wrong,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, said in a letter mailed Friday to home-state supporters and volunteers in his previous campaigns for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It did not affect my public decisions or any public business,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote. `` But I regret that some of my past personal actions are troubling to people who placed their confidence in me.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> also drew some Republican support Friday for his decision not to resign while awaiting an inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee into his 18-month relationship with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. `` He deserves a fair hearing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the House Republican whip. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who is under investigation by the ethics committee over his personal finances in a book deal, told reporters it was appropriate for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to await the panel's findings. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is a five-term congressman and outspoken liberal who was re-elected overwhelmingly in 1988 after disclosing the year before that he is homosexual. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> has charged he operated a prostitution ring out of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Capitol Hill apartment <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has acknowledged paying <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> for sex and then hiring him as a personal assistant and driver, but says he threw <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> out when he learned of the prostitution operation. That was shortly before <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> publicly disclosed he is homosexual. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, in his letter, said the pressure of hiding his homosexuality while maintaining a political life led him to deal with the prostitute. `` Dealing with being gay, while continuing to meet my public obligations, created tremendous internal pressures,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote. `` Those pressures ended when I spoke publicly about my own personal identity. Not coincidentally, my judgment has improved since then.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that as a result of being in public life, `` I can not be surprised that my mistakes in personal judgment of several years ago have now become public knowledge.'' But he said that `` some highly sensationalized stories'' about the matter have included `` substantial untruths.'' `` It was to end any question about what is the truth that I asked the ethics committee of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider this entire matter,'' he wrote. `` I need hardly tell you that this committee will have my full cooperation. Meanwhile, I hope you will accept my apology.'' Aides to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the letter was widely distributed to veteran supporters, and was not mailed at government expense.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to lead the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> says a measure by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> to stop federal funding of sexually explicit or blasphemous art would cripple the government's role in promoting artistic excellence. `` Making unfettered artistic judgments would be most difficult under the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee considering his nomination. `` I think we need freedom ... and tolerance ... for art to flourish,'' the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, lawyer told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. The arts agency is at the center of a political storm resulting from the use of federal money in exhibits that included works by artists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>'s photographs depict explicit homosexual acts and <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> displayed a work showing a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in July adopted an amendment by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that would prohibit the agency from using any of its $ 170 million in annual appropriations to promote, distribute or produce `` obscene and indecent materials'' or art that denigrates the beliefs of any religion. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted against <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' measure 264-153 last week after endowment defenders complained it would establish a broad pattern of censorship that would destroy the agency's credibility in the arts community. The endowment uses panels of experts to award subsidies each year to artists. `` I do not believe in funding obscene art,'' <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` I would certainly hate to see the whole structure change because of some grants which are controversial.''

<HEAD>FDA Panel Suggests Stronger Warnings on Sleep-Drug Side Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal advisory committee says the world's leading sleep medication, Halcion, may put users at greater risk of temporary amnesia than other drugs of its kind <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> panel recommended Friday that the warning be added to Halcion's label and that stronger warnings be given to consumers and doctors about all possible side effects for this drug and other sedative-hypnotics, which are sold only by prescription. The <ORGANIZATION> Psychopharmacological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to work out the language of the warnings. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leber </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s division of neuropharmacological drug products, said it would be at least six months before the agency would complete work on the warnings. `` There's no sense of urgency on this,'' he said. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Halcion, said the committee's review should put to rest many concerns that have been raised about the drug. The recommendations resulted from the committee's review of a `` relatively high'' number of reports about side effects associated with the use of Halcion compared with other sedative-hypnotics. These included amnesia, anxiety, aggression and hallucinations, all of which are included in the warning label for Halcion. Panel members said the high number of reactions reported may be overstated, since incomplete data on incidents was collected and it can be used only as a broad indicator. `` Given the limitations of the information, we did not sense there was a special problem'' of side effects with Halcion, said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, panel chairman and chief of psychiatric research and psychopharmacology at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Halcion was approved for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1983 and about 43 million prescriptions of the drug have been written since then The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has received 1,693 reports of adverse side effects possibly associated with its use, ranging from amnesia to death, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Anello </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of epidemiology and biostatistics. By comparison, 35 million prescriptions have been written for Restoril, a sedative-hypnotic made by <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, since 1981 and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has received 266 reports of unwanted side effects, he said. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Halcion, said the greater number of Halcion reports could be the result of a number of things, including media reports about the drug. These include reports about a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> woman shot her mother last year after taking Halcion. Charges against the woman were dismissed. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the company was `` pleased the advisory committee has essentially come to the conclusion that there are few if any concerns that need to be addressed.'' Besides agreeing to recommend relabeling for Halcion for temporary amnesia, the panel decided to address concerns for the entire class of sleeping pills. Three drugs are included in this class _ Halcion, Restoril and Dalmane. Panel members asked the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to `` provide material to consumers to alert them to the possibility of side effects'' of the drugs so the consumers could discuss them with their doctors. Committee members said they were concerned about `` traveler's amnesia'' _ a temporary syndrome that can affect travelers who take one of the drugs They can function normally after awakening but later wo n't recall their activities during this period, such as going through Customs at the airport. The labels for these drugs already warn of amnesia as a possible side effect, but the committee recommended the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> consider adding `` traveler's amnesia'' to the labels.

<HEAD>Navy Cleaning Up ``Catastrophic'' Hurricane Damage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> crews are beginning to clean up `` catastrophic levels of damage'' at the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and sweep wreckage at other bases and military ships that were caught in the path of Hurricane Hugo. No serious injuries were reported at several bases along the eastern seaboard, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Friday, but two firefighters at the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> base sustained minor injuries. A nuclear attack submarine was knocked from its moorings in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> harbor and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer was sideswiped by a barge tossed in the waves whipped by the hurricane's winds. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> treated the military installations no differently from the rest of the ravaged <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, ripping apart poles with power lines and wiping out power and communications at facilities. The information from the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> base, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s main installations on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, was sketchy. `` Many roofs off, many windows out, ... most trees down,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` Preliminary reports of catastrophic levels of damage'' had been received. A few airplane hangar doors were knocked off during the storm but the aircraft inside were not damaged, the statement said. The base is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> 437th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> 315th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The USS Narwhal, a nuclear attack submarine that was tied up at the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shipyard, broke loose from its moorings, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON>. The crew submerged the sub as a safety precaution, he said, and later returned to the surface without incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said the USS Dewey, a guided missile destroyer, was damaged by a barge that broke free and scraped the side of the ship, and several small boats assigned to a submarine squadron were sunk at the pier. `` Widespread flooding'' occurred and electricity has been disrupted at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base, but emergency power has been made available at `` vital installations.'' Limited telephone service was restored Friday, the statement said. The Naval Hospital was reported operating and providing assistance to local residents, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, reported `` major damage'' to its housing area with `` many trees and power lines'' down. No injuries occurred at the base, where the wall of the commissary caved in, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. At <ORGANIZATION> Myrtle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, moderate structural damage occurred to some buildings, and only emergency generators were providing power. The Army reported a `` widespread power outage and minor flooding'' at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, which was directly in the path of the hurricane. Minor damage occurred to one of the barracks, the statement said.

 The co-pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing two people, inadvertently pushed a button that caused the 737-400 to decelerate, federal officials said Friday after interviewing the cockpit crew. The pilot tried to increase the throttle manually, the plane began to veer to the left and the pilot, feeling a vibration, aborted the takeoff, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON>, acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> did not specify a precise cause for Wednesday's 11:29 p.m. crash, when Flight 5050, bound for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, skidded off the runway into the waters off <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` He initiated the abort because of the drift,'' <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said the plane has automatic throttles that are programmed prior to takeoff by the flight crew. The button that the co-pilot, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON>, 29, should have pushed would have automatically accelerated the plane to a preset speed for takeoff, he said. But <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> inadvertently hit the disengage button, he said. As the plane continued down the runway, pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 36, jumped in to try to increase the throttle manually. The plane started drifting to the left and `` the pilot felt and heard a vibration which concerned him,'' <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. A senior flight attendant and a passenger also reported feeling the vibration, he said. As the plane accelerated down the runway, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said, the flight crew did not call out the jet's speed to each other as is mandatory. `` It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit,'' <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The co-pilot, meanwhile, told investigators he was looking out the front window when he realized the captain was going to abort the flight, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The pilot, referring to an earlier flight that day, told officials `` the co-pilot's performance suggested that he was obviously new,'' <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said it was the co-pilot's first operational takeoff on a 737-400 following completion of flight training. After the crash, the pilot and co-pilot helped passengers get out of the plane, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The pilot took a rescue boat to the airport and then a taxi to the <LOCATION> Marriott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, where he called his union representative, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> earlier Friday suspended the flight licenses of the pilot and co-pilot because both men left the scene after the accident and could not be questioned by investigators, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>. `` For these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 hours after an accident that took two lives and to do so with no explanation is highly questionable,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There are many questions that only they can answer relating to public safety.'' Both men may appeal the suspension but would need to go through a recertification procedure to get their licenses back. Interviews with the flight crew indicated that the pilot `` was not exhibiting any abnormal behavior'' before the takeoff, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday evening. <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said the co-pilot, <LOCATION> Kleissaf </LOCATION>, apologized for having said the pilot, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, was incoherent before the takeoff. <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> had reportedly said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had been acting irrationally just before he ordered the plane's takeoff aborted. `` I regret that I put that in those words,'' <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> told the investigators. Both men have submitted to urine tests but the results were not yet available, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> were not required to remain at the accident scene. `` They had gone through a very traumatic experience,'' he said. `` They had helped the passengers, they wanted to leave the scene.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s whereabouts were unknown the day after the crash, but <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said that was not unusual in plane crash investigations. <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said both pilots went to a hospital for treatment Thursday, which he said partially explains their absence. `` I do n't feel they've hampered the investigation,'' he said `` It is difficult for me to say they were stonewalling us.'' Investigators arranged Thursday through the pilots' union and the airline to interview the pilots, who had been subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> but appeared before investigators voluntarily, authorities said. The senior flight attendant on the plane, at an emotional news conference with three of his co-workers from Flight 5050, said both pilots assisted in rescue efforts after the crash. But the attendant, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, refused to comment on the captain's behavior except to say, `` He was assisting me in any way he could.'' Also Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in response to what it called `` a number of erroneous news reports and inappropriate speculations'' about the crash and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s alleged irrational behavior `` There was nothing unusual in the crew's performance, no federal rules were broken and the crew has cooperated completely with the investigation,'' the pilots' union said. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> also denied that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> disappeared after the crash. A <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> representative contacted <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> after the crash and told him to check into a <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> hotel and stay there, the union said. `` When he was unable to obtain a room at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, he went to the home of another pilot to rest and recuperate,'' the union's statement said `` There he remained in contact with the company, which knew his whereabouts at all times.'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had been in contact with any airline official. `` He did not contact us and we did not tell him to go to the hotel,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. In another effort to determine what caused the crash, investigators began removing pieces of the plane from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Friday morning, said <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. The 11:29 p.m. crash Wednesday cracked the plane into three pieces, which were partly submerged. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that according to airline industry officials, the captain had flown 737s for only two months and the first officer was in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records show <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> received his commercial pilot's license in October 1987 and an instructor's license six months later. His <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> record is completely clean, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>.

The deaths were <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s first in 17 years. The plane was delivered in January and had no history of mechanical problems, said airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered most <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s grounded because of two incidents in which engines failed.

Ms. <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON> ca n't see what's wrong with her sign because other residents decorate their doors with mezuzas _ Biblical inscriptions in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> meant to be hung on doorposts. `` Are we in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?

<HEAD>Cable Company Offers to Blackout ``Last Temptation of Christ''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A cable television company is asking its <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION> subscribers whether they want the cable company to blackout the scheduled showing next month of the movie `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' When the movie was released last year, many fundamentalist religious groups objected, with mass demonstrations and picketing of theaters where it was shown. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the movie was only shown in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. Because of that controversy, Bismarck-Mandan Cable TV sent its 1,800 <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION> subscribers a letter saying it is considering blacking out the five showings of the film in October. The company also sent subscribers a card with two boxes to check _ a box in favor of the blackout and a box against it. `` As we examined it, we said it looks like a no-win situation,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. `` Jot'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, manager of the cable company. `` If we aired the movie there will probably be a lot of protests like last year in the theaters. And if we censor the movie or blackout there would be a lot of protests from people saying you should n't do that.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he will have an announce the results of the balloting on Wednesday. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON>, who asked not to be identified said he did n't want to comment on the movie but said the company's general policy is that <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION> have the final say over programming. Local cable operators do not have the right to blackout the movies, he said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Bismarck-Mandan Cable TV's contract allows it. `` We do have a clause in there which says that we can make a decision if there's some programming we feel is not proper to community standards, we would have the right to black it out,'' he said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said that clause is used only as a last resort and added the cable company has never exercised that option.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing that killed 10 men and blew apart a building at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school. A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between practice sessions on the school's parade ground. Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them in serious condition, police said. They said nine of the dead were bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified. Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English seaside town of Deal were damaged. Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all were trained, adult musicians. They held military ranks but none had been trained as a fighting soldier. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, engaged in a 20-year-old campaign to drive the British from the province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility in a telephone call to <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> news agency. Residents of the area adjoining the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> school said Friday that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably. `` Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the base,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Verge </PERSON>, a 70-year-old army veteran. Local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance to the barracks. `` There is a great sense of anger'' in the community, <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> police Chief Constable <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is one of 30 military establishments in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that use private security firms, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures show. Unidentified defense sources quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper today said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who patrolled regularly inside the perimeter. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> promised a security review and said new measures had already been taken at the base. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on defense, said on Friday: `` Serious questions must be asked about the penny-pinching policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, which may well put our armed services at dreadful risk.'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> later told <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was `` prepared to take out anybody. The cowardly nature of their attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat.'' He said private security firms were assigned to areas considered low risks for attacks. `` If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it is likely they will be attacked, given the way that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is forced to operate,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> added. `` The big prizes are no longer available to them, so they're picking off the ones which they regard vulnerable.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> received news of the bombing while aboard a jet over <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> en route from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. She called it a `` deeply serious outrage.'' King visited the scene soon after the explosion. `` I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers who sent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going to make any difference; that it is just killing for the sake of killing,'' he said. The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack `` redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism can not win.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> condemned the attack and sent Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> a message of sympathy at `` this outrage ... which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries.'' The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the operation, but said it was a response to a `` message of war'' delivered by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> when she visited <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> nine days ago. It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> as `` a very, very brave group of men'' who have lost 179 members in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks since 1970. The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> as a sectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegations that some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects to <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> assassins. British military installations are a frequent target of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign. Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982 when 11 servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The music school trains young recruits for the seven Royal Marines bands. Up to 250 young men, most ages 16 to 20, undergo military and musical training there, working with older, professional bandsmen.

 Many residents of this hurricane-ravaged city mounted bicycles to check on their homes and friends, dodging toppled trees, wind-sheared roofs, broken gas lights and other debris. Hurricane Hugo's torrential rains and 135 mph winds caused an estimated $ 1 billion in damages in historic <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> imposed a 7 p.m. curfew Friday to deter looting, and 1,400 National Guardsmen joined police in patrolling the streets early today. Among those pushing pedals were Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, his wife and two daughters. Their golden retriever, `` Snickers,'' maneuvered around the debris on foot. `` We did n't know which streets would be under water,'' said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sadlers </ORGANIZATION> spent Thursday night in <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>, about 25 miles inland, when it became clear <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> would get the brunt of Hugo. The family returned to the battered city Friday morning to check on damage, finding streets littered with planks, window frames, shards of glass and other debris. Many of the city's historic homes were damaged and its big oak trees topped by the force of the storm. `` I could n't imagine it being as bad as they were saying,'' said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Francie </PERSON>. `` I did n't want to believe it. I cried when I came back into town.'' Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisdale </PERSON> said he decided to use his 10-speed bicycle because his car was low on gasoline and because some streets were impassable in cars. `` Given the problems with the streets, it's easier and faster in many cases to get around on bicycles,'' he said. In the luggage rack of his bicycle, <PERSON> Tisdale </PERSON> carried a folded blue tarp that had covered his desk during the storm. <PERSON> Tisdale </PERSON> said his office was not damaged, but a friend's roof was gone. <PERSON> Tisdale </PERSON> planned to give the tarp to his friend to cover the gaping hole. Another bicyclist, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, stopped for a break at a street corner across the street from City Hall, whose metal roof was blown off. `` It's the only way to get around,'' she said. `` I came out to look at family homes. One's water damaged. One's roof is damaged. One's OK, except we'd like to take a bath.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said she did n't think <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> would cause such extensive damage. `` Lots of trees are down,'' she said. <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> peddled along Meeting Street, past damaged motels and shops, to check the homes of friends who had evacuated. `` Everything is in shock right now,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, a high school junior.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s war on drugs is caught in a partisan battle in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, with Democrats trying to add prevention and treatment money and Republicans arguing the revision would weaken the defense budget. `` If we're not willing to spend $ 150 million more, this is no war,'' Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said Friday after a week of closed-door efforts to reach a compromise failed. The talks broke off Friday and no new negotiations were scheduled. Republicans were proposing to add $ 850 million to the $ 7.9 billion program <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced two weeks ago and Democrats were holding out for an additional $ 1 billion, with no further talks scheduled. The parties also were at odds over how to distribute cuts in programs for money to go to the anti-drug effort. The breakdown threatened to create a logjam of money bills in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> just before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year when the funds ordinarily would be needed. Lawmakers said they might pass a stopgap measure to keep federal workers on the job and benefit checks flowing. The chief Republican negotiator, Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., said the two sides were actually fairly close and said he hoped the parties would take `` a clear-eyed, Monday morning view'' and resume bargaining `` We have to wage this war and the sooner we get at it the better it's going to be,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> negotiator, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been `` a shadow participant'' in the negotiations and that its reluctance to compromise was the key `` There comes a time when you have to fish or cut bait,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Republican lawmakers said they were frequently on the phone to White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> on Thursday when a marathon bargaining session ended at midnight. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was in the office of Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Friday morning for a strategy session with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators, national drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Of the $ 1 billion Democrats would add, $ 800 million would be aimed at stemming demand for drugs through education and prevention programs and through treatment. The rest would go to local law enforcement. Democrats would finance their program with an across-the-board cut of 0.3 percent in federal spending plus selected cuts to be determined by congressional subcommittees. Republicans were offering to add $ 850 million to the program, including $ 750 million for the so-called demand side programs of treatment and prevention and the rest for local law enforcement. They would get additional money through a 0.4 percent across-the-board cut in spending, <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. But Republicans were holding out for additional flexibility to protect defense procurement from the full brunt of across-the-board cuts. Since the bargaining began, <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> cut their proposed increase by more than half to compromise with Republicans. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s initial plan, with its across-the-board reduction of more than 0.5 percent, would have been too hard on defense. And inclusion of selected cuts also represented a partial concession to Republican demands. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told a news conference that Republicans asked for concessions `` and we said, <LOCATION> OK </LOCATION>, we'll do that, but lets beef up that treatment side, that prevention side.'' He and other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers dismissed the notion that their proposal would weaken defense. `` The administration was unwilling to let a $ 300 billion defense budget bear a less than one-half of one percent cut to beef up the war on drugs,'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., told reporters

<HEAD>Governor Orders Clinic Closed, Seeks New Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is seeking emergency rules to protect women at private abortion clinics in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after ordering a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> clinic closed because of reports of botched abortions. `` This is a pure pro-health issue,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said at a Friday news conference. `` This is for the health of individuals irregardless of philosophy on the substance of the abortion issue.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Coler </PERSON> to `` take all steps necessary to remove the license of this clinic.'' The action comes after reports of improper abortions by unlicensed physicians resulting in ruptured uteri and hysterectomies at the <ORGANIZATION> Dadeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, now doing business as the Women's Service Center `` There is no legal reason, no health reason, for this order,'' responded <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, director of the center. `` We've done nothing against the law. We've helped thousands of women. I see this as totally ludicrous.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, the governor's general counsel, said any emergency regulations drawn up by HRS for abortion clinics would be in effect for 90 days. After that, the new rules would be subject to public hearings and HRS board approval to become permanent. By that time, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will have decided whether to go along with <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s proposals to further restrict access to abortions. The session is scheduled for Oct. 10-13. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has denied he was trying to bypass the Legislature by using the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> situation to enact emergency regulations. Yet in his letter to <PERSON> Coler </PERSON>, the governor said conditions at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> clinic `` are precisely why I have called for increased regulation of abortion clinics to protect the health of women.'' The new rules, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, will not be as strict as his proposal for the special session to make private abortion clinics adhere to the same standards as ambulatory care clinics. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said HRS should not be blamed for the problems at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> clinic, saying the agency does n't have the power at present to uncover them. He said he does n't know whether abortion clinics throughout the state have similar practices. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, the governor's chief of operations, said veterinary clinics have more stringent regulations than abortion centers. Neither <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> would be specific about the kinds of regulations being sought, but both said they would be designed to protect the health of women seeking abortions _ not to restrict their access to an abortion.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> created the American popular song. Until <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> began writing after the turn of the century, American music was dominated by <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ English music hall, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, Viennese operetta and Italian opera. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> took native American sounds, such as ragtime, and turned them into huge popular hits like `` Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and `` Everybody's Doin' It Now. When <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> wrote, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> listened _ for more than 50 years. `` He caught the voices of the people early in this century and held them for longer than anyone else,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, musical theater historian, said Friday. From his first song, `` Marie of <LOCATION> Sunny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' in 1907 to his last Broadway show, `` Mr. President,'' in 1962, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s presence was felt on the music scene in this country. No one today can look to such a long period of domination. And <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was a winner in every medium he tried. He found success not only in Tin Pan Alley but on Broadway with musicals like `` Annie Get Your Gun,'' `` Call Me Madam'' and his Music Box revues, and in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> where he wrote the scores for <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire-Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> movies like `` Top Hat'' and `` Follow the Fleet'' and other films like `` Holiday Inn'' and `` Easter Parade.'' His colleagues thought he was the best, particularly contemporaries like <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>. He had an enormous influence on the Broadway composers who followed him, especially <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> who relished his inventive way with rhythm. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> also had an incredible versatility, a great intelligence and perspective about the world. He could write any kind of song _ a stirring, patriotic anthem like `` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a seasonal standard like `` White Christmas,'' a comic theater ditty like `` Doin' What Comes Natur ` lly,'' an unbashedly sentimental favorite like `` Always'' or a complex love song like `` Let's Face the Music and Dance `` He was a folk singer and he was able to absorb whatever was happening in the street and bring it out, even more than <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jablonski </PERSON>, a good friend of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s and the author of several books on American theater composers. `` He was an ordinary man who was able to write songs. That's why he appealed so much to people. `` But he also made a point of not being a well-educated musician. He was a born musician, which is a hard thing to be. So he could be more sophisticated that he ever thought he was.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> also was a shrewd businessman. He was a charter member and served on the first board of directors for <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, which collects songwriting royalties. Before 1920, he had formed his own music publishing company which published all of his music. And at the time of his death, he was still co-owner of the Music Box Theater, a Broadway theater he built in 1921. As late as two years ago, he would call up the box office at the Music Box to see how the grosses were going. But it will be for his music that he will be remembered. `` I would think <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is the most admired songwriter <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has produced in this century _ and maybe ever,'' <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Platoons of would-be Rambos are shopping for exotic weaponry and fighting fashions, taking tutorials on world terrorism and swapping war stories at the 10th annual Soldiers of Fortune convention. At the start of the three-day gathering Friday, conventioneers decked out in berets, flak jackets and camouflage pants sat around the pool of the Sahara Hotel amid bikini-clad sunbathers. Others rubbed shoulders with civilian gamblers at the bars and slot machines. An estimated 10,000 delegates could choose from seminars on such hot spots as <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, manufacturers' displays and a shooting competition at a desert range As usual, the big hit was the annual display of weapons and apparel designed especially for those spoiling for a fight. `` It features a lot of things your mother probably did n't want you to play with when you were growing up,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, exhibition director at the convention, which is put on by Soldier of Fortune magazine of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. The show, he said, is keyed to the interests of the `` professional adventurer.'' Elsewhere in the country, people are campaigning to rid the civilian populace of semiautomatic weapons. But in the hotel's main exhibition hall, convention-goers trooped to booths featuring the latest in rapid-fire armament. Street Sweeper Sales of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> touted a line of automatic weapons with a banner picturing an ominous looking weapon. `` The Street Sweeper _ Delivers 12 rounds in less than 3 Seconds,'' the sign said. `` Buy American _ It matters.'' Salesman <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON> said the featured firearm is used mainly for police work and by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law agencies against drug smugglers and dealers. Some Street Sweepers are used for `` self protection,'' <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON> said, adding it's `` like any gun. Each person has a different use for them.'' <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON> said his company sells only to licensed gun dealers. Several booths, including one set up by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, urged attendees to fight efforts at gun control. Posters, T-shirts and bumper stickers carried a similar theme. One poster pictured a man with a cache of guns and a message: `` Make all the laws you want _ you ai n't taking mine!'' Nearby was a stack of bumper stickers reading `` WAR _ <LOCATION> Mankind </LOCATION>'s oldest contact sport. Camouflage was the uniform of the day. Several booths offered `` camo'' clothing including pants, jackets, hats _ even bikini swimsuits and women's lingerie. Outside, a motor home sported a camouflage paint job. T-shirt slogans ran along the lines of `` Kill a Commie for Mommy,'' and `` I do n't dial 911'' next to a picture of a gun. One booth bristled with dozens of official-looking laminated ID cards, including Police, Press, <PERSON> Swat </PERSON> <PERSON> Team </PERSON>, Security and Ordained Minister. A sign read `` America is at Peace because the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is at War.'' Among the hundreds of books offered were a manual on the care and operation of the AK-47 assault rifle and a volume entitled, `` Armed and Female: 12 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women own guns. Should you?'' Some exhibitors were reluctant to talk to reporters. A salesman for Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Intratec </ORGANIZATION> referred questions to his home office when asked about the company's .22 - caliber Scorpion automatic CEP, Inc. of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was hawking videos on such subjects as terrorist weapons and making various explosives. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>'s Gun Shop of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, showcased a new bullet with enhanced destructive power. The promotional literature described it: `` On impact, a pre-cut, precision forged metal projectile opens into whirlpool-creating, chopping blades.'' Airpower Sabot Cannons of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, demonstrated an air-powered gun that's fired while resting on a person's shoulder. Potential ammunition included steel or lead balls, steel projectiles, bean bags, paint balls and water balloons. `` Kill it, capture it, mark it, rescue it, scare it, intimidate it, supress it, sink it,'' read the brochure.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators, meeting under the splendor of the snow-capped Rocky mountains, reached a major breakthrough Friday on a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons arsenals. They also neared completion of a separate accord that would open Soviet underground nuclear tests to on-site American inspection and vice versa, senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials reported. A Soviet official said a `` general framework'' for a pact had been nailed down, which if made final could end a deadlock on the ratification of 15-year-old test ban treaties. The breakthrough on strategic weapons came during an arms control session between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in a mountain lodge overlooking <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. There, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> informed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the Soviets had dropped their demand for completion of a treaty to limit space-based defenses _ Star Wars _ before a separate pact to slash long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines could be implemented. `` I am not aware of any statement like that in the past,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity. `` The Soviets have shifted,'' he said. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to yield to Soviet demands to trim its space-defense program, known popularly as `` Star Wars,'' completing a treaty to reduce strategic weapons 30 to 50 percent was improbable. Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> in 1987 fell apart over the dispute, which is known within the arms control community as `` linkage.'' The shift in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> position was announced this way by the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official at a briefing for reporters: `` In response to a question from Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said they had dropped their linkage between completing an agreement in START -LRB- Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -RRB- and achieving a defense-in-space accord.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official repeated the statement thrice for emphasis. He stressed a treaty to slash strategic weapons could be implemented even without an agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet defenses. `` This looks like a positive development,'' the official said. He stressed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intended to go ahead with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> launched by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The President's commitment to that program is very well-known,'' the official said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced the program in March 1983. From the outset the Soviets sought to stifle it. But since 1987 the Soviets had said they were willing to permit some Star Wars tests. The offer is under discussion at the talks in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>. A Soviet spokesman, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Malakhov </PERSON>, said there would be no Soviet response to the American comments before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> spoke at a joint news conference today. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in Saturday editions that the letter carried to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for an acceleration of meetings of foreign ministers aimed at a treaty on conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by the end of next year. The inspection agreement would send scores of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inspectors to the Soviet test site at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> to ensure that detonations that are part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons program are within legal limits. It would also bring Soviet inspectors to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test site in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Scientists from both countries have monitored some of each other's recent explosions as a test. The current ceiling under unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties is a force of 150 kilotons, or 150,000 tons of TNT. The bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> in 1945 exploded with a force now estimated at about 13,000 tons of TNT. The Soviet official, who briefed reporters on the daylong Baker-Shevardnadze talks on condition that he not be identified, said that the two sides still had to decide the range of the small blasts that could be excluded from inspection. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is to have all tests between 50 and 150 kilotons subject to inspection while the Soviets wanted to set the range between 75 and 150 kilotons. There would be no bar to underground explosions smaller than whatever floor is decided upon. Tests in the atmosphere and in the ocean are banned by a 1963 treaty. The new agreement could pave the way for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the 1974 and 1976 treaties, which critics had contended did not contain adequate safeguards against violations. In fact, former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused the Soviets in two reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of cheating _ charges the Soviets flatly denied. The agreement clears the way for American use of a new sophisticated technique that measures the speed of destruction of a coaxial cable in a vertical hole near the blast, the so-called CORRTEX technique. Until now, measurements have been undertaken with seismic methods, measuring the ground motion resulting from the blast _ just like measurements of earthquakes. The Soviet official said the agreement gives the two sides the option on which method to use and his government still prefers the seismic approach. `` The general framework has been agreed on,'' the Soviet official said. The other two tentative accords, announced during the lunch break, provides for advance notice of military exercises and an agreement in principle for `` trial verification'' of each other's stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons, according to the Soviet briefer Some of those arms, such as cruise missiles carried aboard submarines and surface warships, are hard to track. This has slowed completion of a treaty to slash stockpiles of bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent. The Soviet official said there were still differences over which weapons to expose to inspection. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was concentrating on Soviet mobile missiles, while the Soviets wanted to check on a broader range of arms and factories. Still, the headway on arms control reflected a generally good atmosphere. Not all went smoothly, though. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who also requested anonymity, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had complained to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> about `` tremendous increases'' in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> bloc weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Posing for pictures at the start of two days of talks, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> looked over a meadow with the snow-dusted <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> mountains just beyond. Two moose grazed in the sun-lit flats at the base of the peaks. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> joked that the animals had been chained to provide a bucolic backdrop. `` Yes, I notice that the moose are tied,'' the Soviet minister replied. After the two men left the terrace, the moose bolted into the woods at the approach of television cameramen. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in a lakeside lodge, said he hoped a new openness between the superpowers would lead to `` some steps that are unprecedented.'' The nuclear test agreement would fall into that category. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> shared in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s upbeat mood as the two spoke briefly to reporters. `` I would like especially to emphasize,'' he said, `` that it is high time for us to move from mutual understanding to mutual action.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are scheduled to meet through Sunday morning, when, after a fishing expedition, they will fly on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to attend the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which opens on Monday with a speech by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> addresses the assembly on Tuesday. The talks here were also designed to narrow a time frame for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sometime next year. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, asked to comment on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration statements that a summit would be held sometime next year, said, `` We'll be discussing this today.''

<TEXT>
 A defense witness admitted she received a teddy bear from <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> before testifying that she saw a motorcycle policeman drag the actress from a car and kick her. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> explained she handed <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> a `` <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> G'Bear </PERSON>,'' replete with satin nightgown, as a gift for Ms. <PERSON> Perick </PERSON>'s son. Ms. <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> was the first witness in the cop-slapping trial to corroborate Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s story about her arrest. She said Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> made other offers during her two visits to the actress' house this week. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> `` offered me whatever I wanted,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> faces a possible 18-month jail sentence if convicted of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container of alcohol in her car Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> does not deny slapping Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. But she insists she lashed out in self-defense after he cursed her and dragged her from her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> on June 14 when he spotted expired registration tags on the car. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> cited Ms. <PERSON> Perick </PERSON>'s remarks to imply that she stood to benefit by buttressing Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> asked Ms. <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> how she supported herself. `` When I work, I have income. When I do n't work, I do n't have income,'' she responded. Under further questioning, she began to explain that she had taken a mortgage on her home when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> broke in: `` I will help you.'' `` I'm sure you will,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> quipped to snickers from the packed <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> courthouse. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> why defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> invited her to Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s house on Tuesday, the day Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> took the witness stand. `` I guess to review the case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> replied. `` We had nothing else to speak -LRB- of -RRB-,'' she said. <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said he planned to call up to four more witnesses for the defense before wrapping up his case. But he conceded Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> likely would be convicted of driving without a valid license, a misdemeanor.

<DATELINE>FOLLY BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricane Hugo's six-hour blast left <LOCATION> Folly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> unrecognizable even to its mayor. Up the coast, the storm's wake left two other barrier islands cut off, and sliced another in two. Folly Beach, the town and island just south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, virtually lost its entire beachfront row of homes. `` I do n't know where we are,'' Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Linville </PERSON> said during a tour of the area. `` All of my usual landmarks are gone.'' One missing dwelling was the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Restaurant, which had survived years of serious erosion that left it literally sitting atop pilings in the ocean, approachable only by foot bridge. After <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, all that remained was its red shingle roof. `` About 30 percent of the houses on the island are no longer habitable, if they're even here,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Folly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Linville </PERSON> estimated the damage at tens of millions of dollars and said hundreds of buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Most of the seaward houses in the town of 2,000 residents either were cracked open or without roofs or windows. Along the ocean, support poles for beach houses had nothing to support, their houses having been washed away by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 12 - to 17-foot tidal surge <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, about 50 feet from the ocean, looked like a dirt road, covered with sand and the debris of smashed beach houses. The storm showed that the destruction was often a game of chance. One house was knocked off its foundation and with a wall missing. But a china cabinet remained standing as did two plates inside. Demolished houses spewed mattresses, clothes, and furniture along the beach. The Holiday Inn, which sits on a slab of concrete 50 feet from the ocean, seemed to weather the storm remarkably well despite its proximity to the ocean. Its upper floors remained intact even though the first floor was demolished. Farther up the coast, two barrier islands _ <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the Isle of Palms _ were cut off from land because the storm knocked out its only link _ the swing-span <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON>. On the Isle of Palms, which hosts the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Clay Court Tennis Championships, the hurricane ripped the fishing pier out of the water and destroyed million-dollar waterfront homes. About 100 boats that had been docked at the Wild Dunes Marina were `` stacked up like cordwood'' across the marina on <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON>, a state Wildlife and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> created a 100 - to 200-foot-wide channel of water through <LOCATION> Pawleys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, midway between <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, a pilot from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> who flew people to the coast to check their property `` There are now two <LOCATION> Pawleys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, if you will,'' Sellers said. Back on Folly Beach, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBani </PERSON> walked along the streets Friday afternoon carrying a small satchel and looking for a ride. While many other heeded evacaution orders before the storm, <PERSON> DuBani </PERSON> said he remained and partied with some other people in an ocean front house as <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> smashed ashore. `` It was incredible,'' he said. `` Everything was just floating by.'' <PERSON> DuBani </PERSON> said he left the house when it began breaking up, and walked across the street to a neighbor's house whose door had been blown open. `` I got scared and just grabbed my clothes. This is all I have left,'' he said, pointing to his pouch that contained a fishing pole, a can of beer, some swimming fins, a snorkel, several shirts and a few pairs of pants. `` Thinking about heading to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>,'' he said before hitching a ride out of town with a blonde woman in a sports car. But <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetric </PERSON> was determined to stay. `` Going to rebuild,'' he said of his demolished house. `` I pay taxes, and, if I pay taxes, I should have full use of my property.''

<HEAD>Former HUD Head to Have Cameras Banned from Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will exercise his right to ban cameras from his forced congressional testimony on scandals at the agency during his eight-year tenure. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorney on Friday also gave his strongest indication yet that the former secretary might refuse to answer some questions when he appears before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Tuesday. But attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said no thought was being given to ignoring the subpoena. `` That's not even in the realm of possibilities,'' said <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>. `` We'll be there.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was subpoenaed to testify after he refused to appear voluntarily last week. House rules allow subpoenaed witnesses to ban television cameras, still photographers and microphones from the hearing room. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s decision, expressed in a letter from <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> to the subcommittee, is the latest maneuver in what has become an increasingly hostile interaction between the panel and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing is reviewing allegations of fraud, mismanagement and cronyism at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. It wants to ask <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> about a number of controversial decisions and testimony that contradicts a sworn account the former secretary gave in May. Chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., characterized <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> as `` deceitful'' after he declined to testify last week <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> needed more time to prepare his testimony. <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said he believed that televising the hearings has contributed `` to an atmosphere that totally departed from fairness and objectivity.'' `` I am deeply committed to restoring decency and a sense of somberness in the process. And frankly, I want very much to decrease the atmosphere for what I consider unfounded but damaging references made about my client under the rubric of the free speech and debate clause,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. That clause provides that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may not be sued for anything they say during official proceedings. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, the subcommittee's chief counsel, said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> had expected the decision. `` Chairman <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> believes that it is not in the best interests of Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and is a disservice to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who have a right to know what happened during Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eight-year tenure at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said. Lantos most likely will allow the use cameras and microphones at the conclusion of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s testimony and offer a summation of the hearing, <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Key Senators Reach Compromise on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Key Senate clean air sponsors say they've reached a political compromise on acid rain that would benefit seven states that cleaned up emissions from coal-fired power plants <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., on Friday predicted their agreement would win support for clean air legislation The compromise is not included in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air plan, which is being considered by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. Both the administration and <PERSON> Baucus-Mitchell </PERSON> plans are designed to reduce the major component of acid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10 million tons _ and prevent any growth of emissions after the reductions are achieved. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill would require the reduction by the end of the year 2000 and the Mitchell-Baucus requires the improvement by Jan. 1, 2000. The agreement would exempt states from making further sulfur dioxide reductions through the start of 2000, if more than one half of their coal-fired power plants utilize pollution-reducing equipment called scrubbers. The provision would benefit <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, according to a list handed out by the senators. Acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and is carried hundreds of miles before raining down to earth. Acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams, damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs.

<NOTE>Illegal Decisions to Deny Treatment to Handicapped Said to Persist</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some doctors and hospitals illegally deny lifesaving treatment to infants born with severe physical and mental disabilities, says a government report. Decisions to withhold medical treatment, food and fluids to these disabled children in many instances occur with the cooperation of federal, state and local government agencies, despite a federal law prohibiting the practice, concluded the study released Friday. The 500-page report, `` Medical Discrimination Against Children with Disabilities,'' was released by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. The study's conclusions are based on anecdotal evidence, an examination of how hospital infant-care review committees and child protection agencies have enforced the law, and a national random survey of physician attitudes published late last year. In that survey, 75 percent of the responding physicians said they would be neutral or would discourage surgery for infants with spina bifida and another severe disability, hydrocephalus. The study concludes that decisions to deny such treatment often are not made on the basis of medical judgments and are discriminatory.

 The magic tricks, dazzling and amazing, flow one into the next. A mime troupe sparks children's laughter, while a basketball game on unicycles draws chortles from adults. Walking through a green light that appears to have no ramp beneath it, <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> opened the first of 32 performances at Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, a show as lavish in constuming and lighting as those the late <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> used to do. <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> are swallowed by two robots helped by putty-colored people with big insect heads. A woman arrives, lifts her arms and disappears. Another woman is seen swimming in a tank. A cloth is thrown over the tank and when it's removed, a white tiger is in there and the audience hears a tape-recorded roar. That all takes place in the first few minutes of the show, and <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> are n't taking time to milk the applause. Their show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the next dazzlement. Women assistants suffer everything but being sawed in half. One lies in a long box which is pushed together like an accordion. Another swings on a swing from her waist up. Her skirt, legs and feet dance out on stage separately. Another gets into a Japanese box, which then is folded into a tiny square box. Unfolded into a large rectangle again, she emerges from it. Another is balanced on a spike, which seems then to skewer her. The charming <PERSON> Mummenschanz </PERSON> mime troupe from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> was a special favorite with children. A big green `` clam'' licks its lips around a stuffed rabbit before gobbling it up. Two men wearing putty masks made countless shapes with them, one pulling a pieces of the `` face'' out like chewing gum and whacking it back onto himself. The unicycle basketball teams are the King Charles Troupe, formed in the 1960s as a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> unicycle club. There are a couple of Las Vegas-style numbers by dancers wearing not much. The animals are beautiful. A white car drives on stage _ as <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> used to do _ bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> on his back, they're pulled into the air.

<TEXT>
 Ravaged by two decades of war and bloody revolution, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> now faces a drought that is expected to cut rice and fish cultivation by 25 percent and threaten many with starvation. A lack of local government to provide social services or otherwise help people makes the prospects for this nation of 8 million appear even bleaker. `` If the war wo n't kill you then you might die because of no water,'' said <PERSON> Treang </PERSON> <PERSON> Suon </PERSON>, a 37-year-old mother of four from Veal village in the <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> province, 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. `` And there is no government to help us along.'' Interviews with peasants, government officials, teachers and Western aid officials in the provinces of <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kampong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chhnang </LOCATION> gave a dark picture of the future for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The country appears poised to slide into a new phase of civil conflict now that the Vietnamese, this nation's occupiers for the last decade, say they will withdraw the last of their troops by Tuesday. Fighting between <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government troops and guerrillas from the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> resistance group already is intensifying in <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION>. A Western doctor in <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> said his hospital has seen a twofold increase in gunshot wounds over the past two months. `` Now we average about five a day,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are moving about very freely and the peasants are scared.'' The economy, too, is in deep trouble. Fish cultivation and timber production have fallen in <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> for two straight years. Due to the late and light rains this year, production of rice, the staple crop for the whole country, also is sure to fall. Three decades of peace ended in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1970 when a military coup ousted Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, dragging <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into the Vietnam War. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> took power in 1975 and killed hundreds of thousands of people under their radical brand of agrarian communism. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded the country in December 1978 and installed a pro-Hanoi regime in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. A resistance coalition led by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has been battling the Vietnamese and Cambodian government troops. If the economy worsens, the government will lose legitimacy, making its battle against the resistance front that much harder. The biggest loser will be <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s people. Time was when the Moslem people of <PERSON> Ro </PERSON> <PERSON> Leap </PERSON> village took the half-day walk over palm-lined paths and verdant paddies to <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sap </ORGANIZATION> to fish the once-bountiful waters. But now there is a drought, and bands of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas would make a trip too risky. `` We buy our fish now and only eat it on special occasions,'' said <PERSON> Ty </PERSON> <PERSON> Chouk </PERSON>, a 37-year-old farmer. `` We used to fish everyday.'' The catch in <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> province fell 41 percent between 1987 and 1988 to 4,120 metric tons, according to <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Heang </PERSON>, vice chief of the provincial committee. Another drop in 1989 is expected, government officials said. They still fish in nearby Veal village, but the residents no longer wander into the forest near Ro Leap to cut hardwood timber and bamboo for their homes. Landmines laid by the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> have blown up too many people. `` The folks near the lake do n't come up here anymore,'' <PERSON> Ty </PERSON> <PERSON> Chouk </PERSON> said. `` Only we know where the government mines are because we laid them in the ground. Other villages are too scared to risk their lives. Even we do n't go into the high areas anymore. That belongs to the Pol Pot people and their mines.'' Timber cultivation also fell in <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> between 1987 and 1988, dropping 16 percent to 5,000 cubic meters, <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Heang </PERSON> said. Bad weather has been another problem. Scarce rain pushed rice planting back from May until August, raising doubts as to whether the peasants around <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> would be able to plant a second crop of rice. `` My family will go hungry this year,'' said Mrs. Suon, spitting a red wad of beetlenut juice in the dirt. `` We ca n't live only on coconuts and onions, we must have rice.'' Another blow to agriculture has been the government's policy to forcibly conscript many young men. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poen </LOCATION>, a 43-year-old father of four, had his two sons taken away by the military. `` They were rounded up after a movie show,'' he said. `` It is good that they are serving the country but I need them, too, to farm the fields. I had to drop some land this year and am farming less. So we will have too little to eat.'' <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Heang </PERSON> estimated that rice cultivation in <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION> would fall between 12 percent and 25 percent. `` If the weather does n't get better the people could starve,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> official said he believed nationwide production would probably fall 25 percent. Yet another problem is the lack of local administration to help people deal with the crisis. At Veal village, which is responsible for eight communes holding about 1,500 people, the local government office consists of a ramshackle two-story house. Three rooms open onto a courtyard shaded by coconut trees. Freshly painted signs, `` Justice,'' `` Administration'' and `` Economy'' hang from the rooms. `` These are our departments,'' says <PERSON> Hem </PERSON> <PERSON> Pheach </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official. The rooms contain no chairs or tables. There is no paper, no phone. In one room, a chicken clucks in a corner, searching for food. `` We lack some materials,'' Hem says quietly, `` then maybe we can get on with our job.''

 Thousands of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> residents remained at the mercy of the elements nearly a week after Hurricane Hugo destroyed their homes and communities. Officials in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> complained Friday that while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> readily flew in troops to stop the looting and restore order, disaster relief was slow in coming. Tens of thousands of people remained in shelters or were roughing it wherever they could. `` I think the governor was wrong in telling the people the military was coming without telling them -LRB- when -RRB- food was coming, water was coming,'' said territorial Sen. <PERSON> Lilliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Belardo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and a group of congressmen were to begin a two-day fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> today. A congressional aide said the lawmakers planned to bring 20 cases of baby formula, 30 chain saws and 2,100 transistor radios. The congressmen, led by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, D.-Calif., also will consider special aid requests by local officials The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> obtained authority Friday from <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> to order <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals to enforce all laws on the islands and to prosecute any looters, officials said. Officials say at least 27 people died when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> steamrolled through <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Sunday before hitting the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> on Thursday, where it left 11 dead. Losses were estimated in the billions of dollars. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday declared the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> a disaster area and ordered 1,200 troops, mostly military police, to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in part to stop widespread looting. There were no reports of looting Friday, but virtually every store in <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, appeared to have been cleaned out. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that some of its members took part in the looting, and several witnesses said some police also were involved. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left homeless more than 45,000 people _ about 90 percent of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>'s population. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, is the main island in the group that includes St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said damage was tentatively estimated at $ 4 billion. `` The island is almost a total disaster,'' he said in a radio broadcast. He appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the police and other public employees to return to work in full force despite the continued chaos on the island. He said the National Guard was operating at 40 percent strength and the police at 80 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Belardo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said she and four other senators met with Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> on Friday to find out when people can expect relief supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>, complained that the army failed to promptly fly in food, clothes, bedding and medicine. `` Here we are, and this is what I have,'' she said, pointing to some old clothes piled on a table and the floor of an office. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said federal disaster specialists arrived on St. Croix Tuesday but were unable to request immediate help because of communications problems. He said the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> needs `` everything from wrenches to chain saws to medical supplies.'' In <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, 70 percent of the island's 3.3. million residents remained without running water and 20,000 were still housed in shelters Large parts of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, the capital, and several towns in the northeast also remained without power, officials said. Hundreds of residents in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> stood in long lines waiting for water, ice and gasoline. When Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> arrived in the northern coastal town of <LOCATION> Canovanas </LOCATION> on Friday to inspect local shelters, angry residents complained they had received no govenment aid since the storm. `` We're all in the street. We do n't have any food, water or light. Our houses blew away,'' resident <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> told the governor. In the British colony of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said 30 percent of the homes will have to be rebuilt and another 30 percent will need extensive repairs. He said about 3,000 of the island's 12,500 residents were left homeless. While the 39-square-mile island still lacked power, some water and phone service was being restored, he said.

 The `` greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and last year's record-setting <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, some meteorologists say. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> blasted the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people. Just before <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> struck the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast, its pressure was measured at 940 millibars. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> last year, killing 300 and causing $ 2 billion damage. It was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> of the meteorology department at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, `` the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book `` Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s. He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> demonstrated the effect of warm <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` You'll get worse hurricanes if the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> is warmer,'' he said. `` And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will have stronger hurricanes.'' <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s strength _ and future <ORGANIZATION> Gilberts </ORGANIZATION> will be even stronger. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was so strong that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the national hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five the highest. The computer models <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked. It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> could somehow remain cooler. But he said that is unlikley. `` That's not what the models are showing,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` And that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''

<HEAD>World Conservative Parties Back Reform in East Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of conservative political parties from around the world said today the failure of socialism is evident and that they will support East Bloc reformers. `` The disintegration and decay of socialism as an idea and as an economic and political system is one of the most important developments in our world today,'' said a statement issued at the end of a three-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The union, formed in 1983, includes right-of-center parties from 26 countries and holds a meeting of party leaders every two years. Figures who attended the conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, hosted by Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, included Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and party leaders from countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region _ most of them in the opposition. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose speeches at the conference stressed the need to keep defenses strong and avoid complacency, spent today touring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which is home to about 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. The vice president will hold meetings with <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and other Japanese leaders Monday and Tuesday before flying to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Although delegates from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, on the frontier with the rapidly changing countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, called for a program of comprehensive aid to East Bloc reformers, the final conference document did not go so far. `` Only the societies that free themselves totally of the structures, rigidities and follies of socialism will in the longer run be able to share in the new prosperity of the future,'' it said. `` We therefore resolve to give support to all those who accept these challenges and who will embark upon a program of peaceful change towards freedom and democracy,'' the statement said. It said the West should not subsidize failed socialist economies, and that increased debt would only hinder progress toward free-market economies. `` However, the West must be prepared to give financial incentives which support real changes in these economies, introducing market economy and other structural reforms,'' it said. The statement also called for more joint East-West business ventures. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, at a news conference Friday before she left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and talks with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said she did not think the stage was set for something like the Marshall Plan, the massive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program that helped Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> recover from World War II. But she said West European countries, individually and in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, had taken steps to aid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and that she expected the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> eventually to help. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> and new chairman of the organization of conservatives, said the group was proposing programs to assist advocates of change in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. While the conference statement praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, it said there was no guarantee he would succeed. `` We therefore reaffirm our absolute determination to maintain adequate defenses and our continuing support for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, which has kept the peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for over 40 years.'' The statement noted, however, that some communist leaders have recognized a link between economic freedom and political freedom and said this showed a commitment to reform. `` We are convinced that this new approach will diminish mistrust, thus leading to marked improvement in East-West relations,'' it said.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Argue For Asylum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Chinese students seeking asylum testified that a return to their homeland would mean a life as bleak as their families endured during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cultural Revolution. The students, who fled to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after leading an anti-government protest in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following the June crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, were emotional Friday during the first day of their hearing. Asked through a Cantonese translator if she would be willing to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> replied, `` I would rather die.'' The 27-year-old linguistics student testified about her father's imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution and her own fears that her political activity while studying in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would lead her to the same fate `` If we return, it's like a death row. My life will be like my father's and many others','' she said. Her fiance, <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jian </PERSON> <PERSON> Guang </PERSON>, said when his father died last July, he was afraid to return for the funeral. `` I would never return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because if I return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, they know my name, they will imprison me,'' he said. The students were led handcuffed into the court, but federal Immigration Judge <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornbach </PERSON> ordered the handcuffs removed. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had no particular position on the matter but filed a brief containing a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommendation that asylum not be granted because the students had n't proved they face persecution if they return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> helped organize and publicize a rally in <LOCATION> Toyko </LOCATION> on June 4, just after <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops began their assault on student protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. They also signed a petition protesting the action. Immediately afterward they began receiving threatening phone calls warning them that their demonstration, photographed by Chinese embassy officials, could lead them into trouble. Both testified Friday that they believed the calls came from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. They fled through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and have been seeking political asylum since arriving in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in August. Their attorney, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, said there has been only one other case in which a Chinese person came into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the crackdown to seek asylum. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said the case could set a precedent for other Chinese residents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who have spoken out against the current regime in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government estimates there are 73,000 Chinese students in the country. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided in June to allow students who were in the country at the time of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown to remain here. <ORGANIZATION> Hornbach </ORGANIZATION> continued the hearing until Sept. 29 and advised <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> to seek <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON>'s release from custody so she could seek medical treatment for ulcer-like symptoms. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchert </PERSON>, regional <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director, said <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> would be examined by a doctor today. She was being held at a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> women's detention facility.

 Fighting between the government and guerrillas intensified as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout deadline neared, but <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said today the resistance and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government had agreed to more peace talks. Vietnamese soldiers, meanwhile, received gifts and were serenaded at a farewell ceremony. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> said that after meetings in the past two weeks, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s three main guerrilla factions and Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> agreed to future talks after negotiations failed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last month. The time and place for the talks had yet to be fixed, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said at a news conference. There was no immediate comment from the guerrillas or the Cambodian government. However, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the leader of a coalition of guerrillas, had suggested that the meeting be held in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` We can not let the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> fighting go on any longer. If a civil war happens <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> will have to bear a greater burden of Cambodian refugees,'' he said. Already about 300,000 refugees live along the Cambodian-Thai border. A Soviet military adviser was quoted today as saying the Cambodian government and <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have thrown their best troops into heavy fighting for a gem-rich town near the border. The Soviet adviser said <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> troops succeeded in controlling the ridge and mountains around the city of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> but that they had not taken the town, located about 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> and known for ruby mines in the area. The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of the town's residents had fled or been evacuated and that fighting was fierce. His remarks, made in Russian in an interview with an East European reporter, were made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The adviser said <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 196th Division, apparently its best, was fighting with the 302nd Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a force formed in 1978 to serve as bodyguards for high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders when tensions with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were mounting. Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has been supporting the communist government in <LOCATION> Pnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has backed the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who governed from 1975 until 1978 and tried to carry out an agrarian revolution that killed hundreds of thousands of people before the Vietnamese invaded. There was no way to immediately confirm the adviser's report. Friday, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Deputy Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Ke </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> said up to 450 <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were trying to carve out a `` liberated zone'' around <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, and had intensified 120mm mortar shelling, firing up to 2,000 rounds a day. The Cambodian resistance group, led militarily by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, has its bases near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. It receives the bulk of its arms via <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. For the past three days, festive gatherings have been held across <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> marking what <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says is the withdrawal of the last 26,000 troops it sent since invading in December 1979 to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Guerrillas say the pullout, which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> promises to complete by Tuesday, is a sham. Observers say they believe the movement is largely genuine. Crowds of villagers, holding placards reading `` Welcome, the withdrawal Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' applauded and cheered in unison after patriotic speeches by <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> and Vietnamese officials. Some Vietnamese officers were presented with gifts and leis of flowers. One officer was given a large portrait of the late Vietnamese leader <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> sitting with <PERSON> Tou </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuth </PERSON>, one of the founders of the Cambodian Communist Party. A band, dressed in dirty white uniforms, played throughout, cranking out off-key renditions of the national anthems of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Vietnamese soldiers interviewed during the festivities said they were looking forward to going home but that they were concerned for their future. `` I hope to go home and stay in the military,'' said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Son </PERSON>, from Can Tho province in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` But I am an enlisted man and my country wants to cut our armed forces.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it wants to cut the size of its military, which because of its expense, has contributed to the country's economic difficulties. Son, 22, said that if he ca n't stay in the army he will return to his village and farm. The withdrawal is to end <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s involvement in the decade-long war that left more than 25,000 Vietnamese soldiers dead and its economy in tatters. The guerrillas charge that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> actually is leaving its troops behind in various disguises. That is not possible, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliff </PERSON>, the American observer from the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a Philadelphia-based private group. `` It is just physically impossible for Vietnamese troops to stay in this country in the quantities that would be needed'' without being seen by the many foreign aid officials in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and on the Thai-Cambodian border, he said. `` I wo n't report that I have proof of a complete withdrawal, but we believe that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is withdrawing all its troops,'' said <PERSON> Bali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhagat </PERSON>, a former Indian foreign minister representing <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s governing party

 They gathered by the thousands in a high school stadium to pray and to cry, to comfort each other and to remember 20 young people who died when their school bus plunged into a water-filled pit. `` The emptiness that we feel will not be replaced again,'' said <PERSON> Sanjuanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, mayor of <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, the town of 3,700 where the accident occurred. `` A part of our lives has been taken away from us.'' `` We wish we could at this moment turn the clock back to avoid what happened, but we can not,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> told more than 10,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s stadium Friday. It's believed most of the victims, ranging in age from 12 to 18, drowned when a soft drink truck ran a stop sign and rammed the bus over a 40-foot cliff into the pit Thursday morning. At least 63 people were injured; three remained in critical condition late Friday. The bus was headed to the high school. Federal investigators said Friday night an initial investigation did not produce any evidence to support the claim of truck driver <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> that his brakes failed. `` Nothing to date shows any indication of a failure in the braking system,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member. But he added that the probe had just begun. Meanwhile, Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> assigned a team to study whether the state should revise bus safety laws and require guard rails around gravel pits and similar roadside hazards. There was no rail or fence around the pit in <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>. The bus had only one emergency exit _ the back door _ and rescuers said many of the students who died were trapped at the front of the vehicle. Drivers in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which lies along the Mexican border, drove with their headlights on Friday and flags were flown at half-staff. At the memorial service, which replaced a canceled football game, the mourners sat silently as the names of the dead were read. Some wept and consoled each other through the 90-minute service attended by more than 20 ministers and priests. <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>, 16, who said he escaped through a window in the bus but lost six friends, prayed on the field with his 14-year-old brother, <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON>, another survivor. <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON>, teary-eyed, said the stadium service made him feel better, although he still hurts `` because my friends died.'' <PERSON> Magdalee </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, 16, a Mission High junior, said she knew four of the students who died. `` I felt that I owed them something. I felt that it was best for me to come.'' <PERSON> Orfilinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, sophomore counselor at the school, said the service was helpful. `` It's a way of dealing with it and everybody feeling the same things together,'' she said. `` It will take more of this,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Sostenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Funerals and other memorial services will help the families and friends of victims and survivors to heal, said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, principal at Mission High. `` It's a way to release some of the grief and sadness that build up,'' he said. At least 14 funerals were scheduled for today. About 500 people attended the funeral Friday of 12-year-old <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>. Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> told them not to blame themselves or question why the victims died. `` It does n't help to ask why him or why her. Only God knows,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said in Spanish and English.

<HEAD>Three Nobel Academy Members Quit, Two Cite Rushdie Affair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three members of the academy that awards the Nobel Prize for literature have resigned, and two said they were unhappy that the body did not denounce <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threat against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The secretary of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sture </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, confirmed Thursday he received three letters of resignation but said they could not be accepted because the academy's 200-year-old rules stipulate that members are elected for life. Author <PERSON> Kerstin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON>, one of the three to resign from the 18-member body, told Swedish radio afterward, `` No human can, at least in our country, belong to an organization which she does not want to be part of. ... I guess they just can not admit that we quit.'' In any case, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the resignations will not affect the work of the academy. He declined further comment. The third resigning member, poet <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspenstrom </PERSON>, did not disclose his reasons but told Swedish television his motives differed from those of his two colleagues. The resignations came weeks before the announcement of the winner of the Nobel Prize for literature. The date is not set in advance but traditionally falls in October. In explaining her reasons for resigning, Ms. <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON> said, `` I am upset about the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair.'' She and another resigning colleague, former <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyllensten </PERSON>, stopped taking part in the academy's work in February. They said they were protesting because the academy refused to condemn explicitly the death threat issued Feb. 14 by the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> blasphemed Islam in his novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' a bestseller that stirred worldwide protests among Moslems. Several other Academy members have complained about the group's stand on the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> case but generally accepted its tradition of avoiding official statements on political issues Ms. <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON> said the three resigning members had not planned their action together. She said she had submitted a resignation now to let a substitute be elected. She also said the Academy was in need of renewal. `` Everybody realizes that it has come to a standstill,'' she said. The Academy statutes were written by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who founded the institution in 1786. It has awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize for literature since 1901.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bowed out suddenly after 14 years as operator of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons plant, marking the final breach between the company and the government over hazardous waste disposal. The move was announced late Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, one day after <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> sued the government over the dispute at the plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. The contractor maintained it was impossible to follow both its contract with DOE and the waste disposal rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The DOE has identified Rocky Flats as the most environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry because toxic chemicals contaminate an underground reservoir and threaten nearby city water supplies. Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, the energy secretary, said <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, Mass.-based scientific engineering firm, had been asked to replace <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. EG & amp; G officials will arrive at the plant Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Beall </PERSON> had agreed to change Rocky Flats' management `` in the best interest of both parties.'' Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, a critic of safety practices at the plant, warned that a management change would n't end state efforts to track possible waste violations at the plant. `` I am going to continue to hold the feet of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> and the operator to the fire to be sure that there is no endangerment to the citizens of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> from the operation of the Rocky Flats plant,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` I have been informed by <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G is an experienced operator and that there will be an orderly transition in which the current <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> employees will retain their jobs.'' The decision came so suddenly that plant employees were not notified of the change until after the 4 p.m. shift change Friday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Etchart </PERSON> said. It was announced over a public-address system late in the afternoon, <PERSON> Etchart </PERSON> said. EG & amp; G is the prime contractor for <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and is a contractor at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> test site and government facilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. EG & amp; G officials did n't respond to calls placed late Friday to the firm's headquarters and branch offices in several western states. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> sued the government Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, claiming conflicting federal rules require it to violate hazardous waste disposal laws at the plant. The same day, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> cited <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> for violating hazardous waste storage laws at Rocky Flats. The lawsuit named the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and asked the court to clarify the obligations of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and the government in running the plant. A week ago, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> threatened to close the plant unless the hazardous waste regulations were clarified. Later in the day, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials announced a plan to resolve the problems over the next year. But <PERSON> Beall </PERSON> said the assurances given by the government were inadequate to protect <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> employees against possible criminal prosecution for violating the environmental rules. The DOE's statement said <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>' current work force of 5,000 would not be affected by the change in management. Federal law prohibits storage of hazardous wastes at a production site for more than 90 days, but there is no federally approved disposal site or treatment process for Rocky Flats' wastes. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> has been stockpiling wastes at Rocky Flats since Idaho Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> refused to accept further shipments at a temporary storage site in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Some state legislators say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution must be amended to give states power that has been seized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of the Council on State Governments, here for a three-day conference, were scheduled to vote today on a proposal to float two constitutional amendments intended to return power to the states. One would have the courts settle disputes between state governments and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the other would allow states to initiate amendments to the Constitution. If the council, which consists of about 175 legislators, governors, attorneys general and state judges, decides to back the amendments, the proposal would be forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. If that 8,000-member group approves the proposed amendments, members could begin seeking congressional approval in early 1990, he said. `` This is where it really starts moving,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronoff </PERSON>, a member of the council, said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, chairman of the council's executive committee, said he expects the proposed amendments to win approval easily from the council. `` I have n't heard of any opposition,'' he said A resolution approved Friday by the council says the changes are needed because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has intruded on state and local government powers by requiring states to offer certain programs without providing federal funds to pay for them. <PERSON> Aronoff </PERSON>, a Republican, said an amendment calling on the courts to settle federal-state disputes is needed because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled such disputes are purely political and are n't court matters. The proposed change in the process for amending the Constitution would let a three-fourths vote by states enact constitutional amendments. Those amendments would take effect unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vetoed them within two years. Currently, constitutional amendments can be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or put forth by a constitutional convention called by the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. In either case, amendments must be ratified by legislatures in three-fourths of the states.

<HEAD>Company Claims Diabetes Testing Breakthrough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A company says it has developed a painless way for diabetics to test their blood sugar level without having to prick their fingers for blood samples. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Biocontrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, said Friday that the company's new sensor uses electromagnetic technology to measure blood glucose levels. A sensor about the size of a cereal box should be ready for sale in about a year for use in doctors' offices, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> said. A home-use model about the size of a portable telephone should be available in two years. `` It's an intriguing development. If it works and does what they claim, it would be a very important contribution to the care of the patient with diabetes,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skyler </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION> and professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of the major things patients complain about is having to stick their fingers. It really does get to be a nuisance,'' he said. The new glucose sensor uses a wand to direct an electromagnetic beam through the skin, usually on the inside of the wrist, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> said. The beam is refracted by varying amounts of blood glucose and returns through the wand to the sensor's circuitry. The test takes two seconds, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> said, and the sensor provides a visual readout and a paper printout of the analysis. `` Such a device would be a major breakthrough in care for patients with diabetes,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Finegold </PERSON>, pediatrics endocrinologist at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and president of the western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Finegold </PERSON> said Type I diabetics, who are usually younger, are a minority of diabetics but require the most intensive treatment, including regular insulin injections. Pregnant women who are diabetic also are often in the Type I category, he said. Many physicians recommend Type I diabetics draw blood as often as four times daily to regulate their insulin dosage, <PERSON> Finegold </PERSON> said. Physicians often recommend that pregnant diabetics draw blood samples as many as seven times each day. More than 11 million Americans have diabetes, including more than 6.5 million who have been diagnosed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has estimated there are about 80 million diabetics in the world, according to the <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION>.

 Thousands of returning residents jammed highways to the devastated capital today after Christian army Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> accepted an Arab peace plan and fighting ebbed between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> troops and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces. Arab League envoy <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ibrahimi </PERSON>, entrusted with supervising the cease-fire, held contacts with army and militia commanders ahead of the first meeting later today of a proposed security committee to check any violations. Police said traditional front lines in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and in eastern mountains were `` generally quiet.'' A police spokesman said no major clashes had been reported since 10 p.m. Friday. `` Volleys of automatic gunfire can be heard every now and then, but no clashes in the military sense of the word,'' he said on condition of anonymity in line with standing regulations. Six months of fighting have killed 929 people, wounded 2,738 others and forced all but 150,000 people of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents to flee. Some sought refuge in safer areas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; others left the country altogether. Thousands of cars packed with families, suitcases, mattresses and blankets, jammed the main entrances to the city today. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatab </PERSON> said he, his wife and six children had been living in a room they rented in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> shortly after the latest round of fighting broke out March 8. `` Can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half a year. At certain times, we even had guests, relatives, neighbors and friends who also escaped with no where to go,'' <PERSON> Hatab </PERSON> said during a traffic jam on Ouzai, the southern entrance to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said he was returning to his home in the west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Nabaa </PERSON> because he believed the worst was over. <PERSON> Bahjat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, a local reporter in <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said lines of bumper-to-bumper cars crowded the northern entrance into the Christian heartland, which has been besieged by the Syrians and their Moslem allies for six months. `` It seems like all the entire <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> population is heading to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today,'' he said. He said scores of school buses also were rolling into the city apparently in preparation for the resumption of classes, which were suspended during the violence. `` It's like magic. Yesterday <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was a ghost city. Today it is bustling with life,'' <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> said. The security committee proposed under the peace plan would oversee implementation of a truce and the lifting of blockades imposed by the warring factions on each other's ports. It also would monitor maritime operations to assure no weapons shipments reach any of the Lebanese factions and set the stage for a political settlement of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The proposal calls for a meeting outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of the nation's parliament to recommend political reforms that would distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems Christians have dominated the government, judiciary and army since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, when they were thought to be the majority. Although no official census has been taken since 1932, Moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the 4 million population.

 Police blocked entrances to the capital today and strung barbed wire down a main street to stop an unauthorized march by anti-apartheid women's groups. Organizers said about 200 people were arrested. Police also used batons to clear black bystanders from <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s central square after scuffles broke out when right-wing whites in swastika-marked khaki uniforms began hustling blacks away from the site of an approved pro-apartheid rally One white right-winger and several blacks were arrested. The white extremists had received permission for their rally, but the women's planned march to government headquarters was banned because organizers refused to apply for a permit. The church where marchers were to meet was blocked off with rolls of barbed wire and guarded by scores of police officers. <PERSON> Zeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshongweni </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the march organizers, said about 200 people were arrested when they tried to assemble near the Union Buildings, the government headquarters which was the intended destination of the march. She said several people were injured when police used whips and dogs to disperse the crowd. Police detained <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergay </PERSON>, correspondent for the American television network <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, and several other journalists. Two buses, carrying <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and other blacks were chased through the streets by about 25 yellow police vehicles with sirens screaming and lights flashing. The police stopped the buses and ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the other occupants to leave <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` We came here peacefully but they are seeking violence,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is the same as any other country in the world. People ca n't break the law,'' said Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, standing among riot police behind the barbed wire that blocked the entrance to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alban </LOCATION>'s Anglican Cathedral A two-page notice was tacked to the door of the church, saying the government obtained a court order to stop a church service and the planned march to the Union Buildings. Two tear gas cannon trucks were parked nearby and hundreds of police lined the streets as the city center came to a standstill. The government banned the march because the organizers refused to ask for official permission, although women's groups said they had notified top government officials including President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and talked with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> traffic police. The government granted permission for two white supremacist groups to hold rallies two blocks from the cathedral because they had sought permission, officials said. At the first rally a banner called for the hanging of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and for the release from prison of <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, a white former policeman convicted early this year of killing seven black people in a shooting spree in the center of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. As the meeting ended, an altercation began when about 40 blacks tried to walk across the square where the rally was held and were stopped by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, who wear khaki uniforms and use swastika symbols. Police began herding away the blacks, who were flashing peace signs, and calling out to the whites, `` Peace, we all have the same blood.'' Suddenly police began running through the square, arresting blacks, letting their dogs loose and ordering reporters and everyone else from the area. It was not immediately clear whether the second right-wing rally would be allowed to go ahead. Organizers of the women's march said police blocked almost all traffic from the black townships around <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Traffic was backed up from <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s main thoroughfare to the freeway leading north from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> as police at roadblocks stopped and searched buses and cars filled with women and turned them away. About 30,000 women had been expected to defy the ban and try to march. About 200 women, most of them white, made their way to a park at the bottom of the ridge where the Union Buildings stand, but police arrived and ordered them to leave. They did not move quickly enough and several were arrested. A.R. <PERSON> Dawood </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said police hit some of the women with their batons. In obtaining a court order against the women's march, lawyers for the police had argued that the proximity of the right-wing rallies might lead to conflict. The women's groups said they had made extensive arrangements, including training parade marshals and setting up first-aid stations, to ensure their march was peaceful. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate neighborhoods, schools and health services.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers will take a new look at the world oil market over the weekend and decide whether they can increase production without sending crude prices tumbling. On the eve of their talks, some ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> seemed reluctant to tamper with the cartel's current output accord. The meeting was to begin today, but there was no indication of how long it would last. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON>, insisted upon arriving Friday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, `` There's no need to raise the -LRB- production -RRB- ceiling as long as the price objective is not met.'' <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, was the last to arrive in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the opening round of talks later in the day. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the Nigerian oil minister, said the price of oil `` could do a little bit more.'' `` We would like it to be 18 -LRB- dollars a barrel -RRB-,'' he told reporters at the hotel where the ministers are staying. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil chief, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>, said he favored a `` reasonable increase'' in the supply cap. He gave no specifics. The 13-nation cartel agreed in June on a production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day in the last six months of the year. Its price target was set at $ 18 a 42-gallon barrel. But analysts say heavy cheating by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> has helped kick supply up to 22 million barrels a day or more. Prices have remained fairly firm, but they are under <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target `` We still have to obtain the goal of $ 18 ... We should work on it,'' said <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shakshuki </PERSON> said, `` Eighteen dollars is better than increasing the quota.'' Prices have n't hit the $ 18 mark in the past three months. A basket of seven major crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 17.04 a barrel last week. It went above $ 18 last spring. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> oil, has been trading in the range of $ 19.50 to $ 20 a barrel. <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, predicted prices would slip from 50 cents to $ 1 a barrel if the cartel increased production without halting members' cheating. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers agreed in June to meet this month and decide whether to raise their output 500,000 barrels a day in the final three months of 1989. <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> said such an increase probably would translate into total production of 22.5 million barrels a day. The organization's secretary-general, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, said that 22 million barrels a day `` looks like the demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil in the fourth quarter'' of the year. In addition to the supply ceiling, the ministers' agenda included a discussion of the best way to set their quotas. Each country is assigned a daily quota. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> want bigger shares as do some other nations. To press their demands, the two countries have been pumping as much as double their daily quotas of about a million barrels each, analysts say. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil minister, told reporters that his pledge in June to rein in production had been `` conditional.'' `` If everybody sticks to the quota, fine. If anybody breaks it, the others have the same right,'' he said. The talks will officially be held by an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> monitoring panel made up of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The cartel other members _ <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> _ also were invited to attend.

 <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, the Russian cantor's son whose songs such as `` Cheek to Cheek,'' `` Easter Parade,'' `` White Christmas'' and `` God Bless America'' became the essence of American music, has died at age 101. `` He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all the many years,'' said composer-conductor <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Authors and Publishers. Of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s music, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said: `` It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul. `` It's the kind of finish of an era.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> died in his sleep at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> town house Friday afternoon, said his son-in-law, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. Asked if <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> had been ill, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said, `` No, he was 101 years old. ... He just fell asleep.'' An actor, singer, and songwriter, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> began his career in the early days of vaudeville and his songs for a time so dominated the stage and screen that the late composer, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, said: `` <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has no place in American music. He is American music.'' In a musical career that began with a job as a singing waiter, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wrote nearly 1,000 songs, from his first big hit, `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s Ragtime Band'' in 1911, to `` Puttin' on the Ritz,'' which was revived in 1983 by the Dutch singer <PERSON> Taco </PERSON> and was a hit on the rock charts. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was an immigrant Russian whose `` God Bless America'' became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. A Jew, his `` White Christmas'' and `` Easter Parade'' became Christian holiday traditions. `` American music was born at his piano,'' violinist <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s 100th birthday. So timeless was his appeal that his songs have become hits over and over, performed by such artists as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> records show 25 of his songs have topped the popular music charts. `` Blue Skies,'' a top hit when he penned it in 1926, reached the charts again 51 years later on an album by country singer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> played the piano by ear and never stopped making what he described as `` songs with heart.'' Even in his 90s, he talked of adding yet another musical to his credits, which included 19 stage musicals and 15 movie scores. At his peak, one smash followed another so readily that <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> once said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` ca n't help but write hits.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, along with 11 other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants, received a medal from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during the Statue of Liberty centennial celebrations in July 1986. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the actor was featured in the mammoth, flag-waving 1943 movie musical `` This is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' with songs from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Always a private man, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> declined to attend a Carnegie Hall gala, led by <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, to mark his 100th birthday on May 11, 1988. He was mourned by artists from across the spectrum of American music. `` <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter,'' said opera singer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, who also sings <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s songs. `` He was not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for melody and words that was precious.'' Composer <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON>, who wrote the 1969 Academy Award-winning song `` Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'' said, `` This is a great loss. But <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> has left us with the greatest legacy through his music.'' `` One could hear the dancing by just singing the lyrics,'' cabaret singer <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. `` He is perhaps the last of the giants _ and I think that's not a bad way to go.'' Actress and dancer <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> remembered <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> with a bit of song from his `` Cheek to Cheek,'' from the movie `` Top Hat.'' `` I'm in heaven,'' she sang, then broke off. `` It was like heaven,'' she said, describing the thrill of working with the likes of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>. The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes, which began in the World War I era with `` Watch Your Step,'' starring <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, and ran through such post-World War II hits as `` Annie Get Your Gun'' and `` Call Me Madam,'' both with <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman </PERSON>. `` A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wrote for the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every Ziegfeld extravaganza. In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> did the scores of `` Top Hat,'' starring <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>; `` Holiday Inn'' with <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>; `` Blue Skies''; `` Easter Parade''; `` White Christmas''; and `` There's No Business Like Show Business.'' His last Broadway show was `` Mr. President'' in 1962. His last song, `` An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966. His music-publishing empire earned him a fortune, which he readily shared with his country in wartime or with favorite causes. Since 1939 the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have been getting the royalties from `` God Bless America.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was awarded three medals for his works and a special <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> award for his contribution to the musical theater. He won a congressional medal for the acclaimed World War II musical, `` This is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' and the Academy Award for best song of 1942 for `` White Christmas.'' Explaining the seemingly endless gusher of successful songs, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said his tunes were merely rewrites of a handful of his best numbers. `` All good songwriters have no more than half a dozen good tunes in their systems, and if they have that many they're liberally blessed,'' he once said. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> never learned to read or write music and his piano playing was confined to the key of F sharp. He called songwriting hard work, but director <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> once recalled that <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> dashed off the first verse of `` Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better'' during a six-minute cab ride. Celebrity and wealth did n't seem to touch the shy personality of the intense, short man with wavy, slicked-down hair and dark glasses. He lived a simple life, centered on his songwriting and his family _ his late wife, <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, and their three daughters. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was brought up in poverty amid the immigrant swarm on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side. Born <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baline </ORGANIZATION> on May 11, 1888, he was 5 when his family emigrated from <LOCATION> Temun </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. He was one of eight children and acquired his earliest musical education from his father, a cantor. But his father's death put an end to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s formal education and, at age 8, he went from the second grade to the streets to earn a living. Known as <PERSON> Izzy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> sold newspapers, guided a blind, singing beggar and worked in vaudeville. In 1907, he wrote the words to his first song, `` Marie of Sunny <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'' in collaboration with the piano player at the <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> bar where he worked as a singing waiter. The song earned him 37 cents in royalties and a new name _ the sheet music cover erroneously credited the words to `` I. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' In 1911, at the age of 23, he was contributing songs to the Ziegfeld Follies. His `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s Ragtime Band'' with its `` ragged meter'' ushered jazz onto the popular scene and established <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as a master of Tin Pan Alley. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s marriage to <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> the following year ended after six months when his bride died of typhoid contracted during their honeymoon in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. In his grief, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> composed `` When I Lost You.'' His marriage in 1926 to <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> followed one of the most widely reported courtships of the decade. His wife's father, a prominent Roman Catholic layman and head of <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had opposed the union. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s wife died of a stroke at age 85 in July 1988. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is survived by his three daughters, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Services will be private, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartgrove </PERSON>, evening manager at the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> funeral home in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility today for the parcel bombing death of the owner of a fish store in this northern city and said it had mistaken the man for a policeman. In a statement published in the radical Basque newspaper Egin, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> said the killing Sept. 12 was `` an irreparable error and mistake'' and apologized to the victim's family. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> claimed the bomb was intended for a policeman who used the name of the dead man as a cover, but added: `` The sole responsibility is ours for this death.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Reina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesonera </PERSON> died of injuries suffered when a parcel he received in the mail exploded as he tried to open it, police said. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> seeks independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the three-province northern Basque region. In its 21-year campaign of violence, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, including 13 so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> recently claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb that killed a prison guard's mother Aug. 11 and for another parcel bomb sent to a Basque businessman Sept. 5 that was detected and safely detonated.

 Police have arrested a young man in connection with the fatal shooting of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, father of track star <PERSON> Zola </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, officers said today. Police said they found a shotgun and pickup truck which were missing from <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'s farmhouse when they arrested the 24-year-old man Friday night in <LOCATION> Welkom </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of the farm near <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>. Police did not identify the man, but the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said he was expected to appear in court Monday on a charge of murder. Newspapers said today that police had been seeking a young man who had been doing construction work on the farm, where <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'s body was found Friday.

<HEAD>Black Box Confirms Bomb on UTA Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Analysis of the black box retrieved from the wreckage of a French airliner confirmed that explosives blew the plane apart above the <LOCATION> Tenere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, killing all 171 people aboard, the government said today. Examination of the DC-10's flight data and voice recorder `` show that the flight proceeded in a normal manner until a total interruption, indicating an in-flight explosion,'' said a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement signals the start of an intensive search for the individual or group responsible for the bombing Tuesday of <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 772 en route from <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Police are examining the plane's passenger list for suspects, concentrating on nine people who got off in the <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, the plane's last stop before it exploded over the desert in eastern <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>. Investigators now will attempt to determine the precise nature of the explosive, where it was located on the aircraft and, most importantly, how it got on board. The pro-Iranian, Shiite Moslem group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, claimed responsiblity for the crash in telephone calls in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Officials said they could not authenticate the claim. The French news agency Agence France-Presse, quoting an unidentifed source at the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that authorities would focus their manhunt among the `` Shiite network'' in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Ash-Shiraa, a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> weekly, quoted Islamic militants loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> earlier this week as charging <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with reneging on a 1988 deal that resulted in the release of three French hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The newspaper said the militants were planning attacks on French interests in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> continues to deny making any deal for the hostages, beyond agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, recurring reports in the French press detail a deal in which <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> secured release of the hostages by agreeing to free <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, a pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorist serving a life sentence for attempting to murder former Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Shahpour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1980. The French news magazine <ORGANIZATION> L'Express </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> agents were trying to dismantle Islamic terrorist cells based in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> colonies. French officials denied portions of the L'Express article that indicated officials in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> had prior knowledge of a possible terrorist attack. French soldiers and military doctors working at the wreckage site were to begin airlifting the bodies of victims to <LOCATION> Agadez </LOCATION>, a village in central <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, and then on to the capital <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION> for identification, French military sources in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> said. Rugged desert conditions and temperatures of up to 113 have hampered rescue work.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today visited a maximum security prison for Mafia criminals, blessing the inmates and urging them to break free from their `` moral chains.'' The pope, who is on a three-day tour of <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION>, said he was a `` brother among brothers'' with the 150 convicts housed in the 15th century fortress prison that sits atop this medieval hill town. Known as the Fortezza -LRB- fort -RRB-, the prison was a castle begun by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brienne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, in 1343 and completed by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> the Magnificent in 1472. It has been used as a prison since 1848. Prison officials said most of the inmates were convicted of belonging to organized crime syndicates such as the Sicilian Mafia, <ORGANIZATION> Neapolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camorra </ORGANIZATION> and Calabrian ` ndrangheta Many were convicted of murder, and 15 are serving life sentences. The inmates clapped and sang as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> entered the prison courtyard. The area, enclosed by iron bars, normally serves as space for the inmates to play sports. Many prisoners bowed and kissed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s ring as he walked down the carpeted aisle and patted them on the head. `` Here I am among you, brother among brothers,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, `` for a visit looked forward to not only by you, but also by me for the affection that I bring you, to people who wish to reconcile themselves with society and find a new place to collaborate constructively for the common good.'' `` There is a liberation of physical chains, which for human beings certainly has great importance, as you can testify. But there is also ... a liberation from moral chains.'' The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said he was praying that the inmates show `` perseverance in your desire to collaborate in the construction of a free and just society.'' Before the pope spoke, a 26-year-old murder convict gave the pope a welcoming speech. `` Your salute and your blessing are very important for making us accept ourselves and making us accepted by the whole community,'' said <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Morano </PERSON>, serving a 21-year sentence for murder in <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION>. `` This meeting is a turning point of redemption for all of us.'' It was the third time <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has visited an Italian prison. In December 1983, he went to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s Rebibbia prison to forgive <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Agca </PERSON>, the Turkish gunman who shot him in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square in 1981. The pope has also visited the prison in <LOCATION> Civitavecchia </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The pope celebrated Mass in <LOCATION> Voleterra </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> dei Priori, bordered by medieval mansions, before heading for nearby <LOCATION> Lucca </LOCATION>. On Sunday he will visit <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Opposition Journalist Picked to Head State Media Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> today named an opposition journalist and specialist in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs to head the committee that controls state media, the official news agency announced. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON>, 57, a Solidarity activist and former political prisoner, will take over the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from the former longtime government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> agency said. The appointment is considered one of the most important for the East bloc's first government not led by Communists, removing control of the mass media from the Communist Party for the first time since World War II. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has promised that the state-owned mass media will become pluralistic and honest. `` The government wants to tell the truth and enable freedom of speech for all sections of public opinion. The right of access to radio and television must be equal to all,'' he said in unveiling his government to parliament earlier this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Mazowiecki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, installed Sept. 12, includes four Communists among its 24 members. The head of radio and television was the biggest remaining question mark of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government. The post will not retain Cabinet status, reflecting the new government's view that there should be nothing like an `` information minister'' shaping public opinion. `` This change is not just a replacement at the post of chairman, but it is an issue of credibility, and that is why it is so significant for the new government,'' said <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON>, a Solidarity senator from <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> who negotiated mass media reforms during `` round-table'' negotiations this year. <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> native, has no significant experience in broadcasting, but he is respected as a journalist and known for his admiration of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of perestroika and glasnost, or economic restructuring and openness. Like <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and thousands of other Solidarity activists, <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> was jailed after the 1981 martial-law crackdown on Solidarity. The Communist Party reversed itself this year and agreed to reinstate Solidarity's legal status. Solidarity then scored a landslide victory in June parliamentary elections, enabling it to form a coalition and take control of the government. <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> has published many articles both in the state-sanctioned and underground press about the changes taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He is also a translator of Russian literature. Urban, whom <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> replaces, was the chief defender of Communist policies as government spokesman from 1981 until this year.

 College students are smart enough to tell a spoof of Cliff's Notes from the real thing _ especially because the parody publication is labeled `` satire'' five times on the cover _ a court said. The explanation, released Friday by the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, gives the background for the court's Sept. 5 decision to let <ORGANIZATION> Spy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> sell its send-up of Cliff's student guide to classic literature. The ruling overturns a lower court order issued at the request of Cliff's <ORGANIZATION> Notes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which sued the Spy Notes publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Bantam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, over the satire. The publisher complained that Spy Notes _ which pokes fun at two novels popular with the yuppie set _ looks too much like the slender Cliff's pamphlets students have been using for years to crib comments for book reports. Spy Notes gives humorous plot summaries, commentary and questions for review on the contemporary novel `` Bright Lights, Big City'' by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> and `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' a short story collection by <PERSON> Tama </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowitz </PERSON>. It includes the Novel-O-Matic, a slide rule-like device so readers can create their own 1980s novels. The three-judge appeals panel wrote: `` We conclude that the parody cover of Spy Notes, although it surely conjures up the original and goes to great lengths to use some of the identical colors and aspects of the cover design of Cliff's Notes, raises only a slight risk of consumer confusion that is outweighed by the public interest in free expression.'' The judges noted that the cover of Spy Notes carries the words `` a satire'' five times in bright red letters on the front cover and four times on the back. They also said that a substantial portion of Spy Notes' potential audience, college students or college-educated adults, overlaps with <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>'s Notes' audience. `` As a result, the name ` Spy' in the title, the notation, ` A Spy Book' emblazoned on the cover of Spy Notes and the use of a prepack marketing device prominently displaying the ` Spy' name should alert the buyer that Spy Notes is a parody of some sort, or at least, that it is not the same product as <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>'s Notes,'' the judges said. Doubleday spokeswoman <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Deval </PERSON> said Spy Notes would be on sale in two weeks.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied today it was involved in two bomb blasts in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in July, and Tehran-supported terrorists vowed to avenge <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s execution of 16 Shiite Moslems convicted of setting the explosions. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as urging Moslems around the world to `` break their silence over these atrocities'' by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s royal rulers. A statement from the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said the executions were `` a terrorist act ... The deep grudge which rules the actions of the terrorist pagan regime ... will be a motive for avenging the blood of the oppressed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or the Party of God, is the pro-Iranian umbrella group thought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. A Pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims were wounded in the bombings on July 10 near the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, Islam's holiest city Sixteen Kuwaiti nationals were beheaded Thursday for the blasts, believed connected to an age-old feud between Sunni and Shiite Moslems. Most Iranians are Shiites, while Saudis and other gulf state Arabs are mainly Sunnis. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spokesman, who was not identified, denied Saudi charges that Iranian diplomats in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> trained and equipped the terrorists who set off explosions at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage, or hajj. He said recorded confessions of the condemned men, screened by Saudi television, were `` false allegations disseminated by the <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> government.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> said the executed men all were Kuwaiti nationals, but most were of Iranian, Saudi or Qatari origin. Four other defendants were sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison and 1,000 to 1,500 whiplashes for the bombings. Another nine people were acquitted. The rulings were made and upheld by lower and appeal courts made up of Islamic scholars. The Iranian spokesman rejected confessions by the condemned men that they were provided with explosives and timing devices by two Iranian officers at the embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Gholoum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON>. `` Those people were never employed in the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government is fully aware of this,'' the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has not commented on the executions. The Iranian spokesman said the attacks were carried out by `` mercenaries working for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> ... to suppress Moslems who ... reject the Saudi rulers' control of the two holy shrines'' _ Mecca and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. Two years ago, he charged, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> pushed pilgrims `` into blood and dust for the crime of disavowing the pagans.'' More than 400 people, mostly Iranians, died in clashes with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> security forces in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in 1987. The disturbances were the most serious of a series of incidents during pilgrimages since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution in 1979, fueled by Iranian efforts to politicize the hajj and encourage other Moslem nations to seize shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> from the control of the kingdom's <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> royal family. After the violence, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> limited the number of pilgrims and two years ago broke relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, citing subversion and terrorism. Lately, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has indicated he would like to mend the rift. The Iranian spokesman said <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>'s accusations against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are part of a campaign by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> Defense Minister Prince <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> to keep relations strained. `` This faction strongly desires continuation of enmity,'' it said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, taking a break today from recreation and work on his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speech, called on lawyers to involve themselves in community service and `` protect the unprotected.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, also urged the legal community to work for rights of the unborn in the fight over abortion. `` Use your talents, your energy, and your professional resources to reaffirm the right to life as the most fundamental freedom,'' he said. The president traveled to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he is spending the weekend before heading to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. Hitting one of his favorite themes _ the call to community service _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the lawyers in his speech to help the illiterate, the homeless and others in need. `` I challenge you, as <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, not to give in to the dismay of those today, who in the error of alarm have wandered from the basic convictions to which our nation is pledged. I challenge you to rekindle and foster a love of justice.'' `` Part of your task is to use your talents _ to speak for those unable to speak for themselves ... We must remember the unremembered. Protect the unprotected. And stand up for those who live in a world of pain,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, preparations for his first speech as president to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday were dominating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s work agenda over the weekend, an administration official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the central part of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address would be East-West relations, including the talks that were concluding in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> today between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Officials in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> reached agreement on on-site inspections of each other's underground nuclear test sites and on `` trial verification'' of each other's stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and received a letter from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on arms control issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped on the way to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> to stump for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s embattled gubernatorial candidate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> is in an uphill race against Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> to replace the outgoing Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. In sharply partisan remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a fund-raising luncheon the contest represents `` the future versus the past. Policies that work versus policies that do n't. A better future for our children, or one of lost opportunity.'' He also defended his plan to cut the capital gains tax against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> charges that it would be a tax break for the rich. `` It is a tax adjustment that is going to create jobs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that is why I am going to continue to fight for it,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Before heading to his seaside compound, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made a brief stop at a remote tree farm in nearby <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> to underscore his position on capital gains taxes, which are levied on profits from sales of real estate, stocks and other assets. Farm owner <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that 1986 changes in the capital gains tax law had cost him more than $ 4,000 in one year. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on sales of their trees because the trees are considered tangible assets rather than merchandise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also squeezed in nine holes of golf before nightfall with his national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, and fished for a short time.

 Less than two years after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdrew from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas swept in from the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> to unleash one of the most barbaric revolutions of modern times. This month, as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws troops that have propped up the Communist government, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> again are poised to strike from the jungles. And many fear that <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will again become the land of the killing fields. Led by a ruthless Communist with the alias of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> withstood massive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing and won the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> war with probably no more than 60,000 fighters in 1975. Their opponents _ the government of U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Gen. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nol </ORGANIZATION> _ fielded 300,000 men. The ratio is roughly the same today. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> strength is estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 and <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>'s at about 150,000. While there are new power brokers in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, the top <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leadership remains unchanged. Although the 61-year-old <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> claimed he resigned from his last official post in June, he still is believed to be in firm command. The secretive guerrilla chief, who has refused interviews for 10 years, spends his time along the Thai-Cambodian border and in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the key <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> arms supplier. Other durable veterans are <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s right-hand man <PERSON> Ieng </PERSON> <PERSON> Sary </PERSON> and nominal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, whose doctoral thesis was the blueprint for a bloody agrarian revolution. Heading the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> army is <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sen </LOCATION>, who approved the grisly tortures and executions of 20,000 alleged dissidents at <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>'s Tuol Sleng prison during the 1975-78 reign of terror Another key commander is <PERSON> Ta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mok </PERSON>, known as `` The Butcher'' for his murderous ways. These men have admitted to only `` some mistakes,'' and claim to have changed policies and methods. After being driven from <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> by a Vietnamese invasion in January 1979, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> operated from bases along the rugged Thai-Cambodian frontier. From there, its leaders announced they had shed radical Communism in favor of private property, freedom of religion, and a non-aligned foreign policy. It was a dramatic shift _ one met by instant skepticism. In their heydey, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> had `` cleansed the old society'' by killing hundreds of thousands, driving <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks from their monasteries and turning <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into a slave labor camp where even knives and forks were considered communal property. No mass executions have been reported in Khmer Rouge-controlled areas since 1979. But defectors, international aid workers and human rights groups indicate life under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> remains slave-like. Beatings and occasional executions are meted out for violating decrees. Women and youngsters are conscripted as porters for the military and forced at times to trek through minefields. Religious worship is permitted only at showcase camps. Contact with foreigners is severely restricted _ to the point of denying the gravely ill medical treatment offered by aid agencies. Perhaps the most damning testimony comes from Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, non-Communist leader of a three-party guerrilla resistance that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` One has to be either naive or an idiot to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> of the 80s can be different from the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> of the 70s,'' he has said. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> _ a term coined by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> meaning `` Red Cambodians'' _ emerged in the 1960s and began its armed struggle in 1968 as the war in neighboring <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was reaching a climax. With ideology borrowed from <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and French leftists, and with support from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Communists and a segment of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s rural population, the small, ragged band quickly grew into a movement Its initial appeal sprang from real grievances of the peasantry and centuries of humiliation by <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s more powerful neighbors. On April 17, 1975, <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> fell and its more than 2 million people were forced at gunpoint to march into the countryside and plant rice under appalling conditions. For the victors, it was `` Year Zero'' _ the re-making of society from scratch. For most of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people it was the beginning of an agony that lasted three years, eight months and 20 days. The defeated <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> army and its civilian followers straggled to the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border in 1979, sapped by malaria, hunger and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s juggernaut. It appeared <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s days were numbered. But the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was saved by geopolitics and international relief aid. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, non-communist <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and others were eager to bring <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to its knees, and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was the most readily available instrument. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> provided weapons, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> allowed the use of its territory and the majority of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member states vote year after year to include the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> as part of the <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> coalition to represent <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> at the world body. Critics charge this is the moral equivalent of inviting <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to sit in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after World War II. And Western aid officials struggle with the fact that they kept what some call a monster alive by continuing food, medical and other aid along the Thai-Cambodian border. After 11 years of war and the breakdown of peace talks, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> faces a new turning point. With <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s soldiers still on the way out, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> forces already are testing each other in a major battle for the the gem-rich border town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. Western analysts regard the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> as the strongest of the three guerrilla factions and probably tougher than the government's Soviet-supplied army `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in the last three months controls much more territory than they did before,'' said <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Souen </PERSON>, a defector from the Cambodian government army.

 An annual swim across the biblical Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> turned into a hike on Saturday after a drop in water level forced bathers to walk the final 400 yards. About 6,000 youths began the traditional 4-mile swim from the sea's southern shore.

<TEXT>
 Reach into your pocket for a quarter two or three years from now and you may find a different portrait of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> on the front and a flag instead of an eagle on the back. A majority of the nation's senators and representatives are bored with the nation's money _ not how it's spent but how it looks. They're tired of the eagle, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s home and the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> on the reverse _ or `` tails'' _ side of quarters, nickels and pennies and believe Americans want new coins not so `` fixed in the past.'' At least 260 of the 435 House members and 66 of the 100 senators have signed on as cosponsors of legislation originated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> calling for new coins. Under a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June without opposition and now working its way through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be required to modernize their designs, beginning with the quarter. The weight, size and color of each coin would not change. And portraits _ although not the same ones _ of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ would still adorn the obverse or `` heads'' sides of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter and half dollar. But the eagle now emblazoned on the reverse side of quarters and half dollars, <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION> on the nickel and the Lincoln Memorial on the penny would be replaced by themes celebrating the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Similar legislation was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year with hopes of having the new coins in circulation for the 1989-91 Bicentennial celebration of the Constitution. It never got anywhere in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because of opposition from Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on coinage <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, who now chairs another subcommittee, likes the present designs and looks upon efforts by coin collectors to change them as a low if not minuscule priority. `` Changes in our money make Americans very, very uneasy,'' he said. `` We have plenty of serious issues confronting us that need our attention ... a trade imbalance, a budget deficit, a drug epidemic, an education crisis. On a scale of importance from one to 10, coin design change rates a zero.'' His successor as the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., has no strong views one way or the other But after an emotional hearing this summer, he wants to proceed cautiously. `` There are some people who are very vocal about redesigning coins, but there's no public clamor out there for it,'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said in an interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is not too keen on the idea, even though the department calculates it would raise an additional $ 250 million in sorely needed government revenues over the next six years. The revenues would be in the form of `` seniorage'' _ the difference between the face value of the coin and what it costs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint to produce it. For example it costs the Mint only three cents to strike a quarter, creating a `` seniorage'' of 22 cents. Mint Director <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said officials anticipate that a new design would slightly increase the demand for coins in circulation _ raising seniorage revenues _ as some people hold on to either the old or new editions. But the revenues are not great enough to alone justify a change, she maintains, a point echoed by some congressmen. `` I think the public would be very cynical of our efforts if that's why we're doing it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiler </PERSON>, R-Ind `` Missing from the coin redesign debate,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, `` is any evidence that the general <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public _ the non-collecting public _ is dissatisfied with current coin designs, or even favors new ones.'' Several lawmakers also remember what happened the last time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided to order a change in coinage other than the special commemorative editions for collectors now produced by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint. About 300 million <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> silver dollars that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered in 1978 now sit in government vaults because of an overwhelming rejection by the public. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> blames the <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar and its failure on the women's caucus in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` The women on the banking committee collared every male member of that committee, and the poor guys could n't say no,'' he said. `` They created an atmosphere of hysteria. That's the reason it passed.'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, now the banking committee's chairman and a vehement supporter for redesigning the nation's coins, questioned during a hearing last year how many people knew who <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> -LRB- She was a leader of the women's suffrage movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s. -RRB- `` Maybe if we'd had <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, there would have been more popularity,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> joked. But to <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>'s charge that the <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar was a poorly conceived product of the women's movement, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said, `` That's what happens when you do n't have sex equality. The biggest advocate for changing the design of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coins is <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a New Yorker who, as an appointee of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, adopted the issue as a cause in 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> persuaded the commission to call for new designs, found sponsors for the legislation and then generated letter-writing campaigns on its behalf among thousands of coin collectors. `` The current designs are ordinary and boring,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> says. `` The images and symbols from the Great Depression will no longer suffice. We need images and symbols created by our best artists for this generation and for our time.'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, however, wants to amend the legislation to call for a temporary change in only one coin, most likely the quarter. A new edition reflecting the 200th anniversary of the Constitution would be struck, but only for two years. During that time, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be instructed to come up with possible new designs but the decision on adopting each would return to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> now has the authority to redesign coins every 25 years. But except for the <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar and special editions of the quarter, half dollar and silver dollar in 1975-76 commemorating the bicentennial of the American Revolution, the last design change was the adoption of the Kennedy half dollar in 1964. `` We should not minimize the psychological impact on the public of any change, especially touching on the national economy, as it seems to threaten its personal and national sense of security,'' says <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> <PERSON> Clain-Stefanelli </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s coin collection. As an example, Ms. <PERSON> Clain-Stefanelli </PERSON> cites V.D. <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>'s design of the Lincoln penny. The reverse or tails side was changed in 1959 to the Lincoln Memorial but the obverse or heads side has been unchanged since 1909. `` <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>'s creation has been endowed with the same immortality as that of the national figure it depicts,'' she said. Changing it now, she said, gives her `` a slightly uneasy feeling.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> dismisses many of the concerns as `` downright laughable'' and contends that skeptics who cite the failure of the <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar are `` mixing soup and nuts.'' `` We're the only Western World country stuck in a rut, and our coins should not be stuck in a rut,'' she says.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today predicted success for the sweeping reform agenda of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying change has gone too far to be stopped. `` I believe perestroika is now set on its course and will go through to success,'' the British leader told a news conference after four hours of talks with the Soviet president during her one-day stopover between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The two leaders met amid reports of a breakthrough in U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations. It was their fifth meeting since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was the first major <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> leader to see <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> since this summer's wave of strikes by miners in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and flareups of ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. She expressed great confidence in the 58-year-old <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader and his program for economic and social reforms, saying it `` opens up vistas and horizons not available to the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for some 70 years.'' Asked about current domestic woes faced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drive, she replied, `` Anything bold and purposeful will have difficulties to it.'' One of the topics discussed by the leaders was arms control, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she had been `` in touch'' with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the matter before meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. However, she declined to comment on anything <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have told her on the reported dramatic swing in the Soviet position on a superpower treaty being negotiated to slash long-range nuclear weapons arsenals. Some observers said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s good relations with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could help produce a breakthrough in superpower negotiations to cut the number of long-range nuclear missiles in half. But the breakthrough came in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Friday and today with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was dropping its insistence on limits on the Star Wars missile defense system before signing a treaty that would slash the number of long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines. The two sides also were reported near agreement on inspection of each other's underground nuclear test sites. Asked whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had mentioned the switch in the Soviet position, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that any announcement on that subject should be made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On other disarmament topics, she said she left her meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> believing East and West can reach an agreement reducing coventional weaponry by next year. She also said prospects were `` encouraging' for a ban on chemical weapons. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s personal relationship with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is warm, although she retains a watchful eye on Soviet military power. Relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> slid several months ago when the British expelled 11 Soviet journalists and diplomats on complaints of spying and the Soviets retaliated by expelling 11 Britons. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today: `` In <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomatic circles, it is believed that these differences should not be viewed as an obstacle to the development of relations between the two nations.''

<HEAD>Buyers Want Big Cars, Not Big Gas Mileage, Industry Argues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Concern about the environment is prompting a new push for automakers to produce more fuel efficient cars, but the industry says with gasoline prices low their customers want performance and size over fuel economy. According to <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> figures, the auto industry's move toward higher mileage cars has all but come to a halt in recent years. Average fleet-wide mileage jumped from 13.1 mpg in 1975 to 21.1 mpg in 1982. Since then it has been creeping and often standing still. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> mileage list announced last week reflected a fleet average of 24 mpg, the same as a year earlier. But growing environmental concerns and the link between automobile pollution and global warming, has unleashed new calls for the industry to produce more fuel efficient vehicles. Legislation by Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nev </LOCATION>., to require a 40 percent increase in average automobile fuel efficiency by the turn of the century, is given a good chance of passing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> That would put the average fleet-wide mileage for most manufacturers at about 40 mpg. Only some of the stingiest and smallest subcompacts are able to obtain those kinds of mileage figures today. No similar proposal has emerged in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where it would face the strong opposition of Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> But even serious discussion of such sharp increases in auto mileage is a far cry from only a year ago, when a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposal to scrap federal fuel efficiency standards altogether received considerable support on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made no such suggestion. Past demands for higher auto mileage were prompted by oil shortages and high gasoline prices. Today there is neither. So what is driving the renewed interest in fuel efficiency? `` The first and foremost reason is concern about global warming,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> an analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a group that includes many of the largest environmental and conservation organizations. Environmentalists also have argued that cutting the demand for gasoline is the best way to curb the need for oil _ and, thereby, preserve pristine wilderness and environmentally delicate coastal areas that otherwise might be opened for drilling. There also is continuing concern about the growing dependence on imported oil. `` In 1985, oil imports accounted for 32 percent of all oil used in this country. Last July imports exceeded 50 percent,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleviss </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. But it is the automobile's link to global warming that has given the issue a new spark. Motor vehicles account for about a fourth of the releases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to what many scientists believe is a warming of the earth because of manmade pollution. Carbon dioxide combines with other chemicals to form a gaseous veil in the atmosphere that traps heat like a greenhouse. Many scientists believe this `` greenhouse effect'' _ if left unchecked _ will cause a dangerous warming of the earth by the middle of the next century. `` It's time <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> stopped protecting their gas guzzlers and started protecting our planet by producing safe, efficient vehicles citizens want,'' <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said recently as her group unveiled plans to distribute a series of 30-second television ads linking cars to global warming. But the auto industry argues that it is being picked on unfairly. A requirement for cars to achieve and average fuel economy of 40 mpg `` does little to address the global warming problems'' because carbon dioxide releases from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cars account for only 2.5 percent of all the world's greenhouse gases, maintains <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrauskas </PERSON>, vice president for environmental and safety engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. And to achieve such mileage increases will require automakers to reduce the size of their cars, she and other auto executives insist There may be a lot of talk about higher mileage requirements, but market indicators are just the opposite, says <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boltz </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He said customers are `` placing a premium on vehicle performance ... and less emphasis on fuel economy.'' Cars such as the high-mileage Geo Metro _ a Japanese-made subcompact sold by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> _ account for only 1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passenger car sales, echoed <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vice president.

<HEAD>Audit a Case Study in HUD's `Revolving Door'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When government auditors in May 1988 asked <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> whether he knew an agency official named <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, he responded that he `` had been introduced to her. Six months later, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> auditors traveled to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to brief <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> officials on their critical findings. They encountered a familiar face. It was <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, then a privately employed housing consultant. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the former top aide to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, objected on the spot to the strong and harsh language used in various portions of the report,'' one auditor wrote in his notes. The notes are among boxes of working papers used to compile the audit. The documents, made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, provide a case study of the `` revolving door'' at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> that agency and congressional investigators believe contributed to scandals during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is just one of more than a dozen former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who had dealings with <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, a major lender in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs now facing an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of its conduct. Some of the former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials work at <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>, others are consultants to the firm and others still were developers who got financing through the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> lender. The auditors concluded that three former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, including Ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, reaped millions in `` unjustified profits'' by using their knowledge of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rules to create `` paper'' development and construction companies to increase <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidies. The former officials often financed their projects through <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, which has handled more than $ 2 billion in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> financing in the past 25 years. The federal investigators reviewed 14 of the more than 250 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects in which <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> has participated, and found in none of the 14 did the company use prudent underwriting practices. In fact, the report said many of the properties were appraised by <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> at exorbitant levels, allowing the company to reap larger fees on its HUD-backed mortgages. The audit recommended administrative sanctions against <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>. The company has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying it received <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> clearances for items questioned by the auditors. Still, the working papers indicate that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> officials made it no secret that they retained former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials to win favors at the agency. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> told the auditors <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> retained <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official and a close friend of Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s, `` when <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> needed a waiver from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to the working papers. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Karem </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who occassionally worked for <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, `` is paid to do waivers,'' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> told the auditors, according to their notes. Half the 14 <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> projects reviewed received waivers, in most cases permission to charge the maximum allowable rents in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects involved in a rehabilitation program. Since low-income tenants pay only a fraction of their income as rent, higher rents mean higher costs for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Karem </PERSON> and other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials were helping <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> and developers of projects it financed win waivers, another former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official was being called on by the company to appraise property. The auditors found it peculiar that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> on five occassions hired a Washington-based appraiser to review properties located in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, because of the higher fees for travel. The auditors, according to their notes, said they could find no reason for hiring the appraiser, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official, `` unless the distant firm gave the mortgagee the appraisal value that it wanted for the project.'' The 14 projects reviewed participated in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. A nationwide audit of that program triggered the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigations. In that report <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general found that former agency officials appeared to have received special treatment, as well as donors to a charity that a ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official helped found. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> and partners <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON> were developers or consultants on many of the 14 projects reviewed, increasing their profits by setting up development and contracting companies that the auditors said were in most cases disbanded after a project was completed. In essence, the <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> group made profits as builders and developers of projects in addition to their profits as owners. When not involved in the ownership of a Benton-financed project, <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON> often served as a consultant, as did a partner, former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Ronny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahon </PERSON>. Included in the audit papers are canceled checks showing <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON> made at least $ 216,000 in consulting fees from <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mahon </PERSON>, $ 363,578. Also among the canceled checks are a handful of <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> donations to FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a charity that former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> helped establish. It was <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, who was in charge of most housing programs, who granted most of the waivers <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> got on the audited projects. The canceled checks to FOOD total $ 19,000. `` All expenses appear to be legal, however, contributions to an organization which <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> ... is secretary is a strong indicator that contributions are made if you want to be involved in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s mod rehab program,'' the auditors wrote. They also found that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> contributed $ 15,000 to the `` President's Dinner'' a fund-raiser to help former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> buy a house in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The $ 15,000 payment for the ` President's Dinner' is another indicator of mod rehab units being awarded based on political consideration,'' the auditors said.

<HEAD>Bork Adds to Proliferation of Writings on Confirmation Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> says the conservative direction of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with newest member <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on board is little different from how the court would have leaned had he won confirmation instead. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, whose appointment to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seat in 1987 touched off a bitter fight between liberal and conservative groups, says he has generally agreed with the justices, with just one notable exception: he would have voted to uphold a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law banning flag burning. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> made the comments in an interview about his new book, `` The Tempting of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: The Political Seduction of the Law,'' to be published in the next few months. Although it is not specifically about the failed nomination, a number of pages discuss the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bid, <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> said. Other books about <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s fight for a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seat also are about to roll off the presses, two years after the defeat of the conservative legal scholar. `` I just think there will be a lot of these books in the next few years _ this is one people are going to chew on for a long time,'' says conservative activist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, whose forthcoming book, `` The Ninth Justice: Our Fight for <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>,'' was written with <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>. It tells the inside story of the conservative battle to swing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in favor of <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. A view from the liberal side is upcoming in `` The People Rising: The Campaign Against the <ORGANIZATION> Bork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nomination </ORGANIZATION>,'' by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pertschuk </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaetzel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s own book looks at the broad sweep of American history and argues that the law fell prey to politics, he said. He declined to go into much detail about the contents but said that if he had it to do over, he would change `` very little'' about his testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` What I said was what I think,'' said <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. At a distance of two years, <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> takes his rejection by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> philosophically. `` I do n't like what happened, but do I go around being bitter? No.'' After <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s rejection, then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated federal judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seat vacated by Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, however, withdrew in the midst of a furor over his earlier marijuana use. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then nominated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who was easily confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. One <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> book already on the shelves, `` Battle for Justice,'' by reporter <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronner </PERSON>, recently brought a complaint from Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. He said the book was incorrect in saying he informed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powell </ORGANIZATION>'s retirement plans the same day <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> informed him _ and thus broke a promise of overnight secrecy. `` That statement is in error,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. He said he did not contact the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> until the following day. Liberal critics of <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> who are grumbling privately that they should have been portrayed more favorably by <PERSON> Bronner </PERSON>'s book are virtually guaranteed to be consoled by <PERSON> Pertschuk </PERSON>'s account. <PERSON> Pertschuk </PERSON> acknowledges that his book takes as its heroes such groups as People for the American Way and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which crusaded against <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. `` We consider it an example of high democracy,'' he says. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gittenstein </PERSON>, chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> hearings, also is at work on a <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> book. `` I guess my slant is the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he says. `` I'm looking at it from where I was ... I'm also trying to look a little deeper at some of the issues that were involved.'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldeira </PERSON> is writing what could be `` the definitive book'' about the struggle. `` It will be scholarly,'' he said. `` It will be more detached. He has been interviewing me and a lot of the leftists as well.''

 <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> slept well, breathing without difficulty, and rose without assistance today from what earlier this week seemed certain to be his death bed. <PERSON> Fidelina </PERSON> <PERSON> Menjivar </PERSON>, a nurse attending to the former president, said in a telephone interview this morning that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s condition remains stable, slightly improved from the previous night. Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>, the former president's personal physician, reported on Friday that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had made a dramatic and surprising recovery from a bout with pneumonia that very nearly killed him. Miss <PERSON> Menjivar </PERSON> said X-rays taken last night showed that antibiotics were steadily shrinking the spot of pneumonia doctors had discovered in <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s right lung. The infection provoked a crisis that three times between Tuesday and Wednesday carried the cancer-ravaged <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> to the verge of death from asphyxiation. `` The threat of imminent death has disappeared,'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> late Friday. `` That man is some other kind of human being than yourself or myself.'' `` It is like night and day. From a moribund state, an agonizing state, he has progressed to a stable state,'' he said at midday after the former president's dramatic overnight improvement. <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> cautioned that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s conditon, because of the liver cancer, `` is still serious.'' He said it was impossible to predict when <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> will die from the incurable disease. When the cancer was diagnosed in June 1988, doctors gave <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> between six and 18 months to live. <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> and the medical team attending <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> at his home took chest X-rays on Friday. The physician said they showed a spot of pneumonia in the right lung. `` The crisis was the result of that infection,'' said <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>. He said antibiotics administered over the past two days have countered the infection. `` He is breathing well,'' said <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>, who added that the ex-president was talking lucidly with family and friends. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a civil engineer-turned-politician, was president from 1984 until last June 1 and was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemsiphere </LOCATION>.

 An army general said two men in custody have confessed to assassinating presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a killing that resulted in the government's declaration of war on drug traffickers, newspapers reported today. The reports quoted Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Niebles </PERSON> as saying the army now knows who hired the two gunmen, but the newspapers said he did not say who ordered the killing or if it was drug traffickers. On Friday, the government asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to respond to reports it has a secret list of Colombians suspected of having ties to drug lords and said such a list could damage relations between the countries. Also Friday, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> accepted the resignation of Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, long rumored to be quitting because of death threats by cocaine traffickers. Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said she resigned at <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s request. Sen. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, who was seeking the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination for March's presidential election, was killed Aug. 18 in a hail of machine gun fire at a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> rally. Barco blamed traffickers and declared an all-out war on them. The general's comments, at a news conference Friday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, got front - page attention in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s half dozen dailies today, even though the two men in custody have not been arraigned or charged The army has a reputation of forcing confessions from people who later recant in civilian courts. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s armed forces have the authority to arrest and detain people under a state of siege that has existed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for all but a few months of the last 40 years. Human rights groups such as the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have also said in reports that the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> army tortures civilians it has arrested. In 1979, President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Turbay </PERSON> gave the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> authority </ORGANIZATION> to arrest civilians suspected of leftist activities. The army still has that authority. The two men who confessed were part of a band called The Blackies, the general said. Two other men in the band are thought to have set off a 500-pound bomb Sept. 2 that seriously damaged the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>. The four men were captured Thursday in a house in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> where the army found weapons, ammunition and 220 pounds of dynamite packed under a car seat, the army said. Two more bombs exploded Friday night in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, one at a classified advertising office of the anti-drug crusading newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, and the other at a substation of the government-owned telephone company, police said. No injuries were reported in the blasts. They have occurred almost daily since the government began the crackdown after <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s death Nearly 80 percent of the cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is believed to come from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has given Barco more than $ 65 million for his war on drugs. A letter sent Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> marked the first open division between the nations since the crackdown began. The letter by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Londono </PERSON> <PERSON> Paredes </PERSON> came a day after Colombian media published the names of 25 Colombians, including federal lawmakers, who are on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged blacklist. <PERSON> Londono </PERSON> said such a list `` without an adequate clarification and precise explanation, could generate a climate of undesirable relations between our two countries.'' The contents of the letter, sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> McLain </PERSON>, was broadcast by the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. Senators on the alleged list charged that they were being persecuted for disagreeing with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and calling for the legalization fo drugs. After meeting with <PERSON> Londono </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McLain </PERSON> told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not `` make lists of people who receive visas or do n't receive visas because of social or political activities. There is no blacklist or list of any other color.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies do have computer lists of foreign nationals involved in allegations of wrongdoing. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> embassy had a blacklist but said the mission's visa officer considers any allegations in deciding whether to approve a visa application. All applicants have an opportunity to rebut allegations, he said.

 A man sought in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for a string of holdups and prison escapes committed suicide today during a shootout with police that occurred after he released three hostages, police said. Police first reported they killed <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaire </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and seriously wounded one of his Belgian accomplices, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagemans </PERSON>, 31, during the shootout in an apartment building. But prosecutor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourguignont </PERSON> later told reporters that <PERSON> Delaire </PERSON> killed himself during the confrontation. A third gunman, Belgian <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Delecki </PERSON>, 36, was arrested unharmed. The shootout ended a standoff that began Sept. 16 when the three men kidnapped a bank manager, his wife and their two daughters in their home in <LOCATION> Tilff </LOCATION>, a residential southern suburb of <LOCATION> Liege </LOCATION>. The banker escaped and alerted police, who surrounded the villa. After a week of negotiations with policemen, the three gunmen agreed to release their hostages for a ransom of $ 750,000 and an <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. They released the two girls, <PERSON> Gaelle </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON>, 12, on Friday and drove away with the mother, whom they later freed on the road toward <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. Two police helicopters chased the men, and all main roads and border crossings were guarded. Spotting policemen at the border, the three men drove back to a 28-story apartment building in <LOCATION> Liege </LOCATION>, where the shootout occurred. Police said <PERSON> Delaire </PERSON> shot first and was killed by a bullet in the head. The wounds of Wagemans were not described. <PERSON> Delaire </PERSON>, who was born in northern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, had a brief but wild criminal career there, police said. Jailed for holdups, he escaped for the first time from a prison in <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, in 1985. He committed other holdups in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, many in the <LOCATION> Liege </LOCATION> area, taking hostages to cover his escape. Arrested several times in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, he escaped again and again. Last year, he forced a helicopter pilot to free a friend from a prison in <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Police said he also was sought for questioning in the killing a 20-year-old African boxer in a <LOCATION> Liege </LOCATION> bar in 1985. In several cases, police said, he molested or injured his hostages. But no injuries were reported to his hostages In <LOCATION> Tilff </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Iraqis Launch New Push Against Guerrillas, Kurds Claim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s army has launched a new offensive against Kurdish guerrillas in their northern stronghold near the Iranian border, the first major assault in a year, a guerrilla spokesman said Saturday. The 24th Division or the Iraqi army, supported by artillery and helicopter gunships, has sought to `` encircle the region controlled by the -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- and move in to captures Kurdish bases,'' said the official of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>. At least 57 Iraqi soldiers have been killed in clashes since Sept. 18 in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s northeastern mountains, he said. He put losses among the guerrillas, known as Peshmergas or `` those who face death,'' at three killed and 12 wounded. The official, who is known to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, spoke in a telephone interview from a West European capital. He asked that his name and location not be mentioned for security reasons. Fighting centered north of <LOCATION> Qala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diza </LOCATION>, the city whose population was forcibly evacuated by the Iraqis several months ago in a drive to create a buffer zone along the Iranian border to prevent the guerrillas from receiving support from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the official charged. Earlier this year, he said, tens of thousands of Kurds from scores of villages around <PERSON> Qala </PERSON> <PERSON> Diza </PERSON> were forced out and their settlements were razed. The city is 15 miles west of the border. `` So far all the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> assaults have been repulsed,'' he reported. `` The Iraqis have turned the area into one big free-fire zone in recent months. They claim we've been crushed, but this shows that the Kurdish resistance is alive and kicking.'' Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and Kurdish officials estimate more than 250,000 Kurds have been relocated forcibly over the past two years and hundreds of villages have been razed in Iraqi efforts to isolate the guerrillas. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government admits it has moved large numbers of Kurdish civilians to other regions. But officials say this was for unspecified security reasons and to provide villagers with modern housing. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting on and off for more than 50 years for an autonomous homeland. The government promises limited autonomy and earlier this month held elections in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> for a legislative assembly. Kurdish separatists charge the assembly is powerless and branded the voting `` no different to previous sham elections held since 1975,'' when the assembly first was established. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s last major offensive against the Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas was August 1988, soon after a U.N.-sponsored truce halted its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iraqis allegedly used poison gas in attacks that forced tens of thousands of Kurds to flee into neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> denies the charges. About 19 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where the borders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> meet. Another 1 million are scattered in the southwestern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and northeastern <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New President De Klerk May Find Promised Reforms Difficult</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has brought a new style and new possibilities to South African politics, but an array of obstacles stands in the way of his professed goals of peace, justice and black-white power-sharing. Yet the fact that de Klerk states these goals, repeatedly and earnestly, sets him apart from the men who preceded him in power. Prominent black opponents of his government are deeply skeptical, and they may be proved right. Some of them concede, however, that the government for the first time has adopted a rhetoric, if not yet a policy, that reflects some of their own hopes. `` His vision of a new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ... is the vision we want,'' said Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize and one of the government's most persistent critics. So sweeping are some of de Klerk's statements _ no more white domination, a phasing out of discrimination _ that he may find he has raised expectations he can not meet. He acknowledged this in his inaugural speech Wednesday, saying he would not accept responsibility for `` overenthusiastic or twisted versions'' of his policy. He will be under heavy pressure to move quickly, with anti-apartheid leaders and Western governments saying they want decisive steps taken within the next several months. Among the moves <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will consider: _ Releasing <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and other jailed leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> knows that a broad range of black leaders will refuse to negotiate on a new constitution unless <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> goes free, and is likely to approve the release despite fears in some government quarters that it could spark a wave of unrest. _ Modifying or repealing the remaining legislative cornerstones of apartheid, the laws which classify South Africans by race, allow municipalities to segregate public facilities, and establish segregated residential districts `` The continued removal of discrimination is an important objective,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> in his inaugural speech. But he has yet to renounce his support for segregated schools and neighborhoods. _ Lifting the state of emergency, which has been in effect since June 1986 <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> says hopes to `` create a climate'' in which the emergency can be ended, and he already has negated some of impact by ordering police to allow peaceful mass protest marches. But police continue to detain activists without charge. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> Relly </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest conglomerate and frequent critic of apartheid, has urged the international community to give <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> a chance to carry out his program without imposing a timetable or threatening further sanctions. `` Just as <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- has found that perestroika can not be achieved in the twinkling of an eye, and that serious attitudinal and institutional obstacles have to be confronted and gradually overcome, so Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will have to confront difficulties of the same order,'' said Relly, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper in <LOCATION> Jonhannesburg </LOCATION>, also likened <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying both leaders were learning that the process of reform `` is not to direct change, but to ease controls and wait for the unknowable to happen.'' For <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, this syndrome is most evident in his decision two weeks ago, while acting president, to allow mass protest marches. Tens of thousands of people of all races have joined anti-government parades in major cities, including militants displaying banners of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Like <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has a security establishment who prefer the old way of doing things,'' said The Weekly Mail. `` Perhaps the biggest question if whether de Klerk shares <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s resolve and wile to outmaneuver the ` securocrats. The centerpiece of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s program is a vague proposal to negotiate a new constitution that will extend political rights to the country's 28 million blacks while protecting the 5 million whites from black domination. In effect, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is suggesting that each racial group would have veto power over major policy decisions, with deadlocks to be broken by some sort of independent arbitrator. It is highly unlikely that even moderate black leaders, let alone the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, would accept an outcome that falls so far short of a one-person, one-vote system. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> released a statement Friday night dismissing <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s pledges of reform and calling for a continued armed struggle against the government `` The rhetoric mouthed by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> at his inauguration once more bears out our firm conviction that no white minority regime possesses either the will or the capacity to bring about a fundamental change of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said the statement, released in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. But blacks might be willing to sit down and talk if <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> takes the preliminary steps they have demanded _ freeing <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, legalizing the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, lifting the emergency and curbs on political activity. The most powerful black moderate, Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, said he was convinced de Klerk intended to move forward. He called on blacks to `` move away from the weak position of revolution and internal violence, which can never bring victory for democracy, and move toward the politics of negotiation.'' An indication of the flux in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> came last week in an editorial in the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Times, a newspaper published by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s ruling party that customarily depicts the white government in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> as evil and racist `` One still needs to avoid celebrating,'' it said. `` One needs time to see whether the de Klerk government will make significant follow-ups to these promising beginnings. ... But if this is a sign of things to come, then all of us need to encourage the president.''

 Finance officials of the world's seven biggest economic powers met today amid renewed calls for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to curb the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit as its contribution toward stabilizing world currency markets. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> hosted the private talks at the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with their counterparts from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ the so-called Group of Seven. The finance ministers and central bankers from the seven nations were expected to discuss their seeming failure to stabilize world currency markets. The dollar is trading above the targets they set despite a declaration at the officials' last meeting in April seeking no further increase. A strong dollar hurts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to reduce its trade deficit because it raises the price of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports overseas and makes foreign goods cheaper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The dollar's rise since the spring has come in the face of repeated and heavy selling by the G-7 nations' central banks in an effort to drive its value down. In advance of the session, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration insisted coordination efforts had not broken down. But officials of other nations said more was needed. Specifically, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> must reduce the demand for dollars created by its budget deficit, said a senior <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> official, speaking to reporters on condition she not be identified by name. `` One of the values of these meetings is peer pressure and the need to make the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> repeatedly aware, the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that the key to the imbalances problem is not some sort of exchange rate policy that brings down an overly strong dollar. ... The best way to do that is a tighter fiscal policy,'' the official said. A senior official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged, `` We all recognize that more needs to be done. ... The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must reduce its budget deficit,'' but said that nations with trade surpluses -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- must stimulate consumer demand at home so they are less dependent on export sales. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said if the dollar were to continue its upswing `` for a lengthy period of time, this obviously, is a matter of concern ... because obviously we have more -LRB- trade adjustments -RRB- to accomplish.'' Despite the talk before today's meeting, many private economists said they were expecting little more than vague rhetoric when the G-7 issues a communique at the end of the session. `` I would be shocked if anything really happened,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an economic consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` But I think they will reiterate the fact that stable currencies are better and that they will work together to keep the fluctuations down without saying very much about where they should go,'' Trading in currency markets Friday seemed to reflect that skepticism. The dollar rose in thin, erratic trading despite the fourth straight day of Federal Reserve dollar selling. At the end of the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar rose to 146.05 yen from 145.65 on Thursday. The Group of Seven discussions were being held before the start of the annual meetings of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and its sister lending organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> officials are pushing for a doubling of the fund's resources to allow it to better handle the crushing $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not reached a conclusion that such an increase is needed.

<HEAD>Hurricane Ravaged Islands Teetered on Anarchy, Officials Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal officials say <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers found anarchy on hurricane-ravaged <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> just hours after the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>' governor gave emphatic assurances the island was peaceful. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter crew that flew over the island Wednesday morning to survey damage from Hurricane Hugo spotted bands of looters armed with machetes and guns, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` Basically there was total lawlessness from everything they saw,'' said the spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON>. A team of five <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents dispatched by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> arrived about the same time and by Wednesday afternoon reported that `` there had been a complete breakdown of law and order,'' said an administration official. The agents found `` roving bands of thugs'' looting shops and attacking homes, the official said. Some 150 convicts who had escaped from two prisons were also on the loose. Until federal agents arrived Wednesday morning, it was difficult for officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to get information because communications had been cut off with the storm-ravaged island. The accounts of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> conflicted starkly with the report the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> received from Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> on Tuesday night. `` The governor emphatically stated there was no law-and-order problem and matters we well in hand,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The governor's statement was also at odds with a plea made over ham radio earlier Tuesday night by an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney on <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Croix </PERSON>, who expressed fear that looting convicts might exact revenge on law enforcement officers and judges, the official said. The prosecutor's report was the basis for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision to send in the team of five <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to survey the situation, the official said. As that team was arriving in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> established contact with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal for the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> `` who reported that there was anarchy, it was very serious situation,'' the official said. As the picture of violence and lawlessness became more detailed, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials went to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop contingency plans for dealing with the situation. After consulting with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> decided to send the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s hostage rescue team and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' special operations group to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION> to protect federal officials and property At 2 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> met with the senior <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and requested a battalion of military police to help restore order, said the official. A presidential proclamation was quickly drafted at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and orders were issued to send in military police to restore order. <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON>'s request was reported to the White House by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. But the presidential order was based on a law that allows the chief executive to send in troops without a governor's request. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` was relying on his own judgment based on other reports that it was important to restore law and order,'' the official said. The decision to send in troops was made after `` federal authorities on the scene were reporting chaos, and near anarchy and the situation as being out of control,'' Admiral <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said last week in an interview. Later Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> publicly denied that he had asked for troops. During interviews Thursday, the governor said reports of lawlessness and looting were exaggerated. He made the comments after 1,100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and 100 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals had arrived in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. By Friday, <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> had ceded all law enforcement power to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which now has comprehensive authority to make arrests and conduct prosecutions for violations of both federal and territorial law.

<HEAD>Study Finds Hope for Reduced Military Spending Worldwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Improved U.S.-Soviet relations along with other factors offer the rare prospect of a decline in worldwide military spending, according to a new study released Saturday. `` In many respects, the decade of the 1980s is ending on a more hopeful note than it had at the start,'' says the study, `` World Military and Social Expenditures 1989.'' The report was written by <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sivard </PERSON>, a former official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Each year she publishes an updated version of global military spending and how it compares with spending on human resources. Her principle thesis is that defense spending absorbs funds desperately needed for social programs. Ms. <PERSON> Sivard </PERSON> writes that the positive trends at the end of the decade have not as yet had a measureable impact on government budgets and that world military spending is still at record levels. Nonetheless, Ms. <PERSON> Sivard </PERSON> cites as causes for optimism the superpower rapprochement, the winding down of wars in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the revival of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' role as a peacemaker. The report also notes that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ countries which large military establishments _ all have undertaken personnel cutbacks. Beyond that, she says, no new wars started over the past year for the first time in 31 years. Still, in real terms, military expenditures have continued to rise with the expansion of the global economy and may have reached the $ 1 trillion mark worldwide for the first time last year, the report says. In 1986, the last year for which complete figures are available, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent about $ 281 billion on defense and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> $ 271 billion, accounting for about 62 per cent of global military spending, the report says. It adds the global `` obsession'' with military force since World War II has produced hundreds of millions of casualties, not only from war but from neglect of urgent human needs. As an example, the study cites `` the appalling number of lives lost to hunger and to other killer-diseases that are preventable at the cost of a few dollars for an individual life.'' The study also makes these obsevations: _ Six times as much public research money goes for research on weapons as for research on health protection _ Every minute, 15 children in the world die for want of essential food and inexpensive vaccines, and the world military machine takes $ 1.9 million from the public treasury _ The chances of dying from social neglect are 33 times greater than the chances of dying in war _ In the developing world, there is one soldier per 240 inhabitants, one physician per 1,950 _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, the top ranking military powers, rank 17th and 45th among all nations in infant mortality rates _ Since 1960, developing countries have increased military expenditures more than twice as fast as living standards, measured by per capita income

 Hundreds of National Guardsmen patrolled ravaged streets against looting today, and police reported more than 90 arrests as residents returned to begin the long task of rebuilding from Hurricane Hugo. Chainsaws buzzed, crews worked around the clock to restore power and telephone communications, and insurance agents across the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> braced for claims that could run into the billions from the region's most devastating hurricane in 30 years. `` It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seen anywhere,'' Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said after surveying the destruction by helicopter. `` We're going to be a long time digging out of this and rebuilding.'' The hurricane was blamed for 18 deaths in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In the six hours <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and its 135 mph winds surged through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, it flattened dozens of homes and buildings, snapped trees, twisted bridges and washed scores of boats ashore. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said damage in his 3-century-old city alone might reach $ 1 billion. `` There's just destruction everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who imposed a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. Police reported isolated cases of looting. Fifty people were arrested in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>; 12 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>; and at least three in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, police Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said today that 27 people were arrested Friday and early today for looting and one for violating curfew. `` It was very quiet last night. I left at 1 a.m. and the only thing I saw were police cars and National Guardsmen,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Two people from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, he said, were posing as relief workers who then would take people's possessions; they had not been charged yet. The governor deployed 2,600 National Guardsmen to patrol streets, enforce the curfew, help remove debris, purify water and perform other duties. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said power should be restored by tonight at hospitals, but he could not estimate when residents might get power. Mail delivery could resume Monday, and he recommended that people boil water before drinking it. Up to half a million customers across the state were without power as of late Friday. In inland <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, people lined up at an ice warehouse with coolers. Some areas of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> were without water, and residents were told to boil their drinking water. Two hundred miles inland, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, also sustained heavy damage, and nearly 80 percent of the customers in the city of 375,000 were still without power this morning, said <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>. There were 14 deaths in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from the storm itself, related traffic accidents, and heart attacks suffered during cleanup, according to the state Emergency Preparedness Division. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, three deaths in the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> area were blamed on the storm, and a 6-month-old baby died in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> when a tree crashed into a house. Two people were killed by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> after it moved into <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as a tropical storm. In the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> first touched land, the storm killed at least 27 people and left 50,000 homeless. `` All things considered, we lucked out in a lot of ways,'' said <PERSON> Chipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, where the most serious injury reported was a broken pelvis suffered by a woman when a tree crashed through her roof. The hurricane and its tidal waves of up to 17 feet smashed ashore at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> late Thursday. After being downgraded to a tropical storm, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> advanced farther west than expected, whisking through <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where the National Hurricane Center stopped tracking it. By the time it reached <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on Friday night, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was generating winds under 40 mph and was no longer classified as a tropical storm. As it fizzled early today, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s dying remnants darted through <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and became lost in another weather front, according to meteorologist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We really ca n't find it anymore,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties _ with a total of 750,000 residents _ a disaster area. The declaration frees up federal aid for housing, loans and grants for rebuilding. Hundreds of insurance adjusters have come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to process the damage claims, but it will be days before they begin to catch up, said state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. Along the coast, Folly Beach, <ORGANIZATION> Isle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palms </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were devastated. `` Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said <LOCATION> Horry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> administrator M.L. Love after he toured the small unincorporated town near <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He said damage there could run in the hundreds of millions. Residents of the Isle of Palms and <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which were among the hardest-hit barrier islands, were kept from even inspecting their homes because the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> swing bridge _ the only link to the mainland _ was knocked out. About 100 boats that had been berthed at one marina were `` stacked up like cordwood,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON>, a state Wildlife and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s Island had a 100-foot channel of water through it. `` There are now two <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, if you will,'' pilot <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON> said after flying over the island. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had dispatched planes and ships from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and Naval bases as <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> approached, the installations suffered perhaps $ 50 million in damage, said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, a city of about 65,000 people, took the full force of Hugo. Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> weathered the storm, but <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, the first Union stronghold fired upon by the Confederacy at the beginning of the Civil War, suffered $ 1 million damage when a 17-foot wall of water roared over it, federal officials said.

 Advocates for the mentally retarded hope a judge has set an example for others around the country by ordering <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials to seek money to restore services for retarded Philadelphians who live at home. `` This decision is the first in the nation holding that people with retardation have a right to those services,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON>, attorney for an advocacy group that joined the city in seeking the state money. The decision also marks the beginning of a move to state courts instead of federal court, where <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON>'s group, the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handicapped </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, lost earlier this year in a similar case. Commonwealth Court Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> last week gave the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> until Oct. 2 to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to provide the $ 7.56 million needed for services that had been cut or canceled for up to 7,750 mentally retarded Philadelphians. The order does not cover the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON> said if the lawmakers turn down the request, he would ask the judge to order the department to find the funds elsewhere in its budget. The judge ruled that state officials breached their responsibility under state law to assure `` adequate mental retardation services for all persons who need them.'' <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON>'s opinion took state officials to task for failing to evaluate the needs of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s mentally retarded in coming up with a budget. Instead, the state just added a little more to what had been budgeted before, whether that previous amount met actual needs. The ruling dealt only with the state's handling of one county. But `` that thing will be widely disseminated,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, deputy director for governmental activities for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cerebral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would suggest there are other parties in other states where they have similar grounds under their state laws,'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said. `` Very few states base their budgets on actual client need. That issue will be true everywhere,'' <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON> said. A 1987 survey by the Association for Retarded Citizens found 76,000 people waiting for day programs around the country. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, deputy city solicitor for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, is n't convinced of a national effect of <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON>'s ruling `` Our lawsuit is under state law,'' he said simply. However, state law is becoming the chosen legal strategy as groups push for services to keep people out of institutions, integrate them into society and help them do things for themselves. The move to state courts began with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in February that held the state of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> did not have a constitutional duty to protect a boy who suffered brain damage from repeated beatings by his father. <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON>'s group won an initial victory in federal court on rights for the retarded to community services under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. But the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed the case, citing the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> ruling as grounds. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the state public advocate has sued the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in state court, contending the agency was n't providing appropriate community services to about 3,300 people. `` In recent years the federal Constitution has been interpreted increasingly narrowly on disabilities issues. And some of the state constitutions have been providing greater protection,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Headley </PERSON>, an attorney for the public advocate. Advocates like to see efforts succeed in other states. `` It's always important that some other judge somewhere else was willing to do this,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischner </PERSON>, attorney for the Center for Public Representation in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Law in the Public Interest, said her group won a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that state law required community treatment for the chronically mentally ill. A national solution could come from outside the courts The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the next two weeks may consider a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, and co-sponsored by 53 others, that would eventually make such services a federal right _ the way <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated in 1975 that disabled children have a right to go to school.

 The co-pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was making his first takeoff in a passenger-carrying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 when he mistakenly pushed a button that cut the throttle, investigators said. The pilot tried to remedy the error by increasing engine thrust manually, but then decided to abort the takeoff, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON>, acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference Friday night. Also Friday, authorities suspended the pilot's and co-pilot's flight licenses for leaving the scene of the crash Two passengers died when the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-bound plane skidded off the end of <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> runway Wednesday night. Though he described the mistake by co-pilot <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON>, 29, and detailed his lack of experience on that model of aircraft, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> did n't explicitly blame pilot error for the crash or say if investigators had pinpointed the cause. The co-pilot was in charge of the highly computerized controls when he mistakenly pushed the `` auto-throttle disconnect button'' as the aircraft was rolling down the runway, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The automatic throttles are programmed by the flight crew. The button Kleissaf should have pushed would have accelerated the plane automatically to a preset speed for takeoff, he said. As the plane continued down the runway, the pilot, 36-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, jumped in to try to increase the throttle manually, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The plane started drifting to the left and `` the pilot felt and heard a vibration which concerned him,'' and then cut power to abort the takeoff, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The pilots also failed to call out the jetliner's speed as it rolled down the runway as required, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. `` It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit,'' he said. <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> had controlled takeoffs in 737-400s in training, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said, but had never taken off in that model plane with passengers aboard. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has been a captain since July 1 and had flown only 138 hours in that capacity on the 737-400, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. He had about 4,000 hours on all models of 737s, mostly as a co-pilot, the paper said, quoting unnamed government and industry sources. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records show <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> received his commercial pilot's license in October 1987 and an instructor's license six months later. His <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> record is clean, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. Investigators questioned <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> separately for five hours Friday Both men later submitted to urine tests for drug and alcohol, but the results were n't immediately available, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Friday suspended <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON>'s flight licenses because they left the scene after the crash and could not be questioned immediately by investigators, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said. He called their conduct `` highly questionable.'' At his news conference, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> also criticized the pair for not volunteering for alcohol and drug tests earlier. `` The provision of urine samples and no blood samples almost two days after this accident seriously impedes our investigation and unnecessarily creates an environment of suspicion,'' he said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> helped passengers out of the plane after the crash, and that airline regulations did n't require them to remain at the scene. He also said both pilots went to a hospital for treatment Thursday, which partly explained their absence. Immediately after the crash, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> took a rescue boat to the airport and then a taxi to a nearby hotel, where he called his union representative, <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Friday defending the crew. `` There was nothing unusual in the crew's performance, no federal rules were broken and the crew has cooperated completely with the investigation,'' it said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> tried to check into a hotel as ordered by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, and when he could n't get a room, went to the home of another pilot to rest, the union said, adding that he stayed in touch with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> officials. But <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> denied that. `` He did not contact us and we did not tell him to go to the hotel,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. The co-pilot was quoted after the crash as saying the pilot was incoherent before the flight. But <PERSON> Kohlstad </PERSON> said other crew members had n't noticed anything unusual in his behavior. <PERSON> Kleissaf </PERSON> has apologized for his remarks, the investigator said. Workers on Friday began removing the partially submerged aircraft, which cracked into three pieces, from the water. The plane had been delivered in January and had no history of mechanical problems, said airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>.

 A mural project sponsored by an anti-AIDS group to remind drug users to avoid sharing needles has run into trouble with <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s beautification campaign. The problem _ the murals look a lot like graffiti. Businesses and city officials are complaining about the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> effort called Project Safe. It involved asking local artists to paint murals in three drug-ridden neighborhoods to provide AIDS warnings such as, `` Do n't Share Use Bleach.'' To appeal to their intended audience, the state-funded artists spray painted their messages in bold colors _ making it look like the graffiti the city is trying to wipe out in the same neighborhoods. `` -LRB- We are -RRB- looking at some other ways of getting that message across rather than using walls,'' said <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Purser </PERSON> of the Keep Denver Beautiful anti-graffiti campaign. `` To sanction any type of graffiti murals would be detrimental to the campaign,'' said <PERSON> Purser </PERSON>. But the message has to reach those whose lifestyles make them susceptible to AIDS, said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s division for sexually transmitted diseases, which helped with the project. `` At this point, we're just trying to figure out the value and effectiveness of the murals, and take into consideration the concerns in the areas they have voiced,'' said Finn. The mural campaign resulted from suggestions by prostitutes and intravenous drug abusers at the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> jail, said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marusich </PERSON> of the health department. The inmates were brought together in a `` focus group,'' a sort of bull session of the type used by advertising people to learn about the preferences of average citizens. `` You've got to reach people on the street in a way they're going to respond and recognize,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marusich </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to reach our audience first of all ... the appropriate audience with the appropriate message.'' Information about AIDS transmission must reach people who live in a very different way, she said. `` We're talking about drug dens with blood sprayed on the ceiling, where people stay in the dark, shoot their drugs and really try and shut out the outside world,'' she said. `` We've been inside shooting galleries to get a real good feel for what is happening.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, an aide to Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, said the project's intentions are good, but the method is not `` In our experience, anything that resembles graffiti attracts more graffiti,'' he said. `` Obviously their goal is an important one.'' The Five Points Business Association, in a lower middle-class neighborhood, is objecting to one of the murals. `` We're addressing a letter to the governor,'' said association president <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. `` We do not want that kind of a mural in our area. We are trying to clean it up.'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the money for the murals, about $ 1,500 from a state health department grant, would have been spent better on other forms of education. <PERSON> Purser </PERSON> said the money private landowners, businesses and the city have invested in such neighborhoods as Five Points could be jeopardized by the murals. `` We're trying to revitalize,'' she said. `` Then you have this huge sign right there in the middle of it. As a developer, you're saying, ` Why is this graffiti-type drug message there?' Alternatives such as ordinary signs, plywood panels attached to buildings and bench advertisements are being considered, <PERSON> Purser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marusich </PERSON> said the group hopes to produce several murals _ in some form _ every three or four months. `` The point is there is drugs in Five Points,'' she said. `` There are people who are becoming infected and infecting others.'' The most rapid spread of AIDS at this point in the epidemic involves the sharing of contaminated needles or syringes by drug abusers and subsequent sexual contact involving those infected through drug use. Federal officials said at the end of June that intravenous drug abusers made up 23 percent of the more than 100,000 cases of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>NASA Plans Last Unmanned Rocket Launch from Cape Canaveral Monday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For three decades, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has launched unmanned rockets from this spaceport _ more than 400 of them. On Monday it plans to fire its last one here, closing an illustrious chapter in American space history. The fiery finale will be staged by an Atlas-Centaur rocket which is to blast off at 4:12 a.m. with a military communications satellite to link land, sea and air forces around the world with the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the president. Once the Atlas-Centaur is gone, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s only launch vehicle at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> will be the manned space shuttle. When the agency has a need for an expendable rocket, it will have to buy the launch services from private industry. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has purchased unmanned boosters from companies such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and used its own crews to launch them. In the future, crews from private companies will conduct the countdowns at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> as the nation's budding commercial launch industry takes off. The space agency stopped buying Atlas-Centaur, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and other space boosters early in the 1980s, opting instead to launch all its payloads from the space shuttle. Officials admitted that was a mistake after the shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. Following the explosion, then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> directed <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to get out of the business of launching commercial payloads, opening the way for rocket companies to start a new enterprise. A backlog of government payloads and a desire to keep space business from being sent abroad to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> spurred the policy change. After the launch of the last Atlas-Centaur, the agency will have one large unmanned rocket left, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> that is to lift a scientific satellite from <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in November. And the government will continue to launch military space rockets from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. Still, Monday's launch is a milestone for <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> got its start and where it has launched more than 95 percent of its boosters. `` It's always sad to see the end of an era,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Womack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of expendable launch vehicles, who will be in the launch control center Monday. `` There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we have done have been fabulous,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahon </PERSON>, the agency's assistant administrator for space flight. Among the achievements: The Mariner, Viking, Pioneer and Voyager missions to the planets; 42 weather satellites; the Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronauts landing there; 94 communications satellites; scores of scientific payloads; dozens of unmanned test launches for the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo man-in-space projects. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s first launch vehicle was a Thor Able that lifted off Oct. 11, 1958, propelling the Pioneer 1 probe toward a flyby of the moon. It failed, as did four more rockets before a Juno 2 hurled Pioneer 3 within 37,300 miles of the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and into orbit around the sun on March 3, 1959. Three more failures followed before the successful launch of Explorer 6, a radiation-study satellite, on Aug. 7, 1959. Other failures followed, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s overall success rate stands at more than 90 percent of 447 launches. In recent years the burden has been borne by two workhorse rockets, the Atlas-Centaur, which will be making its 68th appearance on Monday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, with 184 liftoffs. Both have a success rate of more than 95 percent. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has ordered launch services starting next year from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> for four Atlas-Centaurs to boost three weather satellites and a sun-studying payload, and the agency plans to use three Titan rockets launched by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> to hoist planetary probes in the 1990s. The change involves no layoffs, since private contractors already filled many of the ranks of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s launch teams and some personnel are being shifted to the shuttle or other space agency programs.

 Police arrested more than 150 people, clashed with angry blacks and cordoned off a cathedral with barbed wire Saturday in a massive operation to stop a march by anti-apartheid women's groups. Two blocks from the church, where thousands of women had planned to assemble, white extremists went ahead with two government-approved rallies. Fights broke out between the khaki-clad neo-Nazis and black onlookers. Police made several arrests and chased blacks away with batons. Downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> resembled a militarized zone, with major streets closed to civilian traffic throughout normally busy morning shopping hours. Hundreds of policemen and scores of riot-control vehicles were deployed to prevent the women's march and monitor the right-wing rallies. The white extremists sought and received permission to demonstrate, but the women's planned march to government headquarters was banned because organizers refused to seek a permit. Authorities also said they feared simultaneous protests by such diverse factions might spark violence. <PERSON> Zeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshongweni </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for organizers of the women's march, said many would-be marchers were arrested when they tried to assemble near the Union Buildings, their intended destination Other activists said several people, including children and elderly women, were injured when police used clubs and dogs to disperse the crowd. Police said 154 people were arrested, all released after being told to appear in court Monday. Police headquarters said most of the arrests came when officers were pelted with stones and bottles while confronting scores of blacks, including well-known activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, at a trade union office after the march was canceled. Police said three people were injured, but gave no details. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and other blacks aboard two buses later were chased by a convoy of police vehicles and ordered to leave <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` We came here peacefully but they are seeking violence,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said. Some of the biggest marches in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s history have taken place in the past two weeks, after new President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said his government would allow peaceful protests. Authorities announced Friday that leaders of such marches must obtain advance approval. An authorized anti-apartheid march was held Saturday in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. An estimated 2,500 mixed-race residents paraded peacefully from their segregated neighborhood to the downtown area to protest the right-wing-controlled city council's reimposition of strict segregation ordinances. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, anti-apartheid lawyer <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> was at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alban </ORGANIZATION>'s Anglican Cathedral when it became apparent the women would be unable to assemble there `` It's been a great success for the government,'' he said. `` Roadblocks as far back as <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> -LRB- a black township an hour's drive away -RRB-, barbed wire, security vehicles. The government has made its point.'' A notice tacked to a church door said the government had obtained a court order banning a pre-march service and the march itself. Two trucks mounted with tear gas cannons were parked beside the church. `` It is the same as any other country in the world. People ca n't break the law,'' said Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, standing with riot police outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alban </LOCATION>'s Police briefly detained <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergay </PERSON>, correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and several other journalists. March organizers said police blocked most traffic from black townships around <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Roadblocks were set up at entrances into the city, with officers searching many vehicles and turning back some. At Church Square, the heart of the capital, about 500 white extremists sang Afrikaans hymns and listened to Bible readings as hundreds of blacks watched from the plaza's perimeter. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, leader of the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, assailed <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s proposals to give the black majority a share of political power. If the government capitulates, he said, his group would use force to regain white dominance. One neo-Nazi banner said, `` Apartheid: Solution for AIDS.'' Another demanded the hanging of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and freedom for <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, a white ex-policeman sentenced to death for killing seven blacks in a shooting spree in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> last year. About 40 blacks trying to cross the square were accosted by members of the resistance movement, who wear kahki uniforms with swastika-like symbols. Officers ran through the square, arresting blacks and ordering people out of the area. At least one white extremist also was arrested. Police then allowed a second rally by right-wingers who split from the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The right-wing rallies were convened in response to a protest in the square last week by blacks condemning police brutality. Some blacks had climbed atop a statue of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>, a folk hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners who now control the government.

<HEAD>Thatcher Predicts Success for Gorbachev Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> predicted Saturday that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s sweeping reform agenda will ultimately triumph over the current wave of domestic unrest. `` I believe perestroika is now set on its course and will go through to success,'' the British leader told a news conference following four hours of meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was on a one-day stopover between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The meeting _ which Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> termed a `` milestone'' _ was the fifth between the two leaders since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also was guest at a luncheon hosted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>. The British prime minister was the first major <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> leader to see <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> since this summer's wave of strikes by miners in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and deadly flareups of ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. In her remarks to reporters, she expressed great confidence in the 58-year-old <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader and his program for economic and social reform, saying it `` opens up vistas and horizons not available to the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for some 70 years.'' Asked about current domestic woes faced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drive, she replied that `` anything bold and purposeful will have difficulties to it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s remarks amounted to a vote of confidence in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> leader regarded by many Soviets as hardheaded, practical and not at all favorably disposed to Communism. One of the topics discussed by the two leaders was arms control, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she had been `` in touch'' with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the matter before meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s Hall in the Kremlin. However, she declined to comment on anything <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have told her on a dramatic swing in the Soviet position on a superpower treaty now being negotiated to slash long-range nuclear weapons arsenals. At <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, where Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday the Soviets had dropped demands that a treaty be concluded to limit space-based defenses before a separate pact to slash long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had refused to yield to Soviet demands to trim its `` Star Wars'' space-defense program, a superpower treaty to reduce strategic weapons by 30 to 50 percent had seemed improbable. Asked whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had mentioned the switch in the Soviet bargaining position, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> press room that any announcement on the subject should be made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said only that `` information'' had been exchanged on new developments in superpower arms negotiations. On other disarmament topics, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she left her meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> believing that East and West can reach an agreement reducing coventional weaponry in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by next year. She also said prospects were `` encouraging' for a ban on chemical weapons. Before the leaders met, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet concerns in the talks would include Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s support for Western plans to modernize short-range nuclear weapons. It said the Soviet side also would raise questions about European plans for a single market in 1992, cooperation on ecological problems, and economic joint ventures. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> did not directly address those issues at her half-hour news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said only that the issue of tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` had not been skirted.'' The British leader's personal relationship with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is warm, even though she retains a watchful eye on Soviet military power. Relations between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> slid in May when the British expelled 11 Soviet journalists and diplomats on allegations of spying, and the Soviets retaliated by expelling 11 Britons. But <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that `` in Soviet diplomatic circles, it is believed that these differences should not be viewed as an obstacle to the development of relations between the two nations.''

 A Soviet music student who disappeared before a performance by a <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION> troupe at <ORGANIZATION> Towson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> apparently is seeking to defect, school and Soviet officials said. The 19-year-old musician was reported to be at an undisclosed Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> site Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Towson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said Saturday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed that he is at some location, and that is the only fact we know for certain,'' <ORGANIZATION> Towson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Hoke </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. INS and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials do not comment on cases involving political asylum, officials from both agencies said Saturday. The student, <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaytsev </PERSON>, 19, was one of 20 students and 10 faculty members from the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> State Conservatory who arrived in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The group is scheduled to leave Thursday. <PERSON> Zaytsev </PERSON> failed to show up Friday morning to board a bus that was to take him from a hotel to the school. Soviet and school officials filed a missing person report and were informed later Friday of <PERSON> Zaytsev </PERSON>'s status, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. The vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gintas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhalvys </PERSON>, said through an interpreter that no decision had been made whether to leave without <PERSON> Zaytsev </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> has to think it over, appraise the situation and make up his mind,'' <PERSON> Zhalvys </PERSON> said. Zaytsev plays the balalaika, a triangular, stringed instrument played like a guitar, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zhalvys </PERSON> said a scheduled performance was held as planned Friday and the remainder of the group's schedule would not change. `` This boy had a very small part in our program, so it was very easy to substitute that part,'' <PERSON> Zhalvys </PERSON> said. `` We came here to meet our friends and share the warmth of our hearts, but we never intended to impose on them in this way.''

<TEXT>
 Hawaiian authorities besieged by epidemic use of a smokable crystalline form of the illegal drug methamphetamine have a warning for police on the mainland: Highly addictive `` ice'' is heading their way. `` We're not trying to glamorize this drug, nor are we proud that it's hit <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> first, but we need to alert law enforcement people everywhere and prepare them to handle it,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s narcotics division. Since 1985, there have been 32 deaths related to the crystal meth in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, including 12 in the first six months of 1989, according to Medical Examiner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. They included eight homicides and seven suicides in which the victims had crystal meth in their systems, she said. The drug causes symptoms of psychosis and many users are misdiagnosed as mentally ill, especially schizophrenic. `` This drug makes people bananas. People become violent, they kill themselves, drive crazy, pick fights,'' she said. `` And we just know about the victims; who knows what the assailants were on?'' Since Sept. 5, when drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> unveiled a national anti-drug plan, nearly 50 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies have requested background on crystal meth, <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> said. `` Last week we had a video conference projected to 600 precincts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> during roll call,'' <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> said. `` We had slides on what it looks like, the effects, what symptoms to look for and how it's being packaged and smoked. Although labs making methamphetamine, also known as speed or crank, in its common powdered form are busted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> every year, the crystals smoked here come mainly from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> said. Some mainland authorities familiar with meth do n't even recognize the crystalline form, which looks like rock salt or candy, he said. Crystal meth is already turning up all along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he said. The crystalline form also is known as `` ice,'' `` crystals'' or `` batu.'' It has been smoked here for at least a decade by a small number of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants, but surged to widespread use about two years ago, he said. So far this year, about 400 people have been investigated for the possession or sale of crystal meth, described as cheaper than cocaine, with a longer high than the smokable `` crack'' form of cocaine and more addictive than heroin. `` That's really the crux of the epidemic,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giannasio </PERSON>, medical director of <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s Alcohol and Addictions Program. `` Anytime you can get a drug that causes a very rapid high in a high dosage without having to use a needle, it's going to be a lot more popular. Ice smokers get an energizing high than can last 14 hours, compared with about 15 minutes for crack. But the psychological crash is much worse and can last for days, or until the next smoke, <PERSON> Giannasio </PERSON> said. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> called use here `` epidemic.'' Although no one can say for sure how many people here smoke ice, about 700 people required emergency treatment in the past six months after using it. Ironically, many users switched from crack to crystal meth because they considered it safer; instead, they found themselves addicted from `` practically the first smoke,'' <PERSON> Giannasio </PERSON> said. `` The typical user turns into a paranoid person who goes days without sleep, loses weight, is very suspicious that people are out to get him. They feel like they're going crazy,'' <PERSON> Giannasio </PERSON> said. `` But that's not how it starts out. At first when they use the drug, they feel extremely alert, like they can accomplish anything.'' The drug can also be fatal, leading to strokes, heart attacks and pulmonary edema, which means victims drown in their own bodily fluids, he said. Police Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, head of the juvenile crime division, said Filipino youth gangs control distribution of ice here. The gangs are heavily armed, and violence has escalated recently as rival gangs and even factions of the same group compete for control of the drug. It is commonly sold in `` papers'' containing one hit, or about a tenth of a gram, for $ 50. `` We're just getting the tip of the iceberg,'' he said. `` This stuff is as bad as crack and if it explodes on the national scene without the police being prepared, we're just going to have more violence, more addicts and more dead.''

 Family members on Saturday grieved for their slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorist attack killed 10 military musicians. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleatheroe </PERSON>, whose son <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was killed, joined local residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other military establishments in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal. We had seen it for ourselves. We have always said how easy it would be for anyone to get in ... What could ordinary security men do to stop terrorists?'' she said. British military installations are a frequent target of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the mainly <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982, when 11 servicemen were fatally wounded in bombings in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Shocked residents of Deal gathered outside the barracks to lay flowers in tribute to the young men they called the `` Bandies.'' An 11-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> cadet in full dress uniform marched to the barracks and smartly saluted the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> sign. `` I'm proud of my uniform and I'm proud of all the Marines I knew. I hate the people who did this to them,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, visited the injured and said he was impressed `` by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat them.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said one of the men's main concerns was that their hands would heal properly so they could continue playing their musical instruments. Police investigating the attack were searching a nearby house that had been rented briefly by three men with Irish accents. `` We know when the men arrived and when they left,'' Cmdr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill-Coleman </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said at a news conference. `` It appears the men left several days before the explosion.'' He said the house, which overlooks the barracks recreation center destroyed by the Friday morning blast, was rented by its English owners to three men for two to three weeks. There was no proof the house was an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> hideout, the commander said. `` By virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and the men are Irish, we are very anxious to talk to them,'' he said. Explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were painstakingly examining the house Saturday, and <PERSON> Churchill-Coleman </PERSON> said they would continue for the next two or three days. Police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break between morning band practices were servicemen. Of 22 men injured, 12 remained hospitalized Saturday, five in serious condition. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Friday claimed responsibility for the explosion, which also severely damaged several nearby houses. Police have not determined what caused the blast, but <PERSON> Churchill-Coleman </PERSON> said, `` It would seem to be some form of improvised device using high explosives.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> did not specify how it caused the blast.

 In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where some people still speak of `` simplicity'' and `` tax law'' in the same sentence and $ 100,000 is described as middle income, they've just discovered a new tax outrage. They call it `` the bubble.'' Here's what it means: If the president -LRB- who's paid $ 200,000 -RRB- and your bachelor governor with no income except an $ 85,000 salary win $ 1,000 each in the lottery, the president must pay $ 280 in tax on that additional income and the governor must pay $ 330. To House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., `` the bubble ... is a distortion, it is totally topsy-turvy, upside down of everything that we have ever considered fair, reasonable tax policy. Americans have grown up with the notion that the more you make, the greater portion of each dollar you pay in tax. The stripped-down tax-rate structure enacted in 1986 conflicts with that tradition. Draw a bar graph of traditional income tax rates and you see a series of stairsteps leading upward. But the new law has three steps up and then _ for the really high-income earners _ one step down. That step down is `` the bubble,'' which benefits the nation's richest 600,000 couples and individuals The quirk is at the heart of a steaming tax battle between congressional Democrats and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. As part of their plan to kill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed capital-gains tax cut, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and fellow Democratic leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are trying to burst `` the bubble.'' Eliminating it would take more taxes from the wealthiest and use the money to allow deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all workers and to cut the budget deficit. Here's what `` the bubble'' is all about:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The tax law now has three tax rates: 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent. Every taxpayer pays the lowest rate. For about 80 percent of Americans, it is the only rate they pay; every taxable dollar they earn is taxed at a rate of 15 percent. For a single person, the bottom rate applies to all taxable income _ what is left after deductions and personal exemptions are subtracted _ up to $ 18,550. For a couple filing a joint return, the 15 percent bracket covers taxable income up to $ 30,950. Suppose <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunchbucket </PERSON> has taxable income of $ 18,000 and gets a $ 1,000 pay raise. Step 2 of the rate structure comes into play. The first $ 18,550 is taxed at 15 percent and the additional $ 450 is taxed at 28 percent. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> has moved up into the 28 percent marginal tax bracket, meaning that any additional income _ another pay raise, winning a football pool or interest on a new savings account _ will be taxed at 28 percent. Suppose she's elected football commissioner and gets a $ 70,000 raise. Assuming she has no extra deductions, that pushes her taxable income to $ 89,000 and produces this tax picture: _ $ 18,550 is taxed at 15 percent, resulting in $ 2,782.50 in tax. _ The next $ 26,350 is taxed at 28 percent, or $ 7,378 _ The remaining $ 44,900 is taxed at 33 percent, or $ 14,553 That means a total tax of $ 24,713.50. `` The bubble'' does not affect <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> because her taxable income is under the $ 93,130 level at which it comes into play. But consider <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigbucks </PERSON>, who also is single, makes $ 500,000 a year and has taxable income of $ 400,000. He has to figure his taxes differently. That is because congressional tax-writers, in crafting the 1986 overhaul, decreed that singles with taxable incomes above $ 93,130 and couples above $ 155,320 with no dependents pay a flat 28 percent rate on every penny of taxable income. Also, the very rich get no tax benefit from personal exemptions. So, for Jack: _ The entire $ 400,000 is taxed at 28 percent, for a tax of $ 112,000 _ Losing the tax saving from his $ 2,000 personal exemption adds $ 560 -LRB- 28 percent of $ 2,000 -RRB- to his tax bill That gives <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> a tax liability of $ 112,560. The Democrats want to remove that `` bubble'' _ prevent the 33 percent rate from dropping back to 28 percent. They would tax all of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s taxable income over $ 44,900 at 33 percent. That would mean: _ $ 18,550 taxed at 15 percent, a tax of $ 2,782.50. _ The next $ 26,350 taxed at 28 percent, or $ 7,378 _ The remaining $ 355,100 taxed at 33 percent, or $ 117,183 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> would have a total tax bill of $ 127,343.50 _ or $ 14,783.50 more than under present law.

 Lake for sale. Some maintenance required. Best offer. It's not your average auction, but on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Hoosac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> goes on the block as lawyers try to liquidate the last remaining, and already fairly liquid, asset of a defunct printing works. And shorefront residents are not eager to see it fall into the hands of a developer. `` We're selling this thing as is, where is. Whatever we have you get,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>, a lawyer with the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> firm handling the sale, the last item in an 8-year-old bankruptcy case involving the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Print </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. Part of <PERSON> Hoosac </PERSON>'s shoreline runs through the Berkshires town of <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION>, and residents there are worried. `` Our concern is if it is a private buyer, what does he have in mind for us?'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Hoosac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's what people in the big cities like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> dream about. It's very picturesque, quiet, Arcadian.'' Despite its scenic qualities, town officials say the lake would be a bad buy because of the costs of weeding, expected to be $ 31,000 this year, and because it includes an aging, 120-year-old dam. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said he hopes Monday's auction will be a flop, proving the lake does n't have commercial potential and possibly opening the door for its donation to the town or state. `` I personally do n't think anyone's going to be interested,'' said Selectman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Polastri </PERSON>. The town does n't plan to make a bid, but `` all of us are going to be there,'' he said. <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> had been paying $ 750 a year for an annual lease to use the lake, <PERSON> Polastri </PERSON> said. `` What the town would do after the sale is anybody's guess at this point,'' he said. About five years ago, the state offered about $ 115,000 for the 566-acre lake, but was unable to reach an agreement on price, said state Sen. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>. With the state in a budget crisis, the money is n't there this year, he said. <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> says the property, which includes about 50 acres of land, might be good for someone who wants to build a resort. The lake dates to the 1860s, when manufacturers banded together to buy land, dam the <LOCATION> Hoosac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and create water power for their mills. In 1912 the <ORGANIZATION> Hoosac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was formed to oversee management of the water. <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Print </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> was the last remaining shareholder of that company, <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> said. Principals of the company are no longer involved in the case, he said. Terms of the auction will be outlined Monday, but the auctioneer has announced that a $ 25,000 deposit is required, <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> said. `` I have no idea what we're going to sell it for,'' he said. A sale would be subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> and any proceeds would be divided among unsecured creditors of the print works.

 Just how <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and his lesser-known friend <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> invented cubism eight decades ago is the topic of a major exhibit opening Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. The show, described by the museum as the first attempt to examine cubism `` through an in-depth concentration on its core,'' deals with the artists' work between 1907 and 1914. `` During the cubist years both artists were at their best when they were closest to one another,'' exhibition organizer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> writes in the catalog. `` Cubism as we know it was a vision that neither artist could have realized alone.'' A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> critic described the exhibit as `` the show of the decade.''

<TEXT>
 Finance officials of the nation's seven largest industrial nations gathered Saturday amid growing evidence their efforts to stabilize world currency markets have become ineffective. In their first meeting since April, the officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ are reviewing this year's rise in the value of the dollar, which is endangering the improvement in the American trade deficit. A strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaper for American consumers. The trade gap shrank by 22 percent last year and has continued to improve this year, although at only about half of 1988's rate. When the finance officials and central bank governors of the seven nations last met, they agreed to try to curb a further increase in the dollar. They've backed the rhetoric with heavy intervention in currency markets, the process in which central banks buy and sell dollars in an attempt to influence dollar prices. But even though the central banks have sold billions, the price of the dollar continued to rise. Analysts say intervention is becoming less effective because government sales amount to an increasingly smaller fraction of the mushrooming volume of daily currency trading. Since the last G-7 meeting, the dollar has appreciated by about 10 percent against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the West German mark. The dollar on Friday bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks, well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading range sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks. In advance of Saturday's meeting, conducted in private, analysts were expecting the G-7 to do little more than issue a vague communique expressing concern about the dollar's strength. However, economists were holding out the possibility that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> may show more willingness in the months ahead to raise or lower interest rates as a means of influencing exchange markets. An increase in Japanese and West German interest rates would make investing in those countries more attractive and would thus raise the value of their currencies. A cut in interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would push the dollar lower. `` The fact of the matter is intervention does not work in the long run,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> DRI-McGraw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` The only long-term solution really is to change monetary policy.'' Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, speculated that the Japanese and West German officials would agree at Saturday's meeting to raise their interest rates if the dollar threatened to rise above 2.00 marks and 150 yen. `` There is also the possibility, and I'd underscore the word ` possibility,' of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loosening'' in the fourth quarter, he said. `` I think the G-7 is going to speak softly but carry a big stick on the dollar this time.'' In addition to the narrow question of exhange rates, finance officials were expected to discuss the broader issue of economic coordination. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to stimulate consumer demand in their countries as a means of cutting their trade surpluses and reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in turn, is being urged to reignite efforts to curb its budget deficit, which is believed to contribute to the trade deficit. The Third World debt problem was also expected to be discussed by the officials. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who hosted the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, has been promoting a new strategy to relieve developing nations of their crushing $ 1.3 trillion debt burden. However, the decision by three large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks last week to add $ 4 billion to their loss reserves for Third World debt is raising concern that the banks will be unwilling to make the new loans needed by developing countries for economic growth. The Group of Seven talks were being held before the start of the annual meetings this week of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and its sister lending organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The finance ministers and central banks governors arrived in limousines at the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the White House, before lunch. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> session was preceded by a Group of Five meeting _ the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> excluding <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> met one-on-one with <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, the new Japanese minister of finance, and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>, the French finance minister. It was <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>.

 Guerrilla forces have seized territory surrounding a gem-rich western town, taking advantage of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the defense minister said Saturday. It is the first government acknowledgment that the resistance has captured territory in a battle seen as a crucial test of the Cambodian army, which is fighting for once without Vietnamese troop support. Gen. Tea Banh also said that less than 20,000 government soldiers have been killed or wounded since January 1979, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded and installed <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s present government. `` I am speaking to you frankly. We do not claim that we control all of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>,'' the general said of the ruby-rich town near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s ruby mines are centered in a 16-square-mile area near <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. The general said <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> troops have seized parts of the mining center. A Soviet military observer said the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have thrown their best troops into the battle for <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. He said fighting was fierce and most residents had fled or been evacuated. The observer, who requested anonymity, spoke in Russian to an East European reporter who made his comments available to The Associated Press. Tea Banh told a news conference that soldiers are exchanging mostly mortar and artillery shells. But he said the fighting is not a serious security threat to the government, which has been supported by Vietnamese troops since the invasion that ended a bloody reign of terror by the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` Only some parts of the forest have been captured and most of the district is in our hands,'' he said. He indicated the government is willing to hold another round of peace talks with the guerrilla coalition it is battling. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Saturday, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> announced his mediation had won agreement from Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and leaders of the three guerrilla factions to resume peace talks some time in the future. `` We would like to continue with our national reconciliation,'' Tea Banh said. `` It is very important for us to get peace _ peace that is for the sake of the people of our country. ... If this peace comes along with the return of the genocidal regime -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, it can not be accepted.'' The government refuses to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to take part in a transitional government. <ORGANIZATION> Non-Communist </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla leaders say they prefer to share power with the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> than fight it. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of people in attempts at an agrarian revolution in 1975-1978. Also Saturday, Deputy Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Nhim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanda </PERSON> told Vietnamese troops celebrating their withdrawal that <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> troops will be able to defend the country. `` During the 10 years our Vietnamese comrades have been in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> military has improved step-by-step,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> gathering of Vietnamese forces from three Cambodian provinces. The guerrillas have their bases near the Thai border, both in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and receive the bulk of their arms via <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They hope in the <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> battle to secure a base deeper inside the country as well as revenue from the ruby mines. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says the last of 26,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will depart Tuesday, ending involvement in a war that took lives of 25,000 Vietnamese troops. Guerrilla leaders say the pullout is a ploy and that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> is hiding troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Tea Banh said about 10,000 Cambodian soldiers have been killed or wounded in combat and another 10,000 died or were hurt by sickness or landmines.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister on Saturday denounced <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ban on a dissident group, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s former intelligence chief reportedly said he favors change in his Communist homeland. The East German <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday outlawed the fledgling Neues Forum, pro-democracy group, saying it harbored `` anti-state'' policies. Activists say the group has grown from 30 to more than 3,000 members in two weeks. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> denounced the East German government's action. `` Can it be anti-state when people want to make contributions toward reforms of state and society? Why are they being shoved into illegality, instead of being listened to and taken seriously?'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in a speech in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION>. His speech was made available to reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in advance. Neues Forum is among a host of pro-democracy groups that has sprung up across the country as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aging leaders continue to reject Kremlin-style reforms despite the emigration of thousands of East Germans to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent weeks. Neues Forum leaders have vowed to challenge the government's action in court There have been signs of disunity over the question of reforms within <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with some East German officials conceding in recent days that changes are necessary. A West German newspaper on Saturday quoted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s former head of intellingence, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, as saying `` changes are important and belong to the huge theme of Socialist renewal.'' The Sueddeutsche Zeiting also quoted the former spymaster, who retired in 1987 and still lives in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as saying it is important to `` think over the causes'' of the exodus of thousands of East Germans to the West `` and also speak about it.'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> stands on `` solid foundations'' and that `` we can look into the future with optimism,'' the newspaper reported. The Hamburg-based newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> pastor <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON>, who is also a leading pro-democracy activist, as saying many people within the East German Communist Party favor reforms. <PERSON> Eppelman </PERSON> said the banning of Neues Forum is the `` futile attempt ... of a small leadership group'' within the party to `` head off historic developments that are to come,'' the newspaper said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is no longer a monolithic block.

 Flashing the thumbs-up sign, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> today moved through the final rounds of talks to put the finishing touches on a series of arms control agreements. The most significant step was the Soviets' dropping their insistence that curbs on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars missile defense be completed before a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. That appeared to break an impasse over talks to slash long-range nuclear weapons arsenals, said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. A senior official traveling with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are expected to announce that a summit will be held within the first six months of 1990, mostly likely in the spring. The two both flashed the thumbs-up sign as they strolled briefly through the woods before resuming their discussions. `` We are working very hard,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The announcement that the Soviets had dropped a major demand came Friday night as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also neared agreement on an accord to open each other's underground nuclear tests to on-site inspection. The foreign ministers began their final talks at a Rocky Mountain lodge today, with expectations high that they would set a target date for a summit between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The foreign secretaries also made progress toward several other arms control agreements they were expected to sign before heading to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sunday for a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> meeting. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition that he not be further identified, said the Soviet agreement to separate negotiations on the Star Wars missile defense system and START talks breaks a four-year deadlock on the issue. `` Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said they had dropped their linkage between completing and implementing in START and achieving a defense in space accord,'' said the official. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official stressed `` the need to clarify'' the Soviet position, but said, `` this looks like a positive development.'' Many lesser points of disagreement remain in the proposed 450-page START agreement, but resolution of the space defense issue could accelerate the START pact, the official said. Until now, said the official, `` the Soviets have said they would not want to enter into a START agreement until there was an understanding on defense in space.'' A Soviet spokesman, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Malakhov </PERSON>, said there would be no immediate Soviet response to the American comments. The agreement on on-site inspections would clear the way for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of two U.S.-Soviet treaties that were signed in 1974 and 1976. The pacts have been observed by both sides, but they have never agreed on how to monitor them. Details on the agreements were left to be resolved after Friday's session, said a second senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official The other issues that were ready or near completion were: _ A protocol on determining the size of superpower chemical weapons stockpiles, to assist completion of a multilateral convention to stop production of such substances _ An umbrella agreement covering verification of means of counting weapons to be eliminated under START _ A pact under which the two sides would give each other prior notification of strategic exercises involving weapons which in wartime would threaten the other _ A statement to expand the superpower human rights dialogue from emigration issues to cover revisions in the Soviet criminal code, occupational health and the environment _ A pact to lift the so-called `` Ice Curtain'' that since 1948 has prevented Alaskan Eskimos from visiting their distant relations in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> Despite the friendly atmosphere, the two sides remained divided over the major negotiation before them, START. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> presented the Americans with what one Soviet official called `` exhilarating'' proposals to clear a main obstacle to START, an agreement on adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That pact curbs development of space-based defenses such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan is formally known. The proposals dealt with space tests of potential weapons, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators said they did not mark a sharp departure from previous Soviet ideas. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most of the Baker-Shevardnadze session was devoted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints that the Soviets were boosting military shipments to allies involved in wars in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Asked whether <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> promised to curtail the arms flow, the official said, `` Each side has a more complete understanding of some of the other's concerns.'' Disagreement over regional conflicts, however, likely would be overshadowed by the five agreements. Under the protocol on testing-site inspections, Soviet inspectors would monitor the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> test site and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors would observe tests in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors using a system known as CORRTEX would be notified in advance of a test explosion at the Soviets' Semipalatinsk site. They would drop a cable into a nearby four-foot-wide hole. The force of the explosion would be measured by the speed at which the cable was smashed. Under the 1974 and 1976 treaties, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet underground nuclear blasts _ the only kind not outlawed _ are limited to 150 kilotons.

 <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>'s death at age 101 marked the end of an era in American music, but his legacy lives on in his music, friends and admirers said Saturday. `` Just knowing he was there'' was an inspiration, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, a composer and cabaret performer who had organized Christmas Eve serenades outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> town house for more than 20 years. Upon hearing of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s death, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> said, he and three friends went to the reclusive songwriter's home. `` We just stood there and cried a lot and sang, ` I'll be loving you, always,''' he said. He said he planned to organize a larger, candlelight vigil for Sunday night. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who wrote `` Always,'' `` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' `` White Christmas,'' and more than 1,000 other songs in his long career, died in his sleep at his home about 5:30 p.m. Friday. A spokesman said the funeral would be private, but plans for a memorial service would be announced. Broadway theaters planned to dim their lights Saturday night in honor of the man who wrote the scores for 19 shows, including `` Annie Get Your Gun'' and `` Call Me Madam.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was a charter member, planned to take out a full-page testimonial in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said former president <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>, which organized an all-star Carnegie Hall salute to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for his 100th birthday last year, also planned a memorial. `` I think he's the greatest songwriter the world has ever had,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. Composer-conductor <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s music has become `` part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined a crowd of thousands Saturday to sing `` God Bless America.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was speaking at a luncheon of Roman Catholic lawyers. Later, he said in a statement: `` Very few people have come to touch and move the soul of a nation, reflecting its spirit and traditions. Mr. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> ranks among such people, a composer, a legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of our nation.'' Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who as an actor was featured along with <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s songs in the flag-waving 1943 movie musical `` This is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' said in a statement: `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.'' Actress-dancer <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said working with <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and her longtime partner <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> in `` Top Hat,'' was `` like heaven,'' referring to the lyrics of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Oscar-nominated `` Cheek to Cheek,'' which was featured in the classic 1935 film. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON>, a salesman at <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> Music in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> sheet music is still in demand. The nearly 50-year-old `` White Christmas'' is the store's No. 1 seller during the holidays, he said. `` I personally went up to his office last Christmas and picked up 500 copies because it had gone so fast,'' <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON> said. `` He wrote songs for the people,'' said opera singer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter. He was not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for melody and words that was precious.'' `` There'll never be another <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. It's an era that's gone.

 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces clashed with mortars and machine guns in the hills overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Saturday, shattering a truce that had brought thousands of hopeful refugees flooding back to their ravaged city. Police reported three people were wounded in the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> when mortar rounds exploded in residential neighborhoods. Officials said the clashes appeared to be limited. But residents who have seen several cease-fires collapse were anxious. A newly formed committee made up of officials from the various factions met at a horse track on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> and announced that shipping blockades imposed by both sides would be lifted immediately. The Arab League envoy, <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, told reporters that the group agreed `` to work immediately on consolidating a cease-fire'' and to reopen <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport, the country's only public airport which has been closed since March 12. But three hours later, the fighting flared. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio: `` These are unnecessary setbacks. I'm getting in touch with the members of the committee to curb this deterioration.'' The committee's next meeting was scheduled for Sunday. The clashes were the first reported since 10 p.m. Friday. Sporadic bursts of automatic weapons fire and occasional rocket-propelled grenade explosions had been heard throughout the day along the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>. After rejecting numerous other truce attempts by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, both Christians and Moslems agreed last week to adhere to the latest peace proposal. The committee comprises representatives from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, the rival Moslem army command of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s two militia allies, the Shiite Moslem Amal and the <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But the Syrians were not represented. Although their army has been the main force fighting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops, they claim they were not involved and that the committee is a matter for the Lebanese only. All but 150,000 of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million population had fled the shelling for safer areas. Buoyed by the glimmer of hope that peace may be at hand, tens of thousands of people jammed the highways Saturday leading into the city from <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where many Moslems stayed. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatab </PERSON> said that he, his wife and six children had lived in one room they rented in the south <LOCATION> Lebanonese </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> for the last six months. `` Can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half a year?'' he said as he was caught in a traffic jam at <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts. `` Some of the time we even had relatives, neighbors and friends who escaped with nowhere to go.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, cars were bumper-to-bumper on highways leading into the Christian heartland from the north. By police count, 929 people have been killed and 2,738 wounded, nearly all of them civilians, since the bombardments began March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed a blockade on ports south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> operated by Druse and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militias. The Syrians and their allies retaliated by shelling the Christians' 310-square-mile homeland enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and blockading it. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> initially rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plan because the security committee would not include the Syrians. But he changed his mind Friday after pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plan seeks a political settlement of the civil war in which more than 150,000 have been killed. It calls for the 73 surviving members of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 99-seat parliament to meet outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to formulate political reforms that would distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> have dominated the government, parliament, the judiciary and army since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943 At that time they were considered the majority. Although there has been no census since 1932, Moslems now form an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million population. Hardline Maronites, who are mostly pro-European, have resisted surrendering their traditional privileges, which include the presidency, for fear of being swamped by the Moslems. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had gambled that Western powers, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would come to his rescue when he launched his `` war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians. But that did not happen and it was a major blow when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> closed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Sept. 6 after he accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of supporting the Syrians.

<TEXT>
 After years in the thick of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s struggle to build Soviet socialism, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> says he knows a place where the average working man is happy and secure That place, he is telling his Soviet supporters, is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The silver-haired populist, who has spent the last two years irritating President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Soviet establishment, returned from a nine-city tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday to face two pressing controversies. One was resolved within days when the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda publicly apologized for reprinting an article alleging <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> boozed and spent his way across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The other surrounds his comments about life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, reminiscent of tales that have drawn immigrants to the New World for generations. The comments were rosier than many Americans would venture. They are bound to be noticed by party officials who question <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s loyalty to Communist ideals, whether he has any firm program to cure the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic ills, and wonder whether his long-term plan is to elbow out <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` Their supermarkets have 30,000 food items,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told 20,000 supporters Friday in his first public appearance since returning. `` You ca n't imagine it. It makes the people feel secure.'' In order to understand what they're missing and therefore change their own society, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said, `` at least 100 million Soviets must pass through the American school of supermarkets. The leaders must be first.'' The 58-year-old Siberian who came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1985 and was named by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to run the capital's party organization, also cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bounty in the popular weekly Arguments and Facts. The point is obvious for Soviets struggling through shortages of items such as cigarettes, meat, matches and soap in the fifth year of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Americans, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told his supporters, `` know how to work. They enjoy life, and they are humane. They live very well.'' He pointed a finger at the Soviet approach to building a socialist society: `` Our decades-old slogan to ` Catch up with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and leave it behind' was of great damage to us because it exists for itself, for the sake of prestige, not for the people. `` We will never catch up with them and never leave them behind and we do not need to strive for this. We must strive for a better life for our people.'' In both his address to the crowd in <LOCATION> Zelenograd </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and his newspaper interview, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> too has its problems, primarily unemployment. But he glanced over them. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> says he supports <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s restructuring program, but differs on tactics. He says conservatives are keeping <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from moving faster and warns <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program is losing steam. He told the crowd the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should work for more favorable trade agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, invite <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers to till Soviet land on long-term leases and allow Americans to build 1 million apartments and sell them to whoever can afford them. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s barbed criticisms have not been lost on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who fired him as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief in November 1987 after he questioned the party's policies and pace of reform. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> subsequently was stripped of his candidate membership of the ruling party Politburo, but has become something of a folk hero for his attacks on privileges for party and government officials. In March, Muscovites gave him 89 percent of the vote for the capital's seat in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Zelenograd </LOCATION> crowd he thought Pravda's publication of the article alleging misconduct was an effort to help force him off the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at an upcoming meeting. But Pravda itself acknowledged doubts about the accuracy of the story it reprinted from the Italian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>, and no such move emerged. However, according to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, his criticisms did come up. `` At the end of the plenum, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says, ` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He talks about how good it is in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we all were criticized by him, including we <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and the Presidium which I head,''' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the crowd. `` I told him, ` Right, that's the way it was,''' he added. The crowd applauded.

<HEAD>ACLU Challenges Arkansas Abortion Notification Law in Federal Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' law requiring notification of parents 48 hours before a minor undergoes an abortion interferes with a doctor's right to practice medicine and a woman's right to the operation, a lawsuit contends. Among the plaintiffs is a 16-year-old girl in her 11th week of pregnancy. The 1989 law also assigns jurisdiction for granting exceptions to the law to <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' probate courts, which under state law have no jurisdiction over minors, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> alleged in the suit filed Friday in federal court. The lawsuit seeks to declare the law unconstitutional, and asks for an immediate injunction against enforcing the law. However, no hearing date has been scheduled. The law was passed last spring, before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on July 3 that gave states more leeway on restricting abortions through such things as banning them at public hospitals. The high court is due to consider the constitutionality other types of abortion restrictions in the coming term, which begins next month. Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Engstrom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, who filed the suit along with attorney <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` Mac'' Norton of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, said he asked Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> on Friday to allow an abortion for the 16-year-old, identified only as <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>. `` He refused. He told us to take our best shot. I think that was insensitive,'' <PERSON> Engstrom </PERSON> said. The suit, filed later Friday, names <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and the state as defendants. `` I'm ready to defend this law; I believe it's constitutional,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, adding that he did not believe the plaintiffs had tried to use all legal procedures outlined in the law. Cooperating in the lawsuit is Planned Parenthood of <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>, which offers abortion counseling. Another plaintiff is Dr. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, who performs abortions. `` Parental notice is unjustified because it increases the medical risk to the teen-ager,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Libbe </PERSON>, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. The lawsuit contends that the law places an undue burden on the teen-ager's right to an abortion, and an excessive burden on either the teen-ager or the doctor in locating both parents. There is an exception if the whereabouts of one of the parents is unknown. In addition, the law is so vague that a physician could be subject to criminal penalties, yet can not understand what the law requires of him, the lawsuit said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and two pro-Iranian terrorist groups threatened Saturday to punish <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s `` pagan regime'' for beheading 16 Shiite Moslems accused of bombing Mecca during a pilgrimage to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejected Saudi allegations that the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> trained and equipped the 16 Kuwaitis to carry out the bombings in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamanei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, as saying the consequences of the executions Thursday `` will plague'' the Saudis. He branded the beheadings `` another crime at the hands of the rulers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> ... These dear martyrs were killed for the crime of supporting the Islamic republic and their love'' for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died June 3 The radio quoted Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying: `` The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government, with baseless allegations, is striving to create divisions within the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> nation. This is against the interests of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.'' The executions of the Shiite Moslems, members of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s dominant religion, appeared to scuttle recent moves aimed at restoring relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, where Sunni Moslems predominate. The two branches of Islam have feuded for centuries. The Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, also vowed in a statement published in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to avenge the execution of the Kuwaitis. <PERSON> Hezollah </PERSON>, the umbrella group thought to hold 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said the executions were `` a terrorist act and an organized crime. `` The deep grudge that rules the actions of the pagan regime ... will be a motive for avenging the blood of the oppressed.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said a similar threat was made by a group calling itself the Organization of the Islamic Revolution in the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. In June, the group claimed responsibility for the slaying of an Egyptian driver working for the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Several Saudi diplomats have also been killed in recent months around the world. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a statement by the group saying the executions `` will further speed up retaliatory moves by Moslems and strengthen their determination to eradicate this unholy root from the most sacred land on earth.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also quoted an unidentified Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying that recorded confessions of the convicted Kuwaitis broadcast by Saudi television were `` false allegations disseminated by the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government. In their confessions, the <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON> said they had received sabotage training from Iranians in a remote area of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. They also said two Iranians at the embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> provided them with explosives and timing devices. The spokesman blamed the attacks on `` mercenaries working for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> ... to suppress Moslems who reject Saudi control of the holy shrines.'' `` With the execution of a number of oppressed Kuwaiti Moslems the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> regime has further exposed its anti-Islamic nature,'' the spokesman said. He urged the world's Moslems `` to break their silence over these atrocities.'' Otherwise, he said, `` The Islamic world will continue to witness torture and bloodshed at the hands of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> rulers during the hajj,'' the annual Moslem pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. On July 10, two bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, birthplace of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s founder, killing a Pakistani man and wounding 16 other pilgrims. Relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> were severly strained in July 1987 when more than 400 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims, were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> during the pilgrimage. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> severed relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in April 1988, citing subversion and terrorism. The Saudis imposed a limit on the number of pilgrims in 1988 in an effort to improve security. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> boycotted the pilgrimage because its quota was cut from the usual 150,000 to less than 50,000.

 On Folly Beach, a house sat in the road; in some places, houses had disappeared. And on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the Isle of Palms, Hurricane Hugo had damaged virtually every building, an aerial tour showed Saturday. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> tore a wide path along the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast, but areas less than 20 miles from some of the worst-hit areas appeared unscathed. About 680,000 people live along <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 220 miles of coast. Over <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and, about 150 miles to the south, over the islands of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fripp </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, there were few telltale signs of Friday's storm aside from boarded-up houses and trees on the ground. <LOCATION> Edisto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, suffered serious erosion when water rushed over the road and under most seaward houses, many of which rest on supports. No homes were leveled, however. But heading north, a band of devastation stretched for 90 miles from <LOCATION> Folly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, five miles southeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As many as 30 percent of the homes on Folly Beach had either disappeared or were uninhabitable, and it appeared that all the others had suffered some damage from the rains and wind above 100 mph. One house had been tossed onto a road. From the air above <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> suburb that lies on the inland side of Folly Beach, most of the roads and homes could be seen in areas that once were hidden by thick woods. But the damage to buildings was less than on Folly Beach. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island and the Isle of Palms bore the brunt of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s fury, and every structure on both islands appeared damaged Many houses were buckled and had their supports ripped away, and sometimes nothing was left but a roof or pilings in the sand. Several houses were in roads, roofs were peeled off, and trees were uprooted. The <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON>, the swing bridge that links the two islands to the mainland, was twisted and tilted so that one end dipped 35 feet down to the Intracoastal Waterway. At the Wild Dunes marina on the Isle of Palms, about 40 boats were blown across the shore and heaped into a pile. At Folly Beach, other boats were stacked up between a bridge and condominium project. Just to the north, homes in the Bull's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> area also were heavily damaged, and a marina in <LOCATION> Winyah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> had disappeared. Massive oceanfront homes in the wealthy residential community of <LOCATION> Debidue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> fell from their pilings to the surf, and wind had ripped off the fronts of houses, exposing rooms. More than three-quarters of the homes were damaged. On <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, at least three homes were across or in the creek that separates the island from the mainland. Some had been moved more than 100 yards. A channel of water approximately 20 feet wide had sliced the island in two. Roads in <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were covered with sand as far as three blocks from the beach. <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> suffered severe erosion that exposed brown soil beneath the beach sand, but wind damage was minor. And an amusement park roller coaster appeared intact.

<TEXT>
 A Solidarity journalist was named Saturday to run <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s state-owned television and radio, removing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control of the powerful broadcast media for the first time since World War II. Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON>, 57, a specialist in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs and a former political prsoner. The choice to head radio and television was the major remaining question mark in <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government. The post will not retain its Cabinet rank, reflecting the new government's view that there should be nothing like an `` information minister'' trying to shape public opinion. `` TV is the mass medium that lied the most,'' said <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON>, a Solidarity senator who negotiated media reform with the Communists during their historic negotiations earlier this year. Gaining control of the electronic media was a non-negotiable point for Solidarity during talks to form the East bloc's first government not led by Communists. `` The government wants to tell the truth and enable freedom of speech for all sections of public opinion,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> told parliament Sept. 12. `` The right of access to radio and televison must be equal to all,'' he said. `` Gone are the times of limiting the freedom of Polish journalists.'' The post was held since April 17 _ the same day legal status was restored to Solidarity after a seven-year ban _ by <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, who as government spokesman aggressively dueled with Solidarity when it was in opposition. <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> will meet with Urban on Sunday and begin his new duties Monday, his wife, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. She said <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> was outside the city and could not be reached for comment. The power of the mass media has been carefully guarded by the Communists since they came to power in the late 1940s. Poles eager for even a glimpse of the outside world are hooked on television. Nonetheless, they have railed against what was shown _ riots and mayhem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example _ and what was n't: Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, for seven years after the 1981 martial-law crackdown. After martial law was imposed, journalists were required to go through a `` verification'' of their loyalty to Communist authorities. Many were forced out. At the talks that led to restoration of Solidarity's legal status, <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> said, union negotiators concluded that `` for Communists the world created by television, the artificial world, is more important than the real world.'' <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON>, who was jailed along with thousands of others after martial law, has no significant experience in television. But he is a respected journalist known for his admiration of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies. There has been considerable debate over the new structure of state television. The pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> has been running a back-page forum under the headline, `` What kind of television?'' Some have suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> be given 45 minutes a week on TV _ just what <PERSON> Solidarty </PERSON> got when it won limited access to the airwaves in April. Control of broadcasting likely will be transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> to parliament under the committee headed by <PERSON> Drawicz </PERSON> and including deputy chairmen from its allied parties and the Communists. The committee will be run publicly, <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> said, unlike the past when the names of all members but the chairman were kept secret. Viewers say news reports have become more even-handed in recent months, and one satirical program even poked fun at communsit President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> _ something that would have been unthinkable a year ago.

<HEAD>Judges Declares Sentencing Law Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has struck down a portion of federal sentencing law as unconstitutional, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave prosecutors too much _ and judges too little _ authority to decide prison sentences. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON> acted in a case involving a woman who cooperated with the government and gave key testimony in a drug case. The prosecution did not recommend a reduced sentence for this cooperation and the 1987 law gave the judge no option but to impose the full sentence. Since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted only federal prosecutors the power to request a sentence reduction, <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON> said Thursday, the executive branch of government has more authority in sentencing than the judiciary and that imbalance must be corrected. The sentencing guidelines were enacted to ensure uniform sentencing among judges nationwide so that all criminals are treated fairly no matter what part of the country they are in. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the decision is still being reviewed, and no decision has been made on an appeal to the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's been a very strong tool for effecting cooperation,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` It's certainly my sense that that's exactly the way <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended it to be used.'' <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> violated the separation of power doctrine. If the government lets the decision stand, it will apply only in <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON>'s courtroom unless other judges around the country follow his lead. If the government appeals and loses again, <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON>'s ruling would be the law in the entire 7th Circuit, which includes all of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON> acted at the request of attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, who was representing a woman sentenced to four years in prison after being convicted of cocaine conspiracy charges. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> argued his client, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, 26, should get a reduced sentence based on her cooperation in convicting two other drug dealers. `` This ` girl' helped the government a great deal, at a great personal risk, and her cooperation resulted in the conviction of a drug kingpin in central Illinois,'' <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said the judge ca n't consider that in sentencing unless the prosecution agrees. That power should be equally shared by the prosecution and the judiciary.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said he was unable to recommend a reduced sentence because Ms. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> had not gone under cover to help convict <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Blackie'' Spears or <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON> on drug dealing charges, as required by regional policy. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> told the court Ms. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> probably placed herself and her family in jeopardy by cooperating completely with the prosecution. `` There's no question that -LRB- <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s testimony -RRB- was a significant factor in the <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON> trial,'' <PERSON> Mihm </PERSON> said, adding that the 17-year prison term given to <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> `` would have been considerably less'' without her cooperation. He said those facts should have been considered by the prosecutors and warranted a reduced sentence.

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pressman who killed eight former co-workers in a printing plant before shooting himself felt worthless and isolated, attempted suicide before and mentioned hurting other people, hospital records show. `` Here we are dealing with a man who had a long history of chronic mental illness and chronic mental depression,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Greathouse </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was `` oftentimes tortured, oftentimes seeking help from various psychiatrists and doctors wherever he could find it, but never really finding any peace with his treatment or any of his psychiatric therapies. `` This man was tortured by what he felt,'' <PERSON> Greathouse </PERSON> said Friday. The records show that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, 47, fought mental illness and depression for the past 11 years. He was beset by racing thoughts, sleeplessness, tremors, blurred vision, confusion, anxiety, headaches, dizziness and anger, according to the records. On Sept. 14, <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> fatally wounded eight people at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and injured 12 with an AK-47 assault rifle before killing himself with a pistol. Nine people remained hospitalized Saturday. The records show that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had difficulty concentrating and once could n't recall his own address. He felt isolated from others, and he sometimes felt worthless. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> told psychiatrists he had thoughts of taking his own life and had acted on those thoughts 12 to 15 times. He took pills, clogged his car's exhaust pipe and tried to hang himself. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, who was placed on long-term mental disability in February, also had occasional thoughts of hurting other people, the records indicate. He had mentioned his wife's ex-husband and his foreman at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> as possible targets. <PERSON> Greathouse </PERSON> is trying along with police to reconstruct <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s life and illness Under court order, <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> turned over the records Friday to <PERSON> Greathouse </PERSON>, who released a summary of the material. <PERSON> Greathouse </PERSON> said that: _ <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was voluntarily admitted to hospitals at least three times for psychiatric treatment between 1978 and 1987 _ The hospital records reflect a man who withdrew from other people and had difficulty with on-the-job stress, once declining a promotion and a $ 4-an-hour raise because he found the job `` too stressful and demanding. _ <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> complained that exposure to toluene in his 17 years at the company caused memory loss, dizziness and `` blackout spells. <PERSON> Greathouse </PERSON> said the records suggested that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> posed a threat to himself and others. `` I think they knew this man was quite ill mentally but were still hopefully wishing their treatment might work,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Saturday became the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic to declare itself `` sovereign,'' meaning decrees from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> do n't have to be obeyed if they conflict with local law, local journalists reported. The vote by the Supreme Soviet parliament in the mostly Moslem republic in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> also indirectly reasserts <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s right to rule <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Armenian enclave that has belonged to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since the 1920s <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> put <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> under its direct administration in February because of ethnic violence that has now lasted for 19 months. But the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> parliament earlier this month rejected that step as an infringement on its right to govern territory granted it by the Soviet Constitution. The law on sovereignty approved Saturday by the republic's Supreme Soviet establishes the `` integrity, indivisibility and inviolability'' of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s territory, said <PERSON> Arif </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, an independent journalist He spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the republic's capital. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> also was declared `` independent'' in all matters except those it delegates voluntarily to national authorities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> said. The parliament reportedly rejected as illegal an assembly of ethnic Armenians from <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> who in August again voted to secede from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and join <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> was the first of the 15 Soviet republics to challenge <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s rule by declaring the republic `` sovereign'' last November. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership immediately rejected the move as unconstitutional, but government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> policy have since been altered to give more powers to the republics. Since President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985, ethnic regions throughout their nation have increasingly asserted their independence and embraced their nationalist heritage, outgrowths of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s more open society.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers met Saturday to try to close ranks and agree on whether they can boost their crude production without upsetting the oil market. The officials of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries held their first round of talks in a luxury hotel in this picturesque Swiss city. They met for nearly three hours behind closed doors to thrash out a range of issues, including a long-term strategy and plans for marking their 30th anniversary in 1990. But they decided to huddle privately before returning late Sunday afternoon to take a look at the world oil market and decide a course of action for the last three months of the year. The ministers are divided over whether the cartel should raise its output by 500,000 barrels a day or so in the October-December period. Some worried a pickup in output would hurt oil prices and their countries' needed revenues from crude sales. The cartel's secretary-general, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, said the ministers had eight items on their agenda, ranging from plotting a long-term strategy to marking the organization's 30th anniversary in 1990. But the most heated discussions will no doubt center on the question of whether the cartel should raise its output by 500,000 barrels a day or so in the last three months of the year. Led by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, the cartel already is producing well over its production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day for the last half of the year. Without reining in the overproducers, analysts say, prices could slip a bit with increased supply. Gasoline prices at the pump would likely be little affected, though. Even before the talks began, the ministers were divided over their next step. One side appeared to feel the market was steady enough and consumer demand strong enough to absorb an increase. <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, petroleum minister for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, said that `` there are some indications'' the market could absorb an increase. A final decision, he said, `` depends on the market.'' `` If the market is allowing that, we will do it. If not ... we will not increase the ceiling,'' he told reporters before the start of the evening meeting. The other set of ministers clearly wanted the cartel to concentrate on getting prices up to the its target of $ 18 a barrel. They feared higher production would weaken prices. `` We hope that everybody will come down ... with what he is producing so we can get to 18,'' said Libyan Oil Minister <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshuki </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil chief, <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, who is also president of the cartel, said the price of oil `` could do a little bit more.'' `` We would like it to be 18,'' he told reporters after his mid-day arrival in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In June, the cartel set its target price at $ 18 a 42-gallon barrel for the June-December period. A benchmark of seven crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> recently averaged $ 17.04 a barrel. It was more than $ 18 last spring. West Texas Intermediate, the key American brand, has been trading in the range of $ 19.50 to $ 20 a barrel.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Saturday called for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to return several islands claimed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but occupied by the Soviets since the end of World War II. He also warned <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading opposition party, the Socialists, that their desire to modify a mutual security treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is wrong. The Socialists, helped by scandals and a controversial tax reform that have eroded support for the long-governing conservatives, currently are riding a wave of popularity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Anybody that thinks you ought to tamper or rewrite or modify the security treaty is wrong,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him on Air Force II. `` It is not just a mere piece of paper. It is an alliance, security, deterrence.'' More than 50,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troopers are stationed throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under the treaty the Socialists want modified. The Socialists also have urged strict checks to ensure <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels calling on Japanese ports do not have nuclear weapons on board _ a call in conflict with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy of refusing to say whether or not its ships carry nuclear arms. During a visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> shares <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` heartfelt desire'' for a return of several small islands off Hokkaido's northern shores, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> calls its `` northern territories.'' `` We hope the idea of glasnost and perestroika will someday come to the northern territories and that they will be rightfully returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a speech at the official residence of Hokkaido's Gov. <PERSON> Takahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokomichi </PERSON>. Soviet troops occupied the islands in the closing days of World War II in 1945, and Japanese civilians were evacuated. The territorial dispute has stalled completion of a treaty formally ending the war and a visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms are based on his policies of glasnost, or openness, and perestroika, the restructing of the government and economy. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> traveled to the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Chitose </LOCATION>, where he was briefed on Soviet military strength in the area. Col. <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoso </PERSON>, flight group commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> the Soviets have stationed one army division, or about 10,000 troops, in the disputed islands. He said they also have 400,000 troops in the region, along with 800 ships and 2,400 aircraft. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> later visited the American <ORGANIZATION> Misawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, on the northern tip of <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main island, where he spoke to about 1,000 military personnel and their families before returning to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in the evening. He was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, and his wife. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on the second leg of an <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> tour that will take him to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Bars City from Enforcing Pit Bull Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge barred the city from enforcing its strict regulations of pit bull dogs, including a ban on all new pit bulls after Oct. 1. In a ruling released Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGrasse </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> regulations irrational and vague, saying the agency had not shown pit bull terriers were more dangerous than other breeds. `` Vicious dog laws are already in place and can be enforced,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> called <PERSON> DeGrasse </PERSON>'s ruling `` a resounding victory for dog owners and citizens concerned with sane dog safety laws.'' She had opposed the regulations and submitted her own legislation. The board, which enacted rules at Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s request, called the pit bull `` a unique public health problem'' and cited the dog's `` unusual savagery.'' The American <ORGANIZATION> Kennel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> sued to challenge the rules, which required the dogs to be neutered, tatooed with a registration number and leashed and muzzled or confined at all times. The city argued that while pit bulls were 2 percent of the city's dog population, they inflicted 14 percent of the bites over a 10-month period beginning November 1987 The name pit bull is used for several breeds, including the <LOCATION> Staffordshire </LOCATION> bull terrier, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Staffordshire </LOCATION> terrier, the American pit bull terrier and sometimes the bull terrier. Bred over the centuries for dog fighting, they have powerful chest, neck and jaw muscles.

 Smoke and ash billowed from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Etna </LOCATION> on Saturday but officials said there was no immediate danger from the volcano to any nearby towns. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most active volcano spilled lava from its southeast crater Friday night, but that the flow came to a halt in a desert-like valley on Etna's slopes 8,700 feet above sea level. The mountain continued to rumble Saturday morning and coughed up glowing material. Seismographs at the international vulcanology institute in <LOCATION> Catania </LOCATION> reported tremors caused by magma movements within the mountain. Although the volcano currently poses no danger to surrounding areas, flights to and from <LOCATION> Catania </LOCATION> have been rerouted around Etna because of recent volcano activity, and tourists have been forbidden to enter those slopes deemed to be at risk. Meanwhile, natives and tourists alike enjoyed the fireworks offered by one of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s major tourist attractions.

<HEAD>Parents Shocked By Molesting Background</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents are outraged after learning that the owner of their children's private school, arrested for possessing child pornography, was once convicted of child molesting. `` It just sickens you to think that your child is in that type of environment,'' added the mother of a 5-year-old girl who attended the Fast Track fo Learning school in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Parents were surprised the state does so little to monitor private schools. `` If all this has happened before, why is that school there?'' asked a woman whose 6-year-old has attended <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>'s school for the past two years. `` Why should we have to check this out? Why was it allowed to open?'' Parents, speaking on condition of anonymity, talked about the school and its owner-teacher in stories published Saturday by The <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> News-Journal and The Orlando Sentinel. The school's 18 students ranged from kindergarten to the fifth grade. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> were arrested Thursday after authorities searched their <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> home and found `` numerous photographic items of child pornography,'' according to court documents. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, 51, and his 56-year-old wife were each charged with 84 counts of possessing child pornography. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> was being held in lieu of $ 420,000 bail. Mrs. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>'s bail was set at $ 252,000. State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> is asking parents of Fast Track students to contact his office to determine if any of their children are pictured in the approximately 100 photographs. The <PERSON> Bowens </PERSON> previously operated a day-care center in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>, but in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> refused to renew the center's license because <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> worked there. The state claimed the couple lied on the license application by not including his conviction. Anyone convicted of a felony can not work in a day-care center, according to a 1984 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law. They opened the Fast Track school in 1986. In 1966, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to fondling a minor at a public school in <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pointe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. He paid a $ 250 fine and served five years of probation. Police obtained a search warrant for the <PERSON> Bowens </PERSON>' home after a woman reported seeing child pornography there when she went to pick up her 7-year-old son after class. Because Fast Track was a private school, and not a public day-care center, it was basically exempt from strenuous state supervision, said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, district counsel for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem with schools is just that they have to register with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which does no investigation,'' he said. `` There's just no regulation of private schools at all.'' The only requirement of non-public schools in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is that they comply with compulsory-attendance laws, retain student records and meet building codes, officials said. In court documents, prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility of `` assaults upon children'' by <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. But they declined to elaborate on the evidence, including whether current students have been identified in the photos or if any molestation has been alleged. Parents said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> was the school's primary teacher, although Mrs. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> occasionally helped out. Mrs. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> also has been working at the <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, planning exhibits and running puppet shows for children.

 <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> gingerly moved to recover from the fury of Hurricane Hugo on Saturday, with residents taking stock of destroyed homes, boats and businesses and damage estimates topping $ 3 billion. The storm wore itself out over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> after progressively weakening through <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, which left at least 27 people dead in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, was blamed for an additional 21 deaths in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the hardest-hit city on the mainland, many residents remained without electricity or telephone service Saturday. Long lines formed at the few service stations that had generators to pump gas. National Guard troops remained on the streets to protect homes and businesses from looting. They will remain, Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said, `` just as long as we need to to maintain the safety for people.'' Running water was restored to most places, although residents were warned to boil it before drinking it, and mail service could resume Monday, Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said at a news conference. Banks of pay telephones were to be set up in city parks. <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas hoped to have power restored to hospitals, which had been operating on generators, by late Saturday, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. But utility officials had no idea when residential power would be restored. As many as a half-million people were without power statewide, and ice for coolers was scarce to non-existent in the state capital of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` If you're a camper, you're going to be in good shape,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, in a wry observation about the primitive conditions. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said damage in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> alone might reach $ 1 billion, but accurate assessments of the damage from the region's most devastating storm in 30 years would take days, at the least. Two billion dollars is a conservative estimate of damage to buildings and other structures associated with the tourism industry, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, state tourism director. `` Our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a little rugged'' for a while, he said. `` I have never in my life seen anything like it,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said after flying over the state for a second day Saturday. `` It's beyond your worst nightmare. It's devastating.'' He estimated that 65 percent of the buildings were destroyed along the coastline from <LOCATION> Folly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> returned to their home in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, to find half of it gone. A neighbor had a swimming pool filled with mud, Mrs. <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> said. `` There's no water, there's no fences left, and there's marsh grass everywhere. There's nothing called landscaping anymore. And there's six feet of water in our basement,'' she said. `` The marsh animals are dead everywhere,'' she added. `` In fact, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> says one's hanging up on our garage door opener.'' At least 14 people died in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, authorities said. Four more died in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state when the storm churned north. In the storm's aftermath, three waterspouts _ tornadoes spawned over water _ moved ashore along the <ORGANIZATION> Outer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, damaging several homes and cars. No one was injured. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, which first struck land at the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Guadaloupe </LOCATION> on Monday, traveled 2,500 miles before slamming into <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> late Thursday with winds of 135 mph. As it made its way inland, it was downgraded to a tropical storm and lost that designation when its winds dropped below 40 mph around <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> late Friday. By Saturday morning, the remnants of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> had been absorbed by a stronger weather front in eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We really ca n't find it anymore,'' he said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said the Hugo relief effort in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and on the mainland will cost the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> $ 38 million, the largest storm-relief operation ever mounted by the agency. `` We estimate that more than 73,000 people have received assistance to date, and this is just the beginning'' <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> said.

 Flight data recovered from the wreckage of a French airliner confirmed Saturday that explosives caused the crash that killed 171 people over an African desert, the government said. Information obtained from the plane's black boxes `` showed that the flight proceded in a normal manner until a total interruption, which translates as an explosion in flight'' at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` The work of the crew was proceeding normally when the recording of words and electronic data abruptly stopped,'' the statement said. It said data from the black boxes backed up the preliminary findings of an investigative commission at the site that `` leads us to accept the hypothesis of the presence of explosives on board.'' Workers searching wreckage in the northern African nation of <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> recovered both the cockpit recorder, which records in-flight conversations by the crew, and the flight data recorder, which records information such as altitude and speed. Both devices arrived in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> late Friday night. The conclusion drawn from the data signals the start of an intensive search for the individual or group responsible for the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 772, which was flying to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, when it crashed Tuesday. The victims included seven Americans, among them <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, wife of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a previously unknown group calling itself the Secret Chadian Resistance claimed responsibility on Saturday for the bombing. In a typed a statement sent to Western news agencies, the group said: `` The struggle will continue until the complete withdrawal of all military colonial forces from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> maintains 1,200 soldiers in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> to help the former French colony in its 16-year-old war with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> signed an agreement Aug. 31 putting an end to the conflict. Responsiblity for the <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> bombing earlier had been claimed by the Iran-backed Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad is among several radcal fundamentalist groups believed to be part of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the Iranian-supported umbrella group thought to hold 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Callers claiming to represent Islamic Jihad demanded the release of Shiite Moslem religious leader <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who was kidnapped from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28 by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has not been linked to the kidnapping. However, <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> weekly, recently quoted Islamic militants loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as charging <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with reneging on a 1988 deal that resulted in the release of three French hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The newspaper said the militants were planning attacks on French interests in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> continues to deny making any deal for the hostages, beyond agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, recurring reports in the French press detail a deal in which <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> secured release of the hostages by agreeing to free <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, a pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorist serving a life sentence for attempting to kill former Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Shahpour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1980. Before the latest claim, an unidentified source at the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> was quoted by the French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> as saying that the manhunt for the plane bombers would be focused on the `` Shiite network'' in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Police, meanwhile, were examining the plane's passenger list for suspects, concentrating on nine people who got off in the Chadian capital, <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, the plane's last stop before exploding over the <LOCATION> Tenere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>. Investigators also are loking for clues about the precise nature of the explosive, where it was located on the aircraft and how it got on board. Autopies on the bodies of the victims were expected to reveal traces of material or toxic substances that would help answer these questions. A brief statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> late Friday night confirmed that an investigating commission of officials from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> had found indications of explosives aboard the flight, but it provided no details until the announcement on Saturday. The French army, in charge of recovering the victims, flew 200 body bags to the site Saturday where paratroopers and military doctors have been working in 120-degree heat. The violence of the explosion and the rapid decomposition of the bodies are expected to make identification of some victims difficult. About 100 bodies, already gathered for transport, were to be flown Saturday by helicopter to <LOCATION> Agadez </LOCATION>, a village in central <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, and then on to <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION>, the capital, said Col. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Job </PERSON>, who is supervising the operation. The rest of the passengers remain scattered across miles of sand. Among the dead retrieved from the wreckage is the pilot, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Raveneau </PERSON>, and four other crew members found in the cockpit of the plane and identified by their uniforms, <PERSON> Job </PERSON> said. Workers at the site said watches on the victims indicate that the explosion occurred at 2:08 p.m. Tuesday.

 Boats at Wild Dunes Marina were stacked `` like toys,'' three fishing piers at <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> were severely damaged, and the shoreline at <LOCATION> Surfside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> moved two blocks inland. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s tourism industry suffered at least $ 2 billion in damage to buildings and other structures in Hurricane Hugo, state Tourism Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said Saturday. `` Our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a little rugged'' for a while, <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said. `` But we have positive attitudes. We've been saying ` When I breathe, I hope.' That's one of our state mottoes.'' <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said the storm appeared to hit at random, one house or business destroyed while the one next door was left intact. Some tourism businesses already have reopened. In 1988, tourists spent $ 4.7 billion in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, with the impact of that spending estimated to be close to $ 7.5 billion, he said. Before Hugo, <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said, the state predicted a 6 percent to 8 percent growth in tourist spending this year. Now, he said, that should reach only 4 percent. Details about damage were somewhat sketchy since people have not yet been allowed to return to much of the coast and electricity and telephone lines were down. Here is a list of how individual areas fared along <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 220 miles of coast: _ <LOCATION> CHARLESTON </LOCATION>: Most of the historic buildings downtown suffered some wind and water damage, but the main structures remained intact `` That's a blessing because that's what makes <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said. _ NORTH <LOCATION> MYRTLE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> BEACH </LOCATION>: From Cherry Grove south to <LOCATION> Windy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, beachfront motels were heavily damaged; some were destroyed Several high-rise hotels had erosion under their foundations, but none appeared likely to collapse. An 8 p.m. - 7 a.m. curfew was in effect to prevent looting. <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> was covered with sand and in some places under several feet of water. Most of the dozens of structures destroyed were valued at more than $ 100,000, said state Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. _ <LOCATION> ATLANTIC </LOCATION> <LOCATION> BEACH </LOCATION>: A Holiday Inn had palm trees in its oceanfront rooms Furniture was pushed up against the back walls, with carpet peeled up. Most swimming pools had severe cracks. Some were filled with sand. _ <LOCATION> MYRTLE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> BEACH </LOCATION>: Three fishing piers were severely damaged or destroyed The high-rise hotels along the Grand Strand remained intact, with damage to swimming pools, first-floor lobbies and restaurants. Parking lots were covered with sand and water. _ <LOCATION> SURFSIDE </LOCATION> BEACH: Downed trees and power lines; refrigerators, air conditioners, toilets, chairs and tables littered streets Mud on <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> was 10 inches deep in some places. The shoreline moved inland two blocks. The town's best-known landmark, the Surfside Fishing Pier, was gone. _ GARDEN CITY: Erosion beneath houses and condominiums left them perched precariously on cliffs of sand Roads were covered with sand as far as three blocks inland. The city pier was destroyed. _ <LOCATION> PAWLEYS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ISLAND </LOCATION>: At least 14 homes were destroyed, and numerous others were damaged At least three homes wound up across or in the creek that separates the island from the mainland. A channel of water about 20 feet wide sliced the island in two. _ GEORGETOWN: The marina suffered extensive damage A sailboat that was securely tied down pulled apart a dock. Condominums on the bayside were demolished. _ ISLE OF PALMS and <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>'S ISLAND: Every building on both islands appeared to have been damaged Many houses were buckled and had their supports ripped away. Several houses were in roads. The Wild Dunes resort, known for its golf course and tennis courts, on the north end of <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palms </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, suffered heavy damage. The larger of the high-rise buildings in the resort apparently remained intact, but <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> estimated only 10 percent of the houses remained. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said boats at the Wild Dunes marina were stacked atop one another `` like toys.'' _ FOLLY BEACH: As many as 30 percent of the homes had either disappeared or were uninhabitable, and it appeared all the others suffered some damage _ <LOCATION> EDISTO </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ISLAND </LOCATION>: Suffered serious erosion with water rushing over the road along the waterfront and under most oceanfront homes, many of which were on poles South of <LOCATION> Edisto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the damage was mostly roof and water damage, with some windows broken and trees and power lines downed. An official with emergency preparedness in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> compared it to the damage done by a severe thunderstorm. The southern portion of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s coast includes the resort areas of Hunting Island, <LOCATION> Fripp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 Many victims of Hurricane Hugo are relying on flashlights, candles and antique kerosene lamps during the dark, eerie nights in a city deprived of electricity, running water and other basic services. Thirty mobile feeding vans were to arrive Saturday to provide food for hurricane victims, said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, executive director of the Carolina-Low Countries chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to feed everybody that needs feeding and is hungry,'' he said. `` Some people do n't have any electricity. Some people do n't have a house to cook in.'' Since Hugo hit Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has been passing out sandwiches and drinks at its damaged headquarters in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. On Saturday afternoon, 1,500 people remained in 14 shelters, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers with chain saws were helping homeowners remove trees and other debris. Almost 200 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> staff members have been dispatched to the <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast to work with hundreds of volunteers, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> expects to provide 5,000 cots and blankets and 9,000 cleanup kits for homes, as well as cash grants so families can buy emergency supplies. Except for power provided by emergency generators at hospitals and other high-priority facilities, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> remained without electricity. Phone service was greatly reduced. Callers sometimes could not call around the block but could reach relatives across the continent. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Saturday morning that running water has been restored, but he advised residents to boil drinking water. Thousands of residents were unable to take showers, wash dishes or flush toilets for about 36 hours. `` I had a shower this morning. Do n't I look beautiful?'' said Loving <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` I feel wonderful.'' Her friend <PERSON> Myriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Buvinger </PERSON> said she was cooking on a gas stove, but had to use candles at night and, until water was restored, scooped dirty water from sinks to flush toilets. Like many residents who have electric stoves, Mrs. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has not been able to cook since the storm. `` I had cereal and my very last banana for breakfast,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> noted Saturday morning. `` I do n't have any other breakfast plans. I had tuna fish salad with wilted lettuce last night.'' <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Narth </PERSON> said the storm left her with useless credit cards and no cash. Without electricity, businesses could not run the usual credit checks. `` We have no water, no electricity and no phone,'' she said as she walked along Meeting Street with her son and daughter, trying to find a restaurant. The owner of the only open restaurant in the neighborhood refused to take a credit card. At <ORGANIZATION> Aaron </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deli </ORGANIZATION>, customers lined up for a $ 3 breakfast of hot coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon and hashed brown potatoes cooked on a gas grill. `` We're the only place in town that's got it at that price,'' said co-owner <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>. `` We're trying to help ourselves by getting rid of perishable items and help the people because they do n't have anything to eat.'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> said he would offer shrimp and other seafood for lunch and dinner to lessen the risk that $ 12,000 worth of seafood in refrigerators and freezers will spoil. Long lines formed at two gas stations that re-opened Saturday morning using generators for power. C.B. <PERSON> Branan </PERSON>, surveying the uprooted trees and damaged historic homes in his downtown neighborhood, said he and his 17-year-old son were using kerosene lamps and a propane lantern for light. He is a hunter, he said, and is used to roughing it. `` We're not doing a lot of cooking,'' he added. `` We have hard-boiled eggs. I guess everybody is so hyped up we do n't feel like eating very much. The adrenalin is still in us.''

 This 319-year-old city suffered some damage from Hurricane Hugo to its wealth of historic buildings and sites, but history was on its side. The most famous monument, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, suffered about $ 1 million in damage to tourist areas but was mostly intact, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will send representatives to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to assess the damage to historic buildings, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON>, an official with the group, said Saturday. The organization was worried that <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> had dealt a major blow to the nation's architectural history, but early reports indicated a remarkable lack of damage, she said. No other city has as many historic landmarks, Ms. <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s historic district is home to about 2,000 buildings, including 73 built before the Revolutionary War. Among them are the <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> plantation, set on a bluff over the <LOCATION> Ashley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, which was built in the 1730s. The plantation house, a two-story red brick building with white columns, suffered some water and wind damage but apparently is structurally sound, Ms. <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> said. The city's elegant Battery district, an area of palatial 2-century-old homes that look through massive oaks draped with Spanish moss to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> beyond, are still occupied by families. A walking tour Saturday found many missing shingles and shutters _ and countless shredded oak trees _ but the Colonial and Georgian mansions stood unbroken. Broken oak trees damaged some formal gardens and blocked some streets. `` We have seen lots of roof damage, lots of fallen trees and lots of garden walls knocked down,'' said <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a great deal of mud and water on the first floors of some of the houses on the Battery, but fortunately there appears to be little structural damage.'' `` This house has been here for 269 years,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrady </PERSON>, who along with his neighbors was cleaning up <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s mess Saturday. `` We just lost a few slates off the roof.'' <PERSON> McCrady </PERSON>'s house was built in 1730 by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bull </PERSON>, who later became the lieutenant governor of the colony of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for the British. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said most of the oldest city structures had already withstood a furious hurricane in the late 1750s as well as the famous 1886 earthquake that destroyed dozens of lesser buildings. `` The oldest buildings we have were designed to withstand storms, and the ones that are left have been through this before,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` But I'd say there has n't been a storm of this magnitude for 200 years.'' Two-foot-thick walls, raised foundations and sturdy storm shutters all are staples of the old structures, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said _ safeguards not found in newer buildings that in some cases crumbled like matchsticks under <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s force.

 A rocket struck one of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s crowded bazaars Saturday, killing at least 11 people, hospital officials reported. There have been scores of rocket attacks against the capital this summer and the Marxist government blames them on U.S.-backed guerrillas. Saturday at midafternoon when the area was bustling with shoppers a rocket hit an ice cream vendor's shop in stalls jammed together on the south bank of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The explosion left shreds of cloth dangling from the shattered windows of stores around the muddy site. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Ebnisina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the rocket killed 11 people and wounded 19. However, government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> put the number at 20 people killed and 45 injured. He said three rockets fell in and around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday. A rocket attack in the same area of bazaars Friday killed 17 people and injured 38, the hospital offficials said. More than 300 people have been killed and 700 wounded since June in the rocket attacks on the capital. The guerrillas say they only fire at military targets and claim the Soviet-supplied government aims rockets at its own civilians.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday signed a bill designed to free a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mother jailed 25 months ago in a bitter child custody dispute and attorneys filed an emergency motion for her.????? yokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill to free Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> `` out of compassion for her plight.'' The bill was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amid growing national attention for the case. It applies retroactively to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who was jailed for failing to produce her 7-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, for court-ordered visits with the girl's father, Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a prominent plastic surgeon, hid her daughter and went to jail after alleging that <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> had sexually abused the girl. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has repeatedly denied those charges and at one point offered a $ 5,000 reward for information that would help find the girl. The child's whereabouts, however, remain secret. Hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, filed the papers with the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> seeking her release. Court Clerk <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> then began telephoning each of the nine judges on the panel in hopes that one could come to the courthouse and review the request. Despite the new law, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> can not be freed without a judge's order. `` I'm doing my best to transmit it to the judges, and that's all I can do,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said he was `` hopeful the court will act promptly, but we have no guarantees,'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said. The bill takes advantage of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' authority to review district laws and among other things sets a 12-month cap for civil contempt child-custody jailings. It also contains a so-called sunset provision that means it automatically goes off the books in 18 months. As clamor over the case grew, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accelerated action on the bill. A late-working <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure on Friday morning, shortly after midnight, and sent it to the president's desk. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the House sponsor, and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who pushed the measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, both have said they were motivated by concern for <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s dilemma <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON>, have complained that the bill does not require <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> to produce <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been badly served by his advisors,'' <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Saturday. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> obviously loves children, but this bill does nothing to insure that <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> will ever see her father again.'' As the bill raced through the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to the president, the entire appeals court was reviewing an August decision by a three-judge appeals panel that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> should go free. In that earlier decision, the judges had ruled that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> should be released because the coercive basis for her jailing had become unconstitutionally punitive.

 Government efforts to restore peace suffered another setback with 14 people killed in ethnic strife, military officials said Saturday. The officials said the latest victims, all Sinhalese, were killed Friday. They gave no details. Independent sources said at least 35 people were killed in ethnic violence in the previous 24 hours. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as did the military officials, said 24 people were killed in south and central areas of this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nation, and 11 bodies were found in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Most of the recent killings have been blamed on Sinhalese militants waging a campaign against the Sinhalese-controlled government. Justice Minister <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Perara </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that 865 people were killed in ethnic violence between Aug. 15 to Sept. 15. Military officials said since Sept. 15 at least 350 more people have been slain, raising the known death toll to 1,215 since Aug. 15. In its latest peace initiative, the government announced Saturday it will include members of an extremist Sinhalese group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, in a multiparty committee to monitor peace efforts in Tamil-dominated northern and eastern zones of the country. Indian peacekeeping forces have been patrolling that region, but about 600 of <LOCATION> Insidan </LOCATION> soldiers left for home Friday. It was the first Indian withdrawal since <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> signed an agreement Monday stipulating that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will pull out all of its troops by Dec. 31. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> deployed an estimated 47,000 soldiers in July 1987 to supervise a Sri Lankan-Indian peace accord that offered Tamil rebels limited autonomy if they laid down their arms. But the largest Tamil group rejected the accord and began fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in a push for an independent Tamil homeland. The presence of Indian troops ignited a backlash by the Sinhalese militants. They claimed the government had offered too many concessions to the minority Tamils and compromised the nation's sovereignty by accepting <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> soldiers to the country. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form about 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s population of 16 million and claim discrimination by the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority. The Tamil revolt and attacks by Sinhalese militants have claimed at least 16,000 lives since the Tamil insurgency broke out in 1983.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, disclosing plans for a 1990 summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said Saturday he hoped the talks would produce an agreement on arms control.

They also worked on an agreement for inspection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet underground nuclear weapons test. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a break from golfing through a rain storm with his national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, to receive a phone call from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on the 10th hole at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> golf course. He summoned reporters to tell them the news. The president said he hoped the summit would produce agreements on arms control and added that `` there'll be plenty of other things to discuss in addition to arms control.'' Asked what he hoped to achieve in the meeting, the president said he would be talking about achieving further arms reductions. `` There's a chance for agreement of that nature.'' As for accomplishments during the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` A wide array of subjects, we will be continuing to work on the arms control agenda, it's not my view that summits must have arms control agreements, but we're going to be working toward it.'' The president, in a written statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, said: `` I envision a broad discussion of the full agenda that the two sides have established _ human rights, bilateral relations, arms control, regional issues and transnational issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be held late spring or early summer most likely in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which he described as `` proper for this one.'' He added: `` Undoubtedly it will be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Asked about the timing of the summit next year, he said, `` It could be sooner but this is the agreed timetable.'' He said it would give time for the bureaucracy to `` move forward on a lot of fronts'' and work on a more results-oriented summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was a commitment by the Soviets to hold the summit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that he had discussed that with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> when they met in the Oval Office last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that at the summit he would be `` going forward in every way to achieve further arms reductions.'' On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, who has been the target of death threats from drug lords, meant the drug lords were not fazed by the crackdown against them, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think so.'' `` I see no reason that a single resignation will signal or lead to or lessen'' the resolve by Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to rid his country of drug traffickers, he replied. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to addressed the annual luncheon of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He was greeted by loud, sustained cheers, whistles and applause. He shook hands and shared the head table with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democrat he defeated to win the presidency.

<HEAD>Freedom of the Press and Religion Among Proposed Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Freedom of the press and religion are on the agenda of the Soviet legislature's second session starting Monday and debate is expected to be sharp even though many proposed reforms have little chance of approval. The 4-month-old legislative session during the spring and summer reacted to Kremlin proposals, but this time a group of 345 reform deputies spent Saturday discussing an alternative platform. One concept they considered was the freedom for anyone to start a newspaper. The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which includes such figures as human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, also proposes the open sale of paper, printing presses and copy machines. Under the continuing system of censorship, distribution of these items is strictly limited. <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, an economist, said the group plans to vote on its platform Sunday. The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, has a formidable agenda. It plans to act on 80 bills in 45 working days. Items include human rights, ethnic strife and salvaging the economy. `` All are very important,'' deputy <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alekseyev </PERSON> told a government-sponsored news conference Friday. `` All should be adopted.'' But the Supreme Soviet, once a rubber-stamp body that met a few days a year to approve the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s actions, has changed under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of restructuring and glasnost, or openess. <PERSON> Alekseyev </PERSON> said there are no fewer than four versions of a new law on the press and glasnost. One calls for a complete ban on censorship, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The draft platform of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> calls for the elimination of internal passports, freedom to move in and out of the country, access for defense lawyers to investigative reports, public financing of parliamentary factions, the creation of non-government television and unemployment insurance. But even the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> does not suggest ending the ban on private ownership of land _ a vital concept of Soviet communism. Legislators also will consider bills on the right to strike, on raising pensions, private cooperatives and taxation, said <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON>, a legislative leader and one-time <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> residents on Saturday hauled water from swimming pools, rivers and parts of the island unaffected by Hurricane Hugo as crews worked around the clock to restore water and electricity. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen arrived in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> for a two-day fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Officials say <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> caused at least 27 deaths and billions of dollars in damage in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and other islands of the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> before hitting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast on Thursday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has declared both <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> disaster areas. In addition, 1,200 military police and other troops were dispatched to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to halt widespread looting. Officials in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> complained that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was more interested in deploying troops than airlifting relief supplies to the stricken <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. At a news conference here Saturday, Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who headed the congressional fact-finding team, was asked why federal assistance did not start arriving in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> until four or five days after the storm `` That is one of the reasons we are here,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the islands had already received relief aid including 100,000 Army field rations, 15,000 cots, four electrical generators with operating crews and medical personnel from the 109th Evacuation Hospital of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. It said more nonperishable food and plastic sheeting for home repairs would also be sent. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> had arrived at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> and was producing 58,600 gallons of water per day. It said truck-mounted water purification units were being set up in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to provide about 270,000 gallons of fresh water daily. Virgin Islands Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said the territory was receiving large amounts of aid, but distribution of the supplies was disorganized. He said he expected the mainland military troops to remain another week or so. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> was returning to normal, despite millions of dollars in damage, particularly in the eastern part of the island. In the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, roads were cleared and supermarkets and some restaurants were open. But two-thirds of the city of 1.1 million people still had no running water Saturday, and one-quarter had no electricity, utility officials said. They said 70 percent of the island was without running water and up to 35 percent without electricity. Utility officials said water service could be restored to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> by Saturday night if work was completed as planned on installing four electric motors to run pumps at a dam servicing the metropolitan area. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> C-130 flew into the capital Saturday night with 20,000 gallons of water for distribution. With a steady downpour Saturday, radio station <ORGANIZATION> WOSO </ORGANIZATION> suggested that listeners catch rainwater. The government was distributing water in National Guard tanker trucks. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> advised residents to boil any drinking water collected from other sources. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left homeless more than 45,000 people _ about 90 percent of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>'s population. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, is one of the three main islands of the group, which also includes St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. He said damage was tentatively estimated at $ 4 billion. However, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> coordinator in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, said Saturday his office had made a preliminary estimate of $ 400 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> obtained authority Friday from <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> to order <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals to enforce all laws on the islands and to prosecute any looters, officials said. There were no reports of looting Friday, but virtually every store in <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, appeared to have been cleaned out in earlier looting. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that some of its members took part in the looting, and several witnesses said some police also were involved.

 Terrified by a new wave of political violence, the family of an abducted human rights activist fled this country Saturday after spending nearly six weeks holed up in a room at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumalda </PERSON> <PERSON> Camey </PERSON>'s husband, her two babies, her brother and his family left for <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> under Spanish diplomatic protection. They were following six other relatives who were granted political asylum by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> last week. `` It is incredible how this family has been persecuted,'' Angel <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, the deputy federal attorney general for human rights, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Their flight began Aug. 15, when armed men burst into the activist's modest home in <LOCATION> Esquintla </LOCATION> province at 5 a.m. and dragged her off. `` I heard the shots and the screams. It was her. Kidnapped,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camey </PERSON>, who was interviewed last week in the crowded room where he and his family had taken refuge. His 23-year-old wife was the fourth person in her family to disappear in 10 months. The others eventually turned up _ all shot dead and dumped on roadsides. Camey, a 23-year-old farmer, does n't believe his wife survived either Under the rightist generals who ruled in the early 1980s, tens of thousands of Guatemalans died or disappeared, including <PERSON> Camey </PERSON>'s father His wife has been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an organization made up of relatives of the missing. Human rights groups put the toll of dead and disappeared as a result of activities of right-wing death squads at 40,000. They say many of the squads were linked to the army or other security forces. Tens of thousands of others have been displaced, fleeing the military's scorched earth campaign against leftist guerrillas in the countryside. After his wife was abducted, <PERSON> Camey </PERSON>'s family and his brother-in-law's family, fearing for their own safety, sought refuge at Mutual Support's office in the capital of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 30 miles away. About thirty minutes after they arrived, a grenade was lobbed through the window. They were evacuated to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, where they remained for nearly six weeks. With the advent of civilian rule three years ago, human rights abuses began to abate. But in the last two months, there has been a surge of killings and bombings. Bodies have been found along the roads, their hands cut off. Fear has returned. `` <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> is returning to the bloody times,'' <PERSON> Camey </PERSON> said, cradling his children. `` There is terrible violence, not just in my home, but in many homes.'' Human rights workers blame the latest violence on right-wing extremists who believe that President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>'s rule is too liberal. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, who has survived two coup attempts, has denied any security forces are involved in the current violence.

 Officials declared a forest disaster in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Saturday after <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left half the state's 43 counties with extensive or moderate timber damage. `` It certainly is one of the worst forest disasters that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has seen in many, many years,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a forester with the state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The storm, which came ashore near <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> packing sustained winds of 135 mph, tore a path across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s coast early Friday. Although its strength was dissipated once it hit land, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> uprooted trees and broke limbs as it quickly moved north into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Extensive timber damage, defined as an area that will require a great deal of salvage, occurred in nine counties on or near the coast. Moderate timber damage _ requiring some salvage _ occurred in 12 counties, and all the rest of the state's counties suffered light timber damage, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Forestry is the third-largest manufacturing industry in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, generating $ 4.3 billion annually and employing more than 30,000. Seventy-five state personnel were surveying damage in the hardest-hit areas Saturday, and 35 tractors were brought in to help salvage efforts, he said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he could not yet estimate the cost of the damage, and it was still too early to develop a replanting plan or ask for relief aid, he said. `` We will be working with all the private landowners in trying to salvage the material,'' he added. `` It's going to be a big job.''

<TEXT>
 Finance officials of the world's seven largest economic powers Saturday expressed dismay at the persistent increase in the value of the dollar this year and pledged to take coordinated action if necessary to drive the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower. In their first meeting since April, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ stepped up their rhetoric aimed at curbing the buoyant dollar, a development threatening to derail improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The group had expressed a similar concern last spring, but the tone of the statement released Saturday was considerably stronger, holding out the threat that if the dollar rises any further the economic powers would intervene together in world currency markets. `` The ministers and governors considered the rise in recent months of the dollar inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals,'' the group said in a two-page communique released after the eight-hour meeting. `` They agreed that a rise of the dollar above current levels ... could adversely affect prospects for the world economy ... -LRB- and -RRB- agreed to cooperate closely in exchange markets,'' the statement said. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> emphasized this part of the communique in a briefing for reporters but he refused to say what specific actions the countries would be willing to take if the dollar goes higher. In April, the officials used milder language and simply said they agreed that `` a rise of the dollar which undermined adjustment efforts ... would be counterproductive,'' not any rise. The group, meeting two hours longer than expected at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, also addressed topics ranging from the Third World's crushing $ 1.3 trillion debt to Western efforts to aid economic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Officials told reporters the extra time was devoted to discussing events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which the communique termed `` historic.'' `` The whole meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> became electric when we started talking about the events going on in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, adding that the finance ministers hoped the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> would be able to reach quick agreement on a loan package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Third World debt, the communique praised <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s latest initiative for achieving `` substantial progress.'' Since the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan was announced in March, commercial banks have struck tentative agreements granting relief to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Last week, however, three major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks added more than $ 4 billion to their loss reserves for developing country loans. Analysts are expressing concern that this could signal unwillingness to make enough new money available to sustain growth in the developing nations, most of them in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The communique noted the development, saying `` diversified financial support from the banks is needed to support sound economic reform programs through a broad array of new lending and debt @ debt service reduction mechanisms.'' But, it was the group's remarks on the dollar that were most eagerly awaited by financial markets. `` That's a much stronger statement against any rise in the dollar,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer. `` I would expect on the heels of that statement more aggressive dollar selling from central banks.'' He said the G-7 countries likely now will be willing to accelerate the decline of the dollar when it is falling on its own, not just counter any rise. And, he speculated that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would show more willingness in the months ahead to raise their interest rates as a means of influencing exchange markets. Possibly, he said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may nudge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates lower. An increase in Japanese and West German interest rates would make investing in those countries more attractive and would thus raise the value of their currencies. A cut in interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would push the dollar lower. The G-7 has issued statements in the past pledging to hold the dollar down. But despite heavy intervention in currency markets, efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The volume of private currency trading has grown so huge that it dwarfs any buying or selling that central banks can do. Since the last G-7 meeting, the dollar has appreciated by about 10 percent against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the West German mark. The dollar on Friday bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks, well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading range sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks. A strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaper for American consumers. The trade gap shrank by 22 percent last year, but progress has slowed in 1989, with the deficit shrinking at only about half of last year's rate. In addition to the narrow question of exchange rates, finance officials discussed the broader issue of economic coordination. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to stimulate consumer demand in their countries as a means of cutting their trade surpluses and reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in turn, is being urged to reignite efforts to curb its budget deficit, which is believed to contribute to the trade deficit. The Group of Seven talks were being held before the start of the annual meetings this week of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and its sister lending organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> session was preceded by a Group of Five meeting _ the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> excluding <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> met one-on-one with <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, the new Japanese minister of finance, and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>, the French finance minister. It was <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>.

 A slight temblor jolted downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Saturday about two hours after another minor quake shook an area east of the city, but no injuries or damages were reported. `` The ceiling shook a little bit and the desks shook a few seconds,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman Deputy <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosely </PERSON>. The afternoon earthquake measured 2.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said Hall Daily of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Its epicenter was about three miles north of downtown and six miles south-southwest of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, he said. About two hours earlier, a quake measuring 2.9 on the Richer scale shook an area about 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Daily said. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number on the scale means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will hold their first summit meeting next year, officials announced Saturday as the two superpowers completed a half-dozen accords and cleared a major roadblock to a treaty on slashing long-range nuclear weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who spent the weekend in talks with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said the summit would be held in `` spring or early summer.'' He announced a key concession from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to move ahead toward a long-range weapons agreement despite its objections to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars program. First official word of the summit plans came from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who informed reporters on a golf course near his vacation home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> after taking a telephone call from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` I think around the world people will be pleased,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed pleasure with the outcome of the weekend talks and said he would meet <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, possibly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Later, in a written statement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I envision a broad discussion of the full agenda that the two sides have established _ human rights, bilateral relations, arms control, regional issues and transnational issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke more than a thousand miles from the snow-capped <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> resort where <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> _ obviously pleased with their diplomacy _ reached agreement on a chemical weapons accord and several other points. The agreements include: _ Exchange of data on chemical weapons by the end of the year and visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plants by June 30. In a second phase, there would be more intensive on-site inspections of the submitted data. _ An `` umbrella agreement'' in principle that there should be verification of missile plants and information exchanged even before a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons is completed. _ Advance notification to the other side of exercises with long-range bombers and other strategic weapons. _ A ceiling of 10 on launchers carrying mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles at any one base. Some of the launchers would be exposed for monitoring. _ Cooperating to enhance the power of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to settle disputes. _ Two agreements to facilitate movement across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eskimos </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and Eskimos in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> for visits. _ Agreement on interpreting international rules for ship movements. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> later told reporters that the two sides `` took a series of steps across the full arms control agenda to overcome old misconceptions and build trust.'' In one of a pair of conciliatory gestures, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Soviets would dismantle their <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar facility. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has charged the Siberian radar was intended to be part of a space-based defense outlawed in a 1972 treaty. The Soviet foreign minister insisted, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` remove our concerns'' about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar stationed in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said later he would be surprised if the Soviets were demanding that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities be dismantled. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> wanted to send Soviet inspectors to the sites to make sure the radar is legal under the 1972 treaty. In fact, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, the installations are `` totally legal'' and any action on them required the approval of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Soviets also removed another key impediment to a strategic arms agreement, dropping their demand the pact include limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in back-to-back news conferences. During the talks, the Soviets said a deal to limit nuclear-tipped SLCMs can be reached in a separate, simultaneous agreement, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and his aides said. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains skeptical that means can be found to monitor nuclear SLCMs, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. And senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control aides predicted the Soviets might not insist on completing the SLCM agreement before signing the more sweeping strategic arms accord. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also told reporters that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was making a major concession in arms control negotiations, announcing that his government would not let its objections to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars program block completion of a treaty to cut long range nuclear submarines, missiles and bombers by 30 to 50 percent. `` The preparation and signing of a treaty now appears to be quite in reach,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> hailed the move but stressed `` there are some difficult issues that still remain.'' He cited keeping track of cruise missiles aboard airplanes, submarines and combat surface ships. `` We have moved from confrontation to dialogue and now to cooperation,'' he said of the evolving superpower relationship. The long-range weapons talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have been deadlocked over the Soviet demand that the treaty depend on completion of a separate agreement on space-based defense. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined to give ground on the search for a Star Wars defense in space against Soviet ballistic missiles, that made an arms reduction accord improbable. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledged the Soviet concession on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, stressed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to proceeding with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space-based defense program and said he had offered the Soviets the opportunity to visit research facilities associated with the program. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's willingness to lift a ban on mobile <ORGANIZATION> ICBM </ORGANIZATION>'s `` made it possible for us to move ahead on developing verification measures for mobile missiles.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` This agreement -LRB- for a summit -RRB- reflects the confidence of both sides that they will be able to reach important mutually acceptable agreements and generally to achieve substantial progress in relations between our two countries. And here I am referring above all to the sphere of disarmament and security.'' The two-stage chemical weapons agreement provides for an exchange of data by the end of the year and inspection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet stockpiles and plants beginning next June 30. More detailed inspections would be held later, if the 40 nations meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are within reach of an international treaty to ban the deadly weapons. Additional last-minute work remained to be done on another agreement for inspection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet underground nuclear weapons test. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he hoped it could be completed before the windup of his talks with his Soviet counterpart. After a fishing expedition on Sunday morning, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> head for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. Their work on the ground was also far-reaching. The chemical weapons accord will open <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals and plants to cross-inspection and the two sides will exchange data on the deadly weapon. Apart from the formal agreements, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> invited a group of Soviet experts to visit <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s test facility in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION> to learn more about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research on space defenses. An announcement said the Soviets also would visit a particle beam project at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> and observe a laser project at the TRW test plant. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> believes that such visits would be useful confidence-building measures and would reduce the risk of technological surprise,'' the announcement said. But, it added: `` Our invitation ... is not preconditioned on a reciprocal invitation by the Soviets.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to send 700 unarmed observers to patrol the borders of five Central American nations to deter guerrilla incursions, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said Saturday. A peacekeeping force of 100 observers had initially been scheduled to arrive in October, but <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said at a press conference that a larger force had been agreed upon. He said members will patrol border areas of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. He also said that the demobilization, repatriation and resettlement of Contra guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government `` is progressing.'' `` <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is about to enter into a stage of true democracy,'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said. He said, `` The Contras must accept demobilization because they have n't got the resources to do anything else.'' The U.S.-supported Contras have been based in the hills of eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since 1981. For most of that time, they operated with Honduran knowledge and consent, but <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling for disbanding the Contras by Dec. 8. Most of the Contras retreated to <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, along the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in March 1988 when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off weapons aid. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support at the latest count was still feeding 12,000 fighters and 42,000 relatives. While some Contras have deserted, others have marched back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with their weapons to await the outcome of Nicaraguan elections scheduled for February. Both the Sandinista government and the Contras have said they will refrain from `` offensive operations.'' The Aug. 7 agreement, also signed by <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, called for 100 observers from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to monitor the accords. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said the larger <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace force will be made up of military personnel and civilians based in all five countries. He said they will patrol border areas to discourage armed guerrilla incursions. He gave no date for their arrival. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> of harboring the Contras, while <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of supporting and arming Salvadoran leftist guerrillas. Teams from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, as well as other international observers, have been visiting Central American nations in preparation for disbanding the Contras and holding the Nicaraguan elections.

 Nothing could stop <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Bland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> from getting married Saturday, including the plane crash he survived and Hurricane Hugo, which wiped out both wedding site and honeymoon plans. The couple had to borrow a ring too. Theirs got lost in the mail. But four days of trauma ended Saturday night when the couple exchanged their vows. `` This is a very special occasion in ordinary circumstances, but it is a great occasion today,'' said <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, the pastor emeritus of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> Presbyterian Church. `` I honestly believe with all my heart that God spared your life,'' <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> told them at the altar. `` This wedding was intended to be.'' But it was n't intended to be smooth. <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banker, was on his way to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> for the wedding when his plane _ <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight 5050 to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> _ slid into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> while attempting to take off from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Two people died and 59 others were rescued. The plane went down with his luggage, inside which were his passport and tuxedo. Then came Hurricane Hugo, which threatened to slam into <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> all day Thursday. The hurricane hit in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, instead, but its path still managed to foul up the wedding plans. The couple had intended to spend part of their honeymoon in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, but the rioting and looting that followed <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> gave them pause `` We'll discuss it over breakfast,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> said. About 100 people attended the ceremony, and some of their friends got to help out with another last-minute problem. The wedding ring was lost in the mail and a new one had to be sent from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, but it arrived too late for the ceremony. `` We're just lucky our friends had a ring,'' <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> said afterward. The ceremony was over at last, and most of the guests had already gone on to the reception. The wedding party was delayed, however, because the limousine was a half-hour late. `` What else can happen?'' asked the bride's father, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bland </PERSON>. `` Is my car going to blow up?''

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> called Saturday for increased national and international efforts to fight the drug trade but said addicts should be treated with compassion. `` The various public institutions, on the national and international level, are called on to put a brake to the expansion of the market of narcotics substances,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said during a visit to a drug rehabilitation clinic on his three-day tour of <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION> in nordhern Irtaly. `` The interests that gain financially from such a trade must be brought to light,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` Then the instruments and mechanisms they use must be identified, and finally one will proceed to their coordinated and efficient dismantling.'' The pope, without mentioning any countries by name, said there is a need to promote development in those regions where residents depend on production of drugs for their livelihood. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also praised the work of rehabilitation clinics and social programs that offer addicts `` alternative models of life'' to lead them away from drugs and reintegrate them into society. `` Drugs are fought not only by health and judicial means but also _ and especially _ by installing new human relationships, rich in spiritual and tender values,'' he said. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said drug abuse is a `` clear symptom of a society that no longer succeeds in living true values and pushes those who use -LRB- drugs -RRB- into egoism and solitude.'' `` In this climate, the goals to pursue become money, power, career, consumer goods. One is ready to pay whatever price to obtain them,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday enacted an emergency ordinance barring price-gouging in this hurricane-ravaged city, where 5-pound bags of ice were being sold for $ 10 and long lines snaked outside stores that opened. `` It would be an unfair trade practice to charge something higher than pre-hurricane prices,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who called for the emergency legislation the council passed in a vote by telephone. `` If I hear of the instance of someone doing that, not only will they be arrested, but I will personally take pleasure in participating in the arrest,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Violators would be subjected to fines of $ 200 and jail terms of 30 days. The emergency ordinance is in effect until commerce returns to normal, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Authorities reported that gas at some locations was selling for $ 3 to $ 4.50 a gallon. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> cited the instance of ice being sold for $ 10. The state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> requested that merchants charge no more than $ 2 a bag. `` There is a problem with gouging,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state Emergency Preparedness Division. Long lines flowed from stores that managed to open Saturday, partly because police asked that no more than 10 people be allowed in stores at any one time. <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, manager of a Food Lion grocery store in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> that suffered only a few damaged ceiling tiles, said `` a couple of thousand'' customers showed up Saturday before the store was forced to close because it had no lights. Lines `` were going out the parking lot and into the street,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` It takes them about four hours to get into the store. `` It was hairy at times but it worked out all right,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` It was hot and people were irritated _ others were cutting in line.'' Cashiers used pocket calculators. People bought `` anything they could get their hands on,'' he said. And trucks outside gave dry ice to people, he said. A crowd hoping to get ice in the parking lot at the Citadel Mall started pushing and shoving and police were called, but there were no injuries or arrests, Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, some people were panicking over ice,'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said, noting that food could begin spoiling after two days without electricity. `` It was n't a riot, but it could have been,'' said Police Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, one of the first officers on the scene. `` There was some pushing and shoving, cursing, just some hot tempers.'' At another mall, motorists turned one lane of a road into a parking lot when they jumped out of their cars to get ice that was being given out. The city has been without electricity since Thursday, when Hurricane Hugo toppled power lines in much of the state, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. Restoring electricity `` may take a very long time,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` There's no electricity coming into the transmission lines and the generating capacity down here is gone.'' Utility crews from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> have been sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to help, he said. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said the city surveyed 2,000 buildings, one-third the total in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, and found 24 in varying degrees of collapse. He said there also were a number of collapsed chimneys in danger of sliding off sloped roofs and `` extraordinary'' tree damage in the city. Despite the difficulties, the mayor said he was inspired by the spirit in which <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> residents endured the hardships. `` Throughout the city today, people are upbeat and they are thankful,'' he said. `` They're thankful they're alive and that the city is essentially intact.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> expects Hurricane Hugo relief efforts to be the costliest in the organization's history, a spokesman said Saturday. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said the storm will cost the agency an estimated $ 38 million. `` We estimate that more than 73,000 people have received assistance to date, and this is just the beginning,'' <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> said at a news conference. More than 150 volunteers and paid disaster specialists will be brought into <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and other affected areas, he said.

 The driver of a truck that collided with a school bus and knocked it into a water-filled pit refused Saturday to answer questions about the accident that killed 20 teen-agers, an accident investigator said. Also Saturday, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said an examination of the truck's braking system found `` the brakes did work.'' The truck driver had told police after Thursday's accident that the brakes failed. On the advice of his attorneys, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 25, chose not to talk to <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> board members who are investigating the accident that injured at least 63 others, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s refusal will not hinder the federal probe, he added. An examination of the brakes found they were working, he said, but added that they were not perfectly adjusted. The truck passed state inspection last month, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. There were 81 aboard the bus when the accident occurred and the vehicle had a capacity of 83, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Investigators planned Sunday to question the driver of the bus, <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, who was in stable condition Saturday night at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>. One student still was listed in critical condition in Mission General's intensive care unit on Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the owner of the truck that rammed the school bus, offered Saturday `` to pay all medical and funeral expenses of the families involved in Thursday's tragic bus accident,'' according to a statement issued by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairley </PERSON>, manager of the McAllen-based company. Earlier Saturday, funerals were held for 15 of the 20 teen-agers who died in the accident. `` If you want to shout, shout. If you want to cry, cry,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Quezada </PERSON> told 4,000 people who crowded a funeral for four of the victims. `` If you want to strike your chest, those are all natural human reactions, but we need to transform the shouts and cheers into hope.'' The multitude, many of them standing, packed the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valle </LOCATION> cathedral for the funerals of <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 13, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Canales </PERSON>, 16, <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 14, and her cousin <PERSON> Yesenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 15. Many who attended the Mass at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valle </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from this border town of 3,700, did not know the girls but said they felt like they had lost some neighbors. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, said she attended because `` it felt like it was part of us. It felt like it was part of my family.'' <PERSON> Quezada </PERSON> asked the mourners `` not to wait for another tragedy for the opportunity to be close and loving to each other.'' Mariachi musicians played religious songs for the bilingual Mass. At another crowded Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in nearby Mission, about 400 family members and friends remembered <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Saenz </PERSON>, 14, and his brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 12. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> had escaped moments after the bus plunged into a water-filled pit, but died while trying to save his younger brother and others trapped in the submerged bus. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the bus tragedy was not God's will, but he asked God to help the community to accept the deaths of the 20 young people. `` We all know that something is terribly wrong and it just ai n't right that this terrible tragedy had to happen,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said `` It just does n't fit when the young people die and they carry their future with them before the Lord.'' A steady stream of curious <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> residents continued to drive past the accident site Saturday. Some parked their cars and got out to look at the pit. `` I have kids and I would n't like for my kids to go in the bus and have this happen,'' <PERSON> Evangelina </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pharr </LOCATION> said, standing with her four children. `` It would drive me crazy if one of my kids would drown.''

<HEAD>GOP Committee Decides Against Censuring Duke</HEAD>

 The state's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> committee on Saturday declined to censure state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> for his past as a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. The committee has no authority to kick <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> out of the party, but two committee members who worked on the censure said they had done so because of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s past of `` promoting racial violence, his anti-Semitism and his neo-Nazi philosophies.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, tried to introduce the resolution at the party's quarterly meeting. The resolution was tabled without debate. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, an advertising and media consultant, and <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON>, worked for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s, opponent, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, during the legislative campaign, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` Basically they ca n't accuse me of doing anything wrong. They ca n't question my stated platforms. They have to go back in my past,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, censured <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> after he won his legislative seat in February. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has shied away from any move to censure <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` They voted, in effect, that they do n't think it's proper to deal with it,'' state party chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nungesser </PERSON> said after Saturday's vote. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, joined the Klan in 1968 and left in 1980 after six years as Grand Wizard, a national post. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> later founded a group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he still heads.

 An investigation into the crash of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> Flight 5050 focused Saturday on the possibility of mechanical failure, although officials said the rookie co-pilot had punched the wrong cockpit button just before the craft plunged into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Investigators continued removing pieces of the plane's fuselage from the water off a runway at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. The parts will be examined to determine if there were any mechanical problems in addition to the pilot error, he said. Speaking of the co-pilot's mistake, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said, `` It may turn out that was unrelated to what happened.'' Another factor under investigation was the plane's unexplained veer to the left, acting <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said at a news conference Saturday night. He also said investigators found marks on the runway that showed the plane's three sets of wheels were skidding down the runway. The flight's pilot and co-pilot had their flight licenses suspended for leaving the accident scene and were strongly criticized Friday by federal officials for failing to immediately submit to drug and alcohol testing. `` At a time when drug abuse has become a major national problem, we believe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public has a right to know that its transportation system is alcohol and drug free,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. `` The failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug testing following a major accident is inexcusable,'' he said, echoing an angry statement by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the union that issued a statement defending the pilots Friday, offered no response Saturday to the testing comments or the suspensions. The pilots are not required by law to submit to testing after a crash. Pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 36, and co-pilot <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, 29, submitted to urinalysis Friday following five hours of questioning by federal investigators. The results of the tests were not available Saturday. Flight 5050 crashed into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> late Wednesday when its takeoff was aborted. Two people died and 59 others were rescued. The flight had been headed to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. At a news conference late Friday, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> revealed that <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> _ attempting his first operational takeoff of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 _ inadvertently pressed a button that caused the plane to decelerate <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> then accelerated the plane, but decided to abort the takeoff because the craft began drifting to the left and `` the pilot felt and heard a vibration which concerned him,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. He said Saturday that two passengers _ one of them a frequent flier _ told investigators they also felt the vibrations. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> believed he had enough room on the runway to stop the plane, but it instead skidded off the runway and into the water, cracking the fuselage into three sections. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> also said that, as the plane accelerated down the runway, the captain, acting as co-pilot, did not call out the jet's speed as required `` It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said investigators were trying to find out what made the plane drift to the left. Flight data recordings that would indicate the plane's actual speed when it aborted were still being studied. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> also noted the lack of experience in the cockpit, noting it was Kleissas' first actual takeoff on a 737-400 following completion of flight training. <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, 29, received his commercial pilot's license in October 1987 and an instructor's license six months later. His <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> record shows no previous problems, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 36, became a captain on July 1 and had flown only 138 hours in that capacity on the 737-400, though he had about 4,000 hours on 737s, mostly as a co-pilot <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> also said reports quoting <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> as saying that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> mumbled and appeared incoherent in the cockpit before the crash were not true, and <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> apologized for making those remarks. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> Saturday said that what <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> had heard was <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> reciting to himself a safety checkoff list.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s war on drugs is caught in a partisan battle in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, with Democrats trying to add prevention and treatment money and Republicans arguing the revision would weaken the defense budget. `` If we're not willing to spend $ 150 million more, this is no war,'' Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said Friday after a week of closed-door efforts to reach a compromise failed.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says it does n't really matter that a drug dealer was coaxed into selling crack cocaine near the White House _ just so the president could tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that's where the sale took place. `` The man went there and sold drugs in front of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, did n't he?'' the president told reporters in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Friday. `` That's the bottom line. That's what the man did.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> concede the drug dealer was maneuvered into making a previously arranged sale in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, across the street from the White House. The president displayed the cocaine in a see-through plastic bag in his nationally televised drug strategy speech on Sept. 5. He told the audience the crack had been `` seized a few days ago in a park across the street from the White House.''
