<HEAD>Congressman Says Former Aide Improperly Pocketed Funds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said Monday he has made `` mistakes in judgment'' while in office and that his former top aide who committed suicide had improperly pocketed campaign funds. The five-term Democrat from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> also said he was returning $ 18,000 in campaign contributions made by officials connected to a defense contractor. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said his former top aide and campaign manager, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, improperly pocketed nearly $ 7,300 in campaign funds. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> wrote $ 7,275 in checks to other <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> staff members and told them to give him the cash, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. `` I must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in judgment because <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> was my campaign manager,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. `` I was not aware that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was writing checks to staff members and asking them to cash those checks and return the cash to him.'' <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> committed suicide in May 1988 by jumping from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel following newspaper reports that were highly critical of his management of <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s congressional office. The apparent violations will be reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> also said he would return $ 18,000 in campaign contributions received from officials connected to <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of several defense contractors under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for suspected violations of contract procurement regulations. He said was returning the money because individual guilty pleas entered as a result of the investigation `` point to a systematic attempt on the part of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> to circumvent the federal laws governing campaign contributions,'' said <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, who sits on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with repsonsibility for approving the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. `` Mistakes were made by my staff. I have made mistakes of judgment,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> added. `` I regret the controversy these matters have caused, but I want the people of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to know that these were mistakes of the head, not of the heart.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the only two nations to acknowledge having chemical weapons, although up to a dozen, including <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are thought to have the grisly substances or the ability to make them, experts said Monday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, proclaimed his readiness to destroy 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapon stores if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agrees to the same stockpile level, and urged other nations to sign a multilateral pact to ban them entirely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, did not suspend production of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons, and his offer did not appear to go beyond legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> requiring the government to destroy old chemical weapons stocks by 1997. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said more than 20 nations have these weapons or the ability to mkake them. There was no immediate explanation of why his estimate was higher than those offered by the experts. The president's proposal `` might focus international attention on chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a disarmament lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But it may instead produce a U.S.-Soviet deal on chemical weapons and divert attention from production by other countries, he said. Private analysts believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 30,000 tons of chemical weapons. The Soviets have said they have `` no more than'' 50,000. Delegates to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament ended their most recent meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last month without any clear idea of when it would be possible to conclude a global ban on chemical weapons. The conference, which meets again in November, is stalled on the issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons, which experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make fertilizer or other compounds. `` The problem we have is that nobody has determined how to -LRB- monitor -RRB- it in an effectively verifiable way, because chemical weapons can be made in just about any kind of chemical plant,'' Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said earlier this year, before he was nominated chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. Also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles, and even the number of countries that have them. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials have said that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is building the world's largest chemical weapons plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has said the factory is designed to produce pharmaceuticals. In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used lethal chemical agents against Kurds along the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> border, although <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has not admitted it. Other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons are <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and probably <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a scholar who closely tracks the issue at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet stockpiles is not publicly known, although those two governments last weekend signed an agreement to exchange and verify data on their chemical arsenals, including the right to on-sight inspection. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has disclosed what type of weapons it has and where they are stored, but not the size of the stockpiles. The <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimated the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock at about 30,000 tons. In 1987, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, after an 18-year moratorium, began to manufacture a new generation of `` binary'' chemical weapons, which consist of two toxic substances that become lethal when mixed together. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also has ordered the destruction by 1997 of 90 percent of stockpiles of older <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons, stored at 11 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Work began on Aug. 31 at the <ORGANIZATION> Toole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> desert to destroy 42 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile, consisting of nerve and mustard gas, blistering agents that were used in World War I. Similar facilities were being studied at other storage sites to destroy the remainder. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile also consists of the nerve agents Sarin and VX, and other substances, according to the government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suspended chemical weapon production on Dec. 26, 1987, seven months after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> resumed production. Kremlin spokesmen, giving the first-ever Soviet figures on chemical weapon stockpiles, said they contained `` no more than 50,000 tons of chemical warfare agents.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates of Soviet stockpiles have ranged from 30,000 to 50,000 tons. In October 1987, the Soviets announced that their stockpile consisted of the nerve agents Sarion, <PERSON> Soman </PERSON>, VX, two mustard blistering agents and one irritant.

<HEAD>New Connie Chung Series Good Drama, Little Journalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the premiere of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' is typical of things to come, it might be wise for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to turn it into a docudrama anthology series and let <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> produce it. The show spent half its opening hour Saturday dramatizing the life of a fiery early civil rights pioneer in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. That half was a fairly good docudrama. But this is supposed to be a news series, even though this one's closing credits cited a `` soloist'' _ jazzman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>, who played the show's bluesy theme music It is not a good sign for a journalism show to have a news & amp; blues saxaphonist. But this effort's first 30 minutes were not a good sign, either. They made one fear that this series, produced by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lack </PERSON>, producer of the departed `` West 57th'' series, may prove just a training ground for TV news producers who hope to someday make TV movies. Entitled `` God's Bad Boy,'' Saturday's debut dramatization, set in 1949, featured seven actors; a group of black townsfolk as extras in <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>' church, the <ORGANIZATION> Dexter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and white extras as hostile policemen. By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the `` re-creation'' sporadically included brief interviews _ in the manner of the movie `` Reds'' _ with seven people who knew the late minister. They included his daughter, <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. There was an eighth interviewee, historian <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>. The first chapter of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on the civil rights movement, `` Parting the Waters,'' was the basis for the dramatization. The dramatization, in which <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> strongly and loudly spoke out against murder of blacks by whites and urged his middle-class congregation to stand up for black civil rights, was woefully weak in journalistic basics. Even <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, who has a reputation as a good reporter, exhibited this flaw in her non-acting role as anchor. She prefaced one scene by saying how `` a series of brutal murders of blacks by the police'' in the spring of 1949 led <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> to preach a sermon that `` would threaten the uneasy calm'' between the races in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. But she cited no examples of any murders by police. She only said that a white man got up off his front porch and shot and killed a black man who was running by. The killer's explanation, she said, was this: `` ` If he was running, he must have done something.''' She did n't say if the white man was charged with anything, let alone tried. In the docudrama, <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, in saying that `` a lot of people doing the killing'' of blacks are the police, at least cited two cases. They were found to be, he scornfully noted, `` justifiable homicide.'' But he named only one policemen while naming all the victims. It made you wonder if any of the names were real. In another scene, he was called `` boy'' by a white man identified only as a `` commonwealth's attorney'' in <LOCATION> Mongtomery </LOCATION>. No name was given. Another white official in a succeeding scene is identified only as `` Judge <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.'' In yet another scene, <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s daughter, in an off-camera interview excerpt that accompanied the on-screen drama, said that `` as I recall, a black girl had been raped. I think it was by six policemen.'' You'd think there be might be a question at this shocking point whether what she said actually happened, and whether any policemen were charged. But there was no question. On the bright side, the show's second half was an interesting panel discussion where sparks occasionally flew between the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Montgomery Mayor <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON>, the latter a white man. For the record, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> told viewers that next Saturday will bring `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, talking for the first time on television, about her separation from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and about her newest roles, both on-screen and off.'' It can be assumed that <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> will play herself.

 Police have imposed severe restrictions on a white anti-apartheid activist who won his freedom from detention by staging a 28-day hunger strike. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmeyr </PERSON>, 35, was detained without charge Aug. 26 while participating in a protest against <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, sponsors of an international rugby series that many activists viewed as a violation of the sports boycott imposed on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of its segregationist policies. <PERSON> Hofmeyr </PERSON>, a lawyer, drank only fruit juice during his detention, and relatives said he was on the verge of suffering permanent damage when the government agreed to free him Friday.

<BYLINE>Norwegians Come on Foot to `World's First' Drive-In Opera ^By DOUG

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Norwegian National Opera tried to bring 19th century arias to the masses this weekend with a drive-in performance. Many viewers, mostly on foot, found opera loud but hard to see. A 225-square-foot movie screen dangled from a crane above <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s Youngstorget marketplace for what was billed as the world's first drive-in opera Broadcast images of the opera's live Saturday night performance from its regular theater were dim, but stacks of loudspeakers blasted the normally quiet city center with crisp arias. `` It started as a crazy notion but we went ahead anyway,'' said state opera spokesman <PERSON> Terje </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON>. It was inspired by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drive-in movies, which are unknown in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, he said. `` We want people to know that opera can be fun,'' <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON> said of choosing one act from the 19th century comedy `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' for the experiment. The opera hoped 1950s Americana will help it shed a high-brow image and appeal to a broader public through the free, one night drive-in. Sponsors paid the $ 28,000 cost. Several operas in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and elsewhere asked to be kept informed of the results, <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON> said. Drive-in movie theaters are as foreign to most Norwegians as opera. Police estimated there was room for 250 cars in the closed-off marketplace. About 70 cars parked, many facing away from screen. Unsure of drive-in etiquette, `` one lady asked if she was allowed to get out of her car,'' said <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON>. Most of the roughly 1,300 people who passed through the square came on foot, often leading dogs or carrying children. A core of about 300 stayed through the 90-minute first act, politely applauding the screen. Some sat in chairs lined up on a truck's cargo bed. Nearby, limousine passengers sipped champagne. The second act proved too dark for television and plans to have waitresses on rollerskates serve hamburgers also proved impossible, <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON> said. `` It's wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingerbretsen </PERSON>, 48, an opera fan. `` The screen was dark ... but now people will buy tickets to a performance just to see what it is really like,'' she said. <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON> admitted picture problems but said `` sound was perfect and that's what counts ... Next time, we will have a performance lighted for television.'' <PERSON> Morten </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristoffersen </PERSON>, 16, who paused, looked and walked on, said, `` Great idea but it's hard to see ... I do n't think I'll be going to the opera anytime soon.'' But <PERSON> Baskerud </PERSON> said ticket sales to regular performances boomed during the drive-in. The opera, founded in 1957, already averages 90 percent bookings for 200 shows a year in its home, a cramped former movie theater, he said. The 1,119-tickets for the premiere had been sold out, yet when the curtain rose in the opera house many seats were empty. `` More than a third of the ticket holders stayed outside to watch the drive-in, then came in for the second act,'' he said. The Italian-language performance of <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>'s `` Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'', first performed in 1816, was directed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampe </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, and conducted by Italian <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cillareo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Iziar </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdos </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> resident of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, sang the female lead <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>, the Scottish opera's <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> sang Count <LOCATION> Almaviva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Trond </PERSON> <PERSON> Halstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> performed <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, with support from the opera's other 26 singers, 42-member chorus and 75-piece orchestra.

<HEAD>In East Harlem School District, Choice Triumphs, But Money Still
Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report. Education summit is Sept. 27-28.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Outside the battered metal doors of Intermediate School 117 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, crack vials litter the pavement and row after row of tenements stand empty and graffiti-scarred. But inside is what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called `` the single most promising idea'' in education _ an idea certain to be high on the agenda at the education summit this week between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The idea is `` choice'': the belief, as espoused by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others, that if parents are allowed to choose the best public schools for their children, the resulting competition would compel schools everywhere to improve. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> have already adopted `` open enrollment'' plans permitting parents to choose among schools throughout those states. Many other states offer more limited choice options aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic problems that only certain districts can handle. Scores of local districts have offered magnet and alternative programs for years. A Gallup education survey in August found Americans support the principle of school choice by a 60-31 margin, with 9 percent saying they were n't sure. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s plan, voluntary for two years, became mandatory this fall for districts with at least 1,000 students. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a law signed this year gives students the right to apply to any school in the state. They must stick with their choice for at least four years. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> this year passed a comprehensive open enrollment law permitting students aged 5 through 18 to choose schools across district lines as long as there is room and as long as it does n't upset desegregation efforts But advocates say no place offers better proof than <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> that choice's benefits can extend even to urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s neediest. In 1972, District 4 ranked last among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 32 school districts in reading and math achievement. Only 15 percent read at or above grade level. With federal and private funds, then-superintendent <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> gradually broke up or replaced existing schools in the district with magnet schools and alternative `` schools within schools,'' small enough to give students individual attention and academically attractive enough to draw pupils from all over the city. Some are selective, like the gifted programs or the school for the performing arts. Others take nearly all comers. The district has weathered some recent problems. Last December, superintendent <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> was suspended on allegations he and fellow board members funneled district money into a secret bank account and used it for trips, food, liquor and improper loans. And citywide school budget cuts may force reductions this year in some of the district's innovative magnet programs, said assistant superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Falco </PERSON>. Still, everyone agrees the district has been transformed for the better by the bracing effects of competition. Even <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has given only qualified support to the idea of choice, calls District 4 `` choice at its very best.'' Today, reading scores of District 4's 14,000 pupils rank 16th in the city, and 65 percent read at grade level or higher. Pupils can choose among 23 alternative schools specializing in such areas as science and humanities, performing arts and environmental science. Choice has also meant that poor programs which no longer attract students do n't last. A school specializing in maritime science was closed about three years ago, <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> said. It reopened recently with a new director. I.S. 117 was once a failing, impersonal middle school bulging with more than 2,000 students. It now houses four academies, or schools within schools, each occupying one floor and each with only about 200 pupils. There is a gifted and talented program; the `` Harbor School'' for the performing arts; the `` Career Academy,'' which helps poorly prepared students take a seemingly outlandish goal such as becoming a lawyer and plan how to attain it; and the `` Key School'' with classes of no more than 18 students and intensive instruction for youngsters with emotional difficulties. Most pupils come from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. But the magnet schools are so appealing that this once-downtrodden district is drawing students of all races and economic circumstances from every corner of the city. Nearly 200 children from around the city applied for 70 places in the entering class of the <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> this year, says assistant director <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. Fourth-grader <PERSON> Chenoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rommereim </PERSON> takes a car pool each day from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to attend I.S. 117's gifted program. She is one of the estimated 15-25 percent non-minority students in District 4 magnet programs, <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> said. Even staunch supporters of choice note its limitations. District 4 has shunned choice for elementary schools, <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> said, because at that early age it's more important for parents and children to maintain neighborhood ties. <PERSON> Sy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fliegel </PERSON>, an early architect of choice in District 4, recently wrote that choice worked in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> because it came gradually, one school at a time. And successful programs were kept small. It's far better to have parents clamoring for a few excellent programs than to offer lots of poor choices `` When I hear about a school district deciding to become a complete choice system in one blow, I worry,'' <PERSON> Fliegel </PERSON> wrote. And as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> education summit approaches, educators here greet their fame with a mix of pride and frustration. Some worry that District 4's accomplishments are being used to demonstrate that choice alone, without additional money, will fix the nation's schools. Few here believe that choice is an educational cure-all. `` In the final analysis the folks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seem to be saying: ` Federal dollars are n't necessary. What's needed is to have more schools like THAT one,''' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Batton </PERSON>, a computer and Spanish teacher who has been at I.S. 117 for 24 years. `` I have two feelings,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonet </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Northview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, a magnet school on East 116th Street specializing in computers and writing. `` It's very positive that people are noticing us. Let them notice. But send us more money.''

 It may not spark a revolution in men's wear in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but for the first time in years government officials are being allowed to shed their uniforms. A senior official said Sunday that government employees have been told they may dispense with their khaki uniforms in favor of civilian garb in their offices and at ceremonial occasions. The two-piece uniforms had been mandatory for employees of the military government, the ruling party and government-owned industries since 1985. Ethiopian television viewers were surprised to see members of the government delegation to recent talks with Eritrean rebels in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> dressed in suits and ties, a fashion long frowned on by the military men who seized control of the country in 1974.

<TEXT>
 Three decades ago, a West German politician said German reunification was a `` sleeping lioness'' that would awake one day with a mighty roar. Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Reunification is coming closer, but I ca n't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years,'' says West German conservative lawmaker <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>. `` We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.'' The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate. Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and something short of a categorical `` no'' from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic. `` If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' added the 44-year-old <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview. The West German constitution calls for a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were divided into East and West at the end of World War II. Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar European order mapped out by the conquering Allies. It is a prospect that creates unease in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s death and further Westernization of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> unilaterally abolishes the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact after guarantees from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> they will not join other alliances,'' the Times' futuristic view continued. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> withdraws from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>; and a referendum in both East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> votes for reunification and neutrality.'' That sort of talk is being heard more and more as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> loosens its hold on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and countries like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> explore democratic reforms. The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many, ominous. As much of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> heads towards its own unification in 1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _ 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is already <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest exporting nation, and despite its many flaws <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors. A unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of the Soviet bloc. Older generations recall eerie echoes of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> dictator <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s boasting that he had brought about `` the unity of the German nation.'' <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulesza </PERSON>, head of research for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, says she believes that `` as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` This new fear of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is linked to German economic trends. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is much stronger, much more dynamic than <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' she added. Since <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are at the front lines of two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. During a news conference last week in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that reunification is a `` matter for the Germans to decide.'' But he added: `` If that -LRB- reunification -RRB- was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests.'' For his part, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> evaded the issue during a news conference in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in June, saying only, `` the situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today was determined by historical realities.'' Outside <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue. `` In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,'' wrote commentator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s The Independent. `` The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.'' <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as chancellor in the 1970s, said <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity does n't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a `` hypothesis that can not be excluded. As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as people leave the country in near-record numbers. More than 100,000 East Germans are expected to resettle in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force. Little is likely to change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as long as the 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his aging comrades stay in power. During a September 1987 visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> called respect for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s present borders a basic condition of peace. `` Socialism and capitalism ca n't be any more united than fire and water,'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> added on the issue of reunification. There are virtually no indications that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West. The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' most brutal savagery. `` After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,'' member of Parliament <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, which he edits. The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness. Tired and weak, indecisive people in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are trying not to disturb her sleep,'' <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> predicted in 1955. `` The lioness will one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.'' Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauriac </PERSON>: `` I love <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.''

<HEAD>Captain Of Exxon Valdez Prepares Defense For Alaska Oil Spill Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>

 The man who was captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it caused the nation's worst oil spill now divides his time between lobstering on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and meeting with lawyers preparing his defense. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has refused interviews since the accident but his attorneys agreed to talk to The Associated Press and describe the captain's life as he awaits trial in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The trial is scheduled for Oct. 30. `` <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> feels terrible about the tragic accident,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON>, a prominent admiralty attorney who represents <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> a few days after his tanker struck a reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24, ripping its hull and releasing nearly 11 millions gallons of crude oil. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is saddened, <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON> says, by the environmental damage, the harm to wildlife and the hardship it caused fishermen and others. `` He loves <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' and had seriously considered two job offers there before the accident, according to <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, outlined their client's account of the accident. They contend the accident was the result of the failure of third mate <ORGANIZATION> Gregory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cousins </ORGANIZATION> or helmsman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>, or both, to properly carry out <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s orders. They assert that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was not drunk when the accident occurred, and said not one witness testified at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearings that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was intoxicated. His blood alcohol level was tested about 10 hours after the grounding and found to be 0.061 percent, 50 percent higher than the legal limit for a seaman operating a vessel. He has had a history of alcohol abuse and has lost driver's licenses in two states because of intoxication. The attorneys said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had moved his ship out of shipping lanes to maneuver around ice. They said he told Cousins to bring the tanker back into the lanes and went to his cabin to do paper work, but the return to the shipping lanes was delayed and Cousins' directions to set the rudder to clear the reef were not carried out <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> now faces up to 12 years in prison and $ 150,000 fines if convicted of the criminal charges of reckless conduct which resulted in the spill. `` He has a very positive outlook on life although he is apprehensive about the upcoming trial,'' said <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON>, a schoolmate of <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Schuyler </LOCATION>. `` He hopes the people of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have n't prejudged him on the inaccurate reports they've read in the newspapers and seen on television,'' he said. In the meantime, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has faded into a quiet life at home in the tree-lined community of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, on the north shore of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 50 miles from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. He, his wife, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>, and their 13-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, have kept pretty much to themselves, occasionally inviting friends and family over for a barbecue. His spirits are good. He has received hundreds of letters from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and around the world, many of them from children; the letters have become more supportive in recent months. To relax, he enjoys sailing his 16-foot catamaran. He also is an avid reader and history buff, devouring any book on the sea. He is said to be an expert on a famous seafarer, Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who explored the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast in the late 1770s. The sailing master for <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s voyage was Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>; it was <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> that the Exxon Valdez struck. <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> was later promoted to captain. The crew of his ship, the <LOCATION> Bounty </LOCATION>, mutinied in 1789 and set him adrift. He survived, returned to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and, in 1791, resumed his naval career. Like <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> wants to return to the ocean. `` Right now, he is eager to get back to the profession he knows and loves: His work as a captain at sea,'' <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> got a special present for her 102nd birthday _ the chance to add another `` great'' to her name. Just hours before her birthday party at Oak Manor Nursing Home, her great-great granddaughter <PERSON> Leandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> gave birth to a daughter. The 6-pound, 12-ounce girl, Mrs. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>'s great-great-great-granddaughter, was named <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> Family and friends helped celebrate the double birthday Saturday with a large cake, cookies and punch at the nursing home. `` We had two candles on the table,'' said <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 62, a daughter from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` And we sang ` Happy Birthday.''' She said her mother was in good spirits, and just as lively as she was on her 101st birthday and at a big Mother's Day party attended by about 100 people. Mrs. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> was born Sept. 23, 1887, near <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 There were only a few true Texans on hand, but the tomato-throwing troops representing the Lone Star state conquered <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s partisans in the annual Colorado-Texas Tomato War. About 6,000 pounds of overripe tomatoes were tossed Saturday in the contest, a sort of statement by longtime residents against outsider-driven development at the nearby resort of <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>. `` I used to own a hotel in the area and one day a woman from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> looked out over the mountains and said, ` Sure is pretty out there _ too bad someone ai n't done nothing with it,''' explained <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, originator of the event. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestring </PERSON>, one of the few true Texans in this year's battle, found the fun wore a bit thin `` It is really lonely,'' she said. `` I offered some of them my Lone Star beer but no one would drink it.''

 There's really nothing new under the collar, despite what may have been written about the `` latest'' in necktie knots. <PERSON> Delos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinze </PERSON> says he was surprised to read a newspaper story that touted as innovation the idea of tying a <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> knot by starting with the cravat inside-out. The Shelby knot has caught the eye of the national press since being praised by a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> television newsman. `` I've been tying it that way for 35 years,'' <PERSON> Hinze </PERSON> said. `` It just bothered me.'' The novelty was supposed to have been proven by its absence from a reference guide from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neckwear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> called `` Getting Knotted _ 188 Knots for Necks.'' But <PERSON> Hinze </PERSON> dug up a booklet he got from a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> clothing store in the 1950s, and there it was, on Page 6. The booklet from <ORGANIZATION> Johnnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walkers </ORGANIZATION> clothing calls it a reverse half-Windsor. The store's still around, but the present staff is n't interested in laying claim to the knot. `` I do n't think people care too much about how they tie a tie,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Walkers </PERSON> vice president. `` I'm left handed,'' said his store manager, <PERSON> Argil </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirbel </PERSON>, `` so I've always tied it this way.''

 Fifteen-year-old <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> is in reform school after confessing to killing four neighbors. Those connected with the case hope he gets help there _ fast _ because he'll be released by the time he turns 21. The stocky, barrel-chested youth was sentenced to six years in the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after pleading guilty Thursday to the Labor Day weekend murders of a mother and her two young daughters, and the 1987 killing of a woman who lived two doors from him. Before he was taken away, <PERSON> Price </PERSON> told his friends outside the <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Courthouse: `` Later. When I get out I'm going to smoke a bomber.'' While justice moved swiftly in the Sept. 1 killings _ Price was arrested two weeks after the slayings and pleaded guilty four days later _ some are not convinced the punishment that will allow him to be freed by age 21 fits the crime. State Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, who pushed unsuccessfully for legislation to allow prosecutors to try juveniles under age 16 who face capital charges as adults, expressed frustration that the sentence was the maximum allowed under state law. `` It's a crying shame that it takes a tragedy to wake ... a community up,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. Police Capt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Price told investigators he broke into a home two blocks away Sept. 1 to steal whatever he could, and killed three people because he was afraid they would identify him. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>, 39, and her two daughters, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 8, had been severely beaten and stabbed. Several of Ms. <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>'s ribs were broken, and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s skull was fractured. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the viciousness of the crimes led police to link the killings with that of <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 27, was stabbed 58 times the night before she was to move from the neighborhood. Investigators said the 240-pound Price, who was repeating the ninth grade, never showed any remorse for the killings. `` Iron Man,'' as the football-playing Price was known at school, had a history of run-ins with the law. He had been placed on probation for assaulting his sister two days before the Heatons were killed, and he was put on probation last fall for burglary.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 4,600 judges, facing persistent death threats from drug traffickers, said Sunday they would strike if the government does n't give them better protection. Also Sunday, the army said it had captured a suspected drug trafficker wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for extradition. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> is not on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of 12 most wanted drug traffickers. The son of a crusading newspaper editor killed by drug traffickers said Sunday that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s congress is cowardly and corrupt in the government's fight against drug traffickers. Three bombs exploded late Sunday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital city of 6 million, heavily damaging offices of three savings and loans companies but causing no injuries, national police said. Late Saturday, bombs exploded in a theater, a city bus company's garage and at a neighborhood headquarters of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, injuring two people, police said In the last month, 103 bombs have killed six people and wounded 130. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judges, fearing for their lives, said in a statement issued through their labor union, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, that they will go on strike if immediate action is not taken to address the dangers they face. Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed. According to the union, at least 1,600 of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 5,000 judges have been threatened with death in the last 12 months. Union officials were to meet Monday with acting Justice Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>. `` We do n't see any will on the part of the government to increase security for our lives,'' union president <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> said in the communique. The judges repeated previous demands for bulletproof cars and vests, guards with metal detectors at their offices and other security measures. Judges in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> earn about $ 400 a month. In interviews last month many said they were forced to take buses to work because they could n't afford cars. A compact car here costs $ 20,000. <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, who resigned as justice minister last week after being threatened by drug traffickers, said she was promised $ 19 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid earlier this month for the purpose of protecting judges. But the union said it has heard nothing since about the aid. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s army said Sunday it had captured a suspected drug trafficker wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for extradition. The army's 2nd Brigade, in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast town of <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, said it had captured <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. It said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> has been wanted on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since 1985. Last month, Colombian government security forces claimed to have arrested two Colombians wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for extradition. The two were released after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had no charges pending against them. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and other embassy employees have refused to comment on extraditions. The anti-drug crusading newapaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, in a column by its editor, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, accused <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s congress Sunday of being cowardly and corrupt. `` It is not a very admirable congress. Better yet, it is cowardly ...,'' <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said in a signed column in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily. His father, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, was killed by drug traffickers in 1987 after the newspaper called on the government to crack down on the traffickers. `` We have finally hit bottom,'' the column said Sunday, in the harshest criticism of the congress ever published in a newspaper. Colombian newspapers have said 25 Colombian congressmen have been denied visas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of links to drug traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has denied comment, but the reports have caused a furor in the congress. One of the country's biggest drug trafficking suspects, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, was an alternate member of <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 until 1986. An alternate member votes during the absence of a congressman, which happens frequently in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Four years ago a federal senator was accused of receiving drug traffickers' money for his campaigns, but an investigation was dropped when a bank microfilm supposedly showing receipt of the funds disappeared. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> has remained in the forefront of the war on drugs. On Sept. 2, a 500-pound car bomb exploded near the paper's plant, seriously damaging its press and other equipment. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a retired army officer wanted in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in connection with the training of drug-cartel militias claimed Sunday that an Israeli Embassy official offered to smuggle him from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> for $ 10,000. Retired Lt. <PERSON> Col </PERSON> <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Biran </PERSON>, the security chief at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, offered to smuggle him out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in April after threats on <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s life were reported in the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> media. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the claim was `` totally unfounded'' and that <PERSON> Biran </PERSON> would remain at his post.

 More than 450 years after the church tried <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galilei </ORGANIZATION> for heresy, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> came to the astronomer's hometown and pronounced the words many Pisans have longed to hear: <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was right and the church was wrong. The pope had previously said the Inquisition erred in condemning <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun. But his statements during a weekend trip to this Tuscan city were viewed by its citizens as <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s official rehabilitation. Speaking Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pisa </ORGANIZATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> studied and taught in the late 1500s, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he wanted to recall some of the school's illustrious alumni _ `` above all the very great Galileo.'' Shortly after his arrival in <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> on Friday night, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> stood on a bridge over the <LOCATION> Arno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, illuminated by flickering candles, and declared: `` How can one not recall the name of that great man who was born here and from here took the first steps toward immortal fame? `` <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galilei </ORGANIZATION>, whose scientific work, imprudently opposed at the beginning, is now recognized by all as an essential step in the methodology of research and, in general, on the path toward the knowledge of the world of nature.'' Born in 1564, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> originally aroused antagonism when, as a professor at the university from 1589 to 1592, he initiated experiments on the laws of bodies in motion which contradicted the accepted teachings of <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>. But he was most widely known for his support of the Copernicus system, which taught that the sun is the central body and the earth and the other planets revolve around it. That defied the church-held belief that the earth was the center of the universe. In 1616, the church denounced the Copernicus system as dangerous to faith, summoned <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and warned him not to uphold or teach it. But he published a book supporting the theory in 1632. The next year he was summoned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, tried by the Inquisition and forced to abjure his beliefs. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> was sentenced to life imprisonment, which was later changed to house arrest. He died in 1642 near <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has often spoken out on <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf. In 1979, less than a year after his election as <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, he urged the international scientific community to examine the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> case, saying he hoped it would help remove the `` diffidence that still prevents fruitful harmony between science and faith, and between the church and the world.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> appointed a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> commission in 1979 to study the case. Five years later, the <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> issued documents from secret <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> archives, including details of the Inquisition proceedings, which uphold <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>. In his speech at the university on Sunday, the pope did not address the Galileo case specifically. But he noted that religious faith and science have often been at odds throughout the centuries. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> warned of potential moral and ethical abuses of modern science but said faith and research are not incompatible. `` The church trusts, promotes and encourages your task,'' he said.

 The roll call of six combat photographers who died in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> evoked painful memories and tears at a memorial honoring them and 57 other journalists who were killed covering that war. _ <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Huet </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, killed in 1971 when the helicopter in which they were flying was shot down while they were covering a South Vietnamese offensive in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, killed in an ambush two days before the war ended in 1975; he was the last western journalist killed _ <PERSON> Kyoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawada </PERSON>, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, killed in an ambush in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1970 _ <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> <PERSON> My </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> photographer, killed in a battle in the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 After My was killed, his brother, <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON> `` Nick'' Ut, then only 17, took his place with the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Eight years later, <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION> won a Pulitzer Prize for his photo of a horrified <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> girl running naked down a highway after a napalm strike by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> bombers seared her body. Ut, now based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was among the more than 200 photographers, staff members and guests at the second-annual <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> workshop who honored the journalists Sunday in this year of the 150th anniversary of photography. `` I wish my mother and brothers and sisters -LRB- still in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB- would have been here to share this unforgettable moment and place where our fallen comrades including my beloved brother are posthumously being commemorated,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION> said in prepared remarks. `` I am at this very minute feeling very humble and very proud of the achievements and sacrifices sustained by our fallen colleagues including my brother.'' Ut was so choked with emotion that he was unable to speak and asked a colleague to read his remarks. `` I saw my brother's name and I could not speak,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION> said afterward. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> also paid tribute to the fallen journalists. `` They made the ultimate sacrifice in recording history for people of all countries throughout the world,'' Commandant <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said in a message delivered by a staff member. `` Our nation owes these journalists and photographers its honor, gratitude and respect.'' The ceremony was the idea of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Pulitzer-Prize winner himself. It was held on a hilltop on his workshop-farm in the Catskills around a slate table inscribed with the first names of the six photographers who were his best friends. Six small blue spruce trees were planted around the table, one for each of the photographers. A seventh tree was planted in honor of the other journalists killed in the war. Then, the men and women who had gathered, some who were only toddlers during the Vietnam War, some with tears in their eyes, lifted their champagne-filled glasses and toasted the fallen.

<HEAD>Pierce Faces Legal and Public Relations Challenge in HUD Testimony</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> faces a daunting legal and public relations challenge when he appears Tuesday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating his old agency, say lawyers who have helped many witnesses cope with sometimes-hostile congressional inquiries. Potential pitfalls, even for the most blameless witness, range from bad publicity to a perjury indictment. `` It's a very difficult forum,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Abbe </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>. `` There are fewer rules to protect witnesses than in a court or even a grand jury. The power structure is very one-sided.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has been subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee to testify about alleged influence-peddling and mismanagement at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, an agency he ran for eight years. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers, has questioned the subcommittee's fairness and complained that there is not enough time to prepare <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to testify. While not disclosing specific strategies, <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said, `` I assure you, I am not going to let my client get kicked around.'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel `` seems to have made up its mind that my client was involved in some wrongdoing despite the fact there is not a shred of evidence to support such a finding.'' `` In light of this, I must consider every viable and reasonable professional option,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> asked expert lawyers what advice they would give to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Their advice: _ Listen to the questions and limit any answer to what you know to be the facts Do not be afraid of qualifying any answer. _ Anticipate what might be asked, and focus on the facts known about those issues _ Be prepared to tell your story in a clear, concise and consistent way _ Be aware of potential criminal charges, and of your right to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination _ Be aware of the news media attention your appearance will generate The subcommittee is expected to question <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> about his role in a number of controversial agency decisions to provide funding for projects supported by well-connected Republicans. `` To some degree, it's like preparing for any testimony,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who 16 years ago served as assistant chief counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating the Watergate scandal. `` But there are peculiarities of the forum with which you must deal.'' <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who has represented congressional witnesses, noted that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s legal team already has laid a foundation for the former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer's refusal to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. `` Only in rare circumstances would it be advisable for an individual who has potential criminal exposure to testify,'' he said. `` By maintaining that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not allowing enough time to determine whether their client has a criminal problem, it becomes very reasonable for a witness to rely on his Fifth Amendment right even if convinced he did nothing wrong,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. If <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> invokes his right not to answer the panel's questions, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> added, `` He has to bite the bullet and take the adverse publicity. It may raise the specter, although in theory it should not, that the guy has something to hide.'' Late Friday, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> exercised his right under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules for any subpoenaed witness to have all news media cameras and microphones banned from the hearing room. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said that if he were advising <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, he, too, would have advocated that move. Another option is testifying in executive session, with the public excluded, but that tack is subject to the subcommittee's discretion `` It's important for a witness' lawyer to know the rules of the particular committee,'' said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. `` For example, can the witness make an opening statement?'' <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said the paucity of ground rules forces a witness' lawyer to be more aggressive. Attorneys like <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was often combative when representing <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> during testimony before a congressional committee about the Iran-Contra affair, `` often have to depend on the strength of their will to protect their clients,'' <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> agreed, noting that in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, unlike in court, `` there are very few restrictions on what are viewed as relevant questions _ almost anything is relevant in this forum.'' The experts said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, if he chooses to testify, faces a thorny problem _ the threat of being accused of perjury _ if his memory fails him or he falls into what <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> called the common trap of `` remembering things in a way that reflects favorably on you.'' `` And if his testimony disagrees with that of another witness, it's a matter of who is believed,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Shift Leaves Some Contras Out in the Cold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s shifting political landscape has produced a more tolerant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and deepening hostility toward some Contra rebels who once enjoyed red-carpet access here, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and rebel sources The changed attitude toward the Sandinista government has been subtle compared with the mutual recriminations and finger-pointing that now characterize the relationship between the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and some elements of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s exiled opposition. By de-emphasizing military pressure against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has moved away from the confrontational policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and is now pursuing peaceful but guarded coexistence. The shift has embittered some Contras. `` No one in the resistance trusts the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a rebel spokesman who is closely allied with veteran Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> was once a regular visitor to the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years but nowadays is treated almost as an outcast by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> maintains that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has refused even to answer rebel correspondence while abandoning the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of avoiding all substantive contact with Sandinista leaders. When a congressional delegation met recently with President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official participated. Amid the ongoing debate over when the Contras should disband, <ORGANIZATION> Matamoros </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` seems more interested than the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in demobilizing the resistance.'' One continuing source of concern for the administration is Soviet bloc military aid for the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>, estimated at $ 350 million for the first eight months of this year. The administration view is that the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leadership mantle has passed from Miami-based civilians to battle-hardened <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> field commanders who have risen through the ranks and are far more qualified to represent the armed opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Officials talk disdainfully of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer-financed Contra bureaucracy which has operated for years in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Matamoros accused <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials of grossly exaggerating the size of the Contras' paid staff. By turning its back on <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> civilian leaders who have refused to return to the region and by favoring the emerging military commanders within the resistance, <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> says the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is tacitly advocating a military coup despite its stated preference for civilian supremacy. The administration's twin objectives for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are to support the internal opposition there as the country gears up for national elections and to keep the armed resistance intact until after the Feb. 25 balloting. The bulk of the rebel force is based at camps along the Honduran border, living off U.S.-supplied humanitarian assistance. Central American presidents have called for the demobilization of the rebels by Dec. 5 but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration regards that deadline as irrelevant because the presidents also said that any such process must be voluntary. The administration believes that the presence of rebel forces along the border serves as an incentive for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to fulfill their promise of a free and fair election. At the same time, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to devise a way to assist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s fledgling democratic process without providing direct support to the campaign of the principal opposition candidate, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the administration seems willing to live with a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> victory provided the process is reasonably honest. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> likens the more permissive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the appeasement policies that led to World War II. `` Rather than pressing for military assistance, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> joked about relocating the Contras to his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranch,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> has written. Such an attitude, he said, could deprive <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of democracy while damaging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security interests in region.

<HEAD>Complaints, Not Agreement, Emerge From Talks on Strategic Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Lawmakers thrashing out a fiscal 1990 defense plan are looking toward <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on a military spending bill to help break the impasse over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget request for strategic weapons. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees, meeting behind closed doors on authorization legislation, have made no progress on resolving their differences over funding levels for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, land-based nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber. Complaints, rather than agreement, have emerged after three weeks of negotiations. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still has n't learned to do math,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., one of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees `` They want everything and take it off somebody else's budget.'' `` The thing is going nowhere,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferee, said Friday. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> came to the negotiations with a series of votes that were `` all over the lot They both accepted and rejected every strategic program. `` This is one of the most difficult ones -LRB- conferences -RRB- I've ever been in,'' he added. Initially, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were far apart on the major strategic programs. _ On Star Wars, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 4.5 billion, a slight cut in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 4.9 billion The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted a budget of $ 3.1 billion for the missile shield. _ On the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 1.1 billion for the MX and $ 100 million for the Midgetman The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cut $ 502 million from the MX program and eliminated all money for the Midgetman. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> made a modest cut of $ 300 million in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 4.7 billion proposal for the stealth bomber, the bat-winged aircraft that at a cost of $ 530 million a copy has caused sticker shock The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limited production of the radar-evading plane to four over the next two years _ half of what the administration requested. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> presented a revised proposal that restored the MX money, left out the Midgetman and called for the chamber's lower funding total on Star Wars, according to congressional sources The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the plan. A counterproposal that left the original <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill relatively intact was quickly turned down by the House. Setting the tone for future <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiations on strategic weapons will be <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, scheduled to get under way today, on a $ 288.2 billion military spending bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved about $ 3.7 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Star Wars program, which amounts to last year's level plus inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans are expected to introduce amendments to raise the funding level for Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, to at least something closer to the authorization total. But their efforts may have been hurt by a statement from the administration released Friday. The Office of Management and Budget complained about the restrictive language the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> put into the bill which requires that $ 820 million of the $ 3.7 billion be used for research on laser and particle beams. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., sponsor of the amendment, expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice long-term research on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment along the lines of the so-called `` Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored by many in the administration In its statement, the administration `` urged restoration of the requested funding levels.. and removal of the restrictive SDI language,'' but unlike a previous statement on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations legislation, there was no veto threat `` That will be a key test vote,'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speaks on that issue it puts into cement what the figure would be.'' And the hope, according to <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, is that a decision on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> will trigger a chain reaction of agreement on the other strategic programs. `` Once the SDI number is resolved others will not easily fall in place but likely will,'' he said.

 The commander of the local army garrison knows the guerrillas will be back. They have attacked this mud-brick town a few miles from a major air base three times this year but have not taken it. After each foray they evaporate into the hills or surrounding villages. It is a tactic repeated throughout most of the country. `` They are not so near as they were before, but I do n't know exactly where they are,'' Col. <PERSON> Mobine </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurzi </PERSON> told reporters flown to <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> this month to refute guerrilla claims of capturing it. He said at least 100 guerrillas were killed in the latest, weeklong assault on <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION>, about 425 miles southwest of the capital city of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and about 90 miles east of the border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where some guerrillas are based. But one soldier told reporters, `` They really pounded us before withdrawing. How do we know how many were killed?'' After the Soviets withdrew their troops in February, the U.S.-backed guerrillas were predicting their easy capture of provincial centers like <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, if not <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> itself. Now seven months later, their military campaigns remain primarily the hit-and-run attacks that successfully drove the Soviets out. But guerrilla tactics are not going to win the guerrillas a civil war against the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government or even much leverage at the bargaining table. And the fatigue with the war rampant in the civilian population after 10 years of fighting and 1 million deaths is also infecting the mujahedeen guerrillas, or Islamic holy warriors. `` The mujahedeen have the capacity to harass the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, but they are not going to win the war,'' said an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking on condition on anonymity. `` The average commander, the average fighter is tired,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official. `` There is battle fatigue, there is no doubt.'' Yet the war wears on and the mujahedeen control most of the countryside. Pilots on the runway in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, fearing guerrilla rockets, taxi at 100 mph. Troops at the last checkpoint in north <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the supply lifeline from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, report it was recently closed by guerrilla attacks for a few hours on several occassions. There is constant low-level combat that occasionally flares into full-scale battles. At the daily press briefings, the government spokesman reports a litany of `` sweeping and mopping up operations'' throughout the provinces bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where most of the mujahedeen are headquartered. The repetition indicates the mujahedeen can not be swept away but that the government is confident they can be kept at bay for the most part. `` Despite the attempts of the extremists, the situation in the country is by and large calm,'' President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> recently told a group of foreign visitors. He referred with bravado to the massive supply convoy that just arrived in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>: `` Such a convoy rarely could exist even in the presence of the Soviet troops.'' But weeks of conflicting reports about when the 1,000 or so vehicles would arrive indicated it had run into trouble. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryalai </PERSON>, the first deputy prime minister in charge of supplies, said earlier that the group of trucks was bogged down by guerrilla rocket fire on the last 90 miles before <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. It was not constant, he said, but prevented moving ahead. The mujahedeen claimed to have knocked out 110 trucks, while the government said it lost three trucks and a tank. It said a year's supply of ammunition got through The convoy apparently veered off hundreds of miles into the desert to avoid the attacks, eventually taking more than three weeks to cover the 360 miles from the town of <LOCATION> Torgundi </LOCATION> on the Soviet border. While sporadic attacks can interrupt supply routes, the guerrillas have been unable to take a major town. A concerted attack on <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, about 24 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> border, threatened the city briefly late last month. But diplomats said the mujahedeen lacked the sustained supply routes needed to overcome government forces surrounded by dense minefields and tanks. `` It is difficult for the mujahedeen to capture anything,'' said another <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` They were trained as a guerrilla force and they are trained to make conventional attacks. They lack heavy artillery, air support.'' The government uses both heavily. Dawn in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is punctuated by outgoing Scud and other missiles. Spotting Scud trails at night is a favorite activity at diplomatic parties. The Scuds, with a range of 180 miles are used against mujahedeen positions along the border. To knock out guerrilla positions around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Frog-7 missiles with a range of about 48 miles were deployed late last month. The Continental Hotel, where most foreigners stay, shakes daily from a nearby missile battery. The mujahedeen leaders in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have so far refused negotiations. But there are only six weeks left before winter weather sets in and most military activity stops because mountain trails are impassable. Said one ambassador, quoting a visiting Englishman during the wars of the last century: `` the only time the Afghans are at peace is when they are fighting.''

 As a caricature, the entomologist is often portrayed as a wispy, bespectacled man wearing tropical shorts and pith helmet chasing exotic butterflies with a long-handled net. Sure, some of them do things like that. But many others perform painstaking work that non-entomologists would see as sheer drudgery _ the meticulous slow work of scientists. `` They save us a lot of grief,'' says <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an information specialist in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s main science agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They certainly make life easier for us by studying these insects, the good ones as well as the bad ones.'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, in a recent telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, office, is one of those attending a two-day conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday and Wednesday that will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Entomological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Entomologists are intense about their experiments, he said. For example, when they observe a parasite lay eggs in a destructive beetle, for example, `` it's like they're watching their kids do a virtuoso concert ... they really get excited.'' But some entomological research `` is so plodding, such as categorizing and cataloging insects,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` But, yet, they're very, very interested in what they're doing.'' Today's society dates from the founding in 1889 of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entomologists </ORGANIZATION>, and the 1906 beginning of the <ORGANIZATION> Entomological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The two were merged, adopting the latter's name, in 1953. The society, a non-profit educational group, says it is the largest international association of entomologists, with more than 8,700 members. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, who claims his only experience with entomology is `` swatting flies and spraying cockroaches,'' said the society hopes for an attendance of around 350 at its centennial symposium this week. Some members from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> are expected to attend the sessions held at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Menn </PERSON>, associate deputy area director for the <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s research center in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, said the symposium is unique in that it is directed at an intended audience of `` decision makers who are not familiar with entomology.'' <PERSON> Menn </PERSON> said the sessions will be geared to legislators, federal and state officials, industrial representatives, news media and other non-entomological persons. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhauer </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>'s department of entomology, College Park, said more than 15 authorities `` on all aspects of insect-related research worldwide'' are on the program A few of the program highlights provided by the society, which calls itself ESA, illustrate what <PERSON> Steinhauer </PERSON> meant: In the first session, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> will talk about `` unraveling the secrets of insect life.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is a pioneer researcher of insect development biology. `` He developed several novel techniques for performing surgery on insects,'' the society said. `` One, which uses carbon dioxide anesthesia, was adopted the world over.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is the world's leading authority on insect defenses and communication. His topic is the insect as a chemist, describing the ingenious ways insects use odors, poisons, plants and disguises to repel or injure a predator. `` Societies: Insect and Human'' is the topic of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who is called the father of modern sociobiology and is an expert on ants. He says biological laws are the basis of social behavior among ants and humans. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> won a Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction in 1979 for `` On Human Nature,'' about the influence of genetically determined pattens of human behavior. Other sessions will include talks on entomology in the developing world, insects in agriculture, the impacts of insects on public health, applying biotechnology to entomology, and policies for the future. Looking ahead, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mclean </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> will describe entomology in the 21st century. He is an expert on the relationship between several insects and the diseases they cause on many important crops.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a hot-line for foliage watchers. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>, director of timber management research for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the hotline carries a recorded message featuring areas of `` especially beautiful fall color'' as they occur in national forests throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The hotline began operation on Sept. 15 and will continue through the fall season, he said. The number is -LRB- 202 -RRB- 475-3780. <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> said some pockets of fall color are occurring earlier than usual this year, which could be due to unusual temperatures, moisture or drought. `` Where I live, in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the wet spring and early summer followed by almost drought-like conditions in August, have triggered some early fall color, especially at the higher elevations,'' he said. But most color changes are caused by the longer nights and shorter days. `` Most people think frost plays a major role in the beautiful colors,'' <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> said. `` Cooler weather can be a factor, but color changes are primarily brought on by the increasing hours of darkness that accompany the fall season.'' Many of the vivid colors are in the leaves year-round but are hidden by dominant green color during the summer months. As autumn approaches, the chlorophylls _ which produce the green as sunlight is used to produce plant food _ decrease and the other pigments are apparent. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is famed for its foliage splendor, but <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> said there are opportunities for viewing magnificent colors in most of the states. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> alone offers 65 species of trees that produce color, more than any other state, he said. The Rocky Mountains offer the splendor of the quaking aspen, and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> has the western larch, which <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> said is `` an unusual deciduous conifer whose needles turn yellow and drop from the tree.''

<HEAD>Despite New Friends, Crowe Still Has Wary View of Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A good number of Soviet military caps have been added to the collection of Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, and a sword-wielding statue of Mother <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> stands guard on his Pentagon desk. But the nation's premier military leader says that despite the new spirit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation he's helped foster, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must be aware that Soviet military power has not abated. `` The same thing we feared for years is essentially still there,'' the admiral observed in an hour-long interview looking back over his 43 years in active duty. This week marks the end of <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s four-year tenure as chairman and principal military advisor to the president. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to attend a last salute to <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> on Friday at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the admiral's alma mater. Army Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week to succeed <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> on Oct. 1. At 52, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is the youngest person and first black to hold the post. Much has changed during his time in the military, the admiral noted. `` When I came to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, you never heard of lasers, you never heard of nuclear power, you never heard of missiles, you never heard of pantyhose, you never heard of VCR's, and you did n't have very sophisticated deodorants,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said The last item in particular, he said with a laugh, has made an amazing improvement in `` the quality of life'' aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. The admiral's job switch comes as <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> has put in motion some of the most extensive military-to-military exchanges with the Soviets since the two nations were allies in World War II. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> also has overseen the introduction of congressionally ordered reforms that made him the leader of the chiefs of the nation's military services, not just their spokesman. The 64-year-old admiral spent 10 days in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in June, and hosted a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year by his Soviet counterpart, Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>. The admiral, whose speech still bears a twang from his <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> roots, adopted an affectionate tone when he spoke of his counterpart. `` I've become very friendly with Marshal <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>. I've enjoyed my association with him, my talks with him, his wisdom and his feeling for his country,'' the admiral said The two men intend to continue their contacts even after he leaves office, he added. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> was able to see military facilities that had been barred to Westerners for years. He visited sites that drove home the Soviet's huge losses in World War II, such as the massive statue that marks the lengthy battle with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, a turning point in the war. `` That's the memorial _ <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said as he pointed to the replica figure on his desk. The stern-looking woman, holding high a saber, is exhorting her sons to rise in the defense of their homeland. `` It's so big, you can see it for miles,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> recalled. The admiral said his outstanding impression from the exchange is that people in both nations `` enjoy a lot in common _ they want to live in peace, they want their families to be better off, they want their children to have a better life than they did.'' But the chairman noted that despite Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s touted military budget cuts and troop and tank withdrawals, `` very little has changed. They've just put it in different places.'' Asked about the dramatic reforms attempted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he thinks the superpower is `` in flux, economically, socially, politically and security-wise.'' `` They do n't know what they're doin'. They've got a vision ... but they do n't know how to engineer it. They're feeling their way as they go,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. This has led to frustrations and uncertainty, including doubts about how long <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his supporters can continue to `` be solidly entrenched in power'' when his goals are not achieved. `` My instincts tell me ... that we exaggerate this problem,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said, adding that he also believes Americans `` exaggerate their power.'' He hastened to add, however, that this is a `` characteristic of all militaries _ you exaggerate the other fellow's -LRB- power -RRB- and underestimate your own.'' While <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> was the object of some criticism earlier this year for saying that he does not view the Soviets as an enemy, the chairman said he stands by that statement. But he emphasized that he continues to view the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a `` potential adversary.'' The admiral said he likes to quote a general who says <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should n't teach its military to have an enemy, but to know `` what's worth livin' for, what's worth dyin' for, what's worth fightin' for in this country. `` If we ca n't perform a function unless we have an enemy and somebody to hate, then we're in pretty bad shape,'' the admiral said.

<HEAD>Government Not Reimbursed for Private Use of Blair House, Report
Says</HEAD>

 Private groups hosted events last year at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> without paying the government for use of the presidential guest house, according to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report critical of the facility's management. The report, prepared by the department's inspector general late last year, also says a number of <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employees had not undergone security background investigations `` notwithstanding the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government's most important guests are lodged in it and sensitive meetings take place there.'' A copy of the report, which was released in January, was obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> under the Freedom of Information Act. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION>, said many recommendations in the 12-page report have been put into place Security checks, for instance, were finished before the final draft of the report was released, she said. Those without clearances included the curator's assistant, three management personnel and 49 contract employees who worked only during official visits, the report said. Additionally, some contract maintenance employees who were supposed to have an escort in Blair House `` were seen walking unescorted in the building,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which consists of four connected town houses on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> across from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, traditionally has been managed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under the chief of protocol. An associate department curator, who is in charge of arts and antiques at the historic, 115-room house, also works there. Blair House was closed for restoration between 1982 and mid-1988. The first foreign visitor to stay in the refurbished house came in September 1988. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quainton </PERSON>, the deputy inspector general who wrote the report, said several `` non-official groups, some of which included donors to the restoration project, have hosted events at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.'' The chief of protocol approved the events under the proper guidelines, but the groups were not charged for use of the building because of a loophole created by the department's legal adviser. <PERSON> Quainton </PERSON> recommended establishing firm procedures for `` reservations, billing and payment by private sources.'' <PERSON> Selwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, chief of protocol in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said that when the house was reopened the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Restoration Fund, the private charitable organization established to channel gifts to <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was allowed to host a series of events to `` give everyone who participated a chance to see this wonderful project.'' Other than groups arranged by the fund, no private organizations were allowed to use the house. The fund raised about $ 5 million for the $ 13 million Blair House restoration. Some $ 4 million of the privately raised money paid for furniture, draperies, carpets and upholstery. <PERSON> Quainton </PERSON> suggested a number of changes to ensure the `` hotel-cum-museum'' be maintained properly and operate smoothly in 1989, when as many as 30 official visits from foreign dignitaries were expected, and beyond. <PERSON> Quainton </PERSON> reported that: _ Extreme tension arose between the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> managers, who sought to run a `` first-class hotel,'' and the department's associate curator who emphasized the `` museum nature'' of the `` Housekeeping decisions _ down to questions of dusting and silver polishing techniques _ have become contentious,'' the report said. <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Conger </PERSON>, the department's curator, said the problems stemmed from personality conflicts between <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> managers and the former associate curator, who has resigned. _ <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` leanly staffed'' at periods of full activity `` At such times, management will be running an exclusive 30-bed hotel,'' catering state dinners and luncheons and providing routine meals, valet and personal services to high-ranking delegations. Between guests, the house is used by top government officials, usually for official functions. _ Procurement `` procedures were haphazard at best,'' the report said A `` relatively inexperienced and untrained junior employee with no background in financial management'' handled most government expenditures. Private money raised to support <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> was co-mingled with government funds, and one account had been reduced to $ 5. The report recommended appointment of a financial manager, consolidation of budget accounts and an increase in the amount of money allocated to <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to ensure it is properly maintained.

 This city has lost one of its most effective soldiers in the war on drugs, and it hardly noticed. A drug trafficker's bullet that pierced the throat of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazo </PERSON> in July ended the 13-year career of one of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s most productive undercover informants, drug enforcement officials said this week. <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON>, a 44-year-old Cuban immigrant who never had a formal education, began undercover operations that resulted in hundreds of arrests and removed at least a ton of cocaine from the streets, officials said. `` No one worked like <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarron </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent who worked with <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> daily for the past five years. <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> died without fanfare, but his life offered an unusual glimpse into the methods of drug enforcement. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents said the risky activities of people like <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> are the only way to penetrate smugglers' shadowy networks. `` He was an inspiration to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. `` He knew the danger was there but he still came through with all this information, day after day, year after year.'' The agency agreed to rare interviews on the subject because officials considered <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> a cut above other informants. `` Quite often the people who assist us in narcotics cases are not pillars of the community,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, describing <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> as an exception. `` He was just a concerned citizen.'' A short, balding man who walked with a limp after being stricken with polio as an infant, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> had to wear a weightlifting belt to support his bad back and considerable paunch. Born in poverty and unable to read or write, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> eventually would make more than $ 50,000 a year supplying information. His undercover career began in 1976, when he was hired to lay tile in the home of a major marijuana trafficker and saw piles of cash and a room-size safe being installed under the garage. `` He came to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and offered his services,'' said Coral Gables Lt. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkin </PERSON>. `` We gave him $ 500.'' After police seized 23 tons of pot and sent the trafficker to prison, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> found regular work with Miami-area police and federal agents. According to court records, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> did n't always operate on the right side of the law. In 1967, when he was struggling to find construction work to pay his rent, he was charged in a dozen burglaries. Orelle pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and spent a year in a mental hospital. In 1979, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> and another informant were caught impersonating police officers and offering to fix the case of an accused drug trafficker for $ 7,000. <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a lesser theft charge and was paroled. State prosecutors told police they no longer considered him a trustworthy informant, effectively blackballing him from <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courts. But, `` because of his value we began working with him again,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s Sarron. During the past five years, the period for which records were available, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> initiated about 50 cases, leading to 150 arrests. Thanks to his efforts, agents seized about $ 2 million in cash, $ 3 million in property, tons of marijuana, more than 1,000 kilos of cocaine and a quarter-million illegal sedatives. But <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON>'s identity became more known among dealers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Latin community each time he testified in court `` It always amazed a lot of us that he stayed alive so long,'' said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, a public defender who first met Orelle in 1977, when <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> was a prosecutor. It all caught up with him July 14. Working with <PERSON> Sarron </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> posed as a dealer wanting to buy 20 kilos of cocaine from <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, an accused smuggler. Before they could discuss prices, <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> and a gunman, <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, fired a spray of bullets, authorities said. A slug matching <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>' gun hit <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> in the throat, said prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornely </PERSON>. <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> bled to death. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> and his alleged getaway driver have been jailed and face first-degree murder and cocaine-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON>, the informant's 43-year-old widow, says her three teen-age children remain fiercely proud of their father. Her 16-year-old son wants to be a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent when he grows up. `` I'm trying to get his mind off it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Orelle </PERSON> said. `` I tell him ` I'm going to live the rest of my life in fear, and your wife and kids will be the same. You can do something about drugs in other ways.'''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Education Summit an Opportunity for Political Posturing</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lines already are drawn and they do n't give beleaguered parents a lot of hope that the education summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors will produce more than the familiar political posturing over the need to improve schools Well in advance of Wednesday's opening of the two-day summit, the White House was emphasizing the need for `` leadership'' and `` new ideas.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and many of his counterparts were responding, `` Send money.'' The likelihood is that it will take a lot of both to upgrade schools. Most Americans agree that education is too important to be left to educators. Now the <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, summit will focus attention on whether politicians are up to the task. The most optimistic prospect is that the president, his cabinet and the governors will sit down and have a serious exchange of ideas. As the officials at the table who are the closest to the problem, the governors can give the president plenty of examples of what works and what does n't. They have experience finding the improvements that can be made within the context of strained budgets. The White House also is emphasizing the fact this is only the third time in history a president has convened a summit with the nation's governors. The first took place in 1908 when <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> summoned the governors to discuss ways to preserve natural resources. Twenty-five years later, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> convened a summit to discuss ways to deal with the Depression. By stressing the historic significance of the meeting, White House aides and governors hope the meeting will mobilize public support for strong action to improve schools. `` Most Americans still believe that when we talk about a crisis in education, we are talking about someone else's kid in some other school,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a Republican who has been in the forefront of educational reform. `` If the presidential summit can turn that attitude around and highlight the need for a national focus on education, that will be a major achievement,'' said <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. It may take more than a two-day summit to change that attitude at a time when the issue of drugs dwarfs all other concerns. `` Drugs are so dominant in terms of the agenda, I'm not sure any of the other things pop up,'' said pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` I'm not sure the public is going to pay attention.'' While skeptical of the prospects that the summit can grab a share of public attention from drugs, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said it's as good a way as any to try. `` It certainly makes the issue a lot more important,'' he said. But if the elements are present for a successful meeting, so too are they present for a session dominated by politicking. The president finds it hard to resist his `` read my lips'' rhetoric on spending and taxes, drawing lines that do n't necessarily permit consideration of a proposal's merits Arguing with congressional Democrats over differing proposals to combat drug abuse, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> last week, `` There's a certain frustration level when we come out with a sound program and two answers come out: spend more and raise taxes.'' The Democrats often leave the impression they are obsessed with a need to define themselves and their role in dealing with national problems. Not invited to the economic summit were the Democrats who control <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They responded by announcing six `` National Goals for Educational Excellence.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to be known as the `` education president,'' but Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said, `` We intend to do all we can to see that this Congress matches him by becoming the ` education <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.' The structure of the summit was designed by the White House and is geared to assure that the president is the dominant figure. The only formal sessions open for press coverage will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speeches. It's a format that has governors uneasy and looking for ways to make their views known. The result could be a circus atmosphere as governors mingle with the press corps and invite questions. No one is predicting the summit will produce any quick answers or even an agenda for progress in education. What all sides appear to want is a meeting that will energize federal and state officials to work together in the future with an awareness that their bosses are committed to accomplishing something.

 When they put up a 300-ton Egyptian obelisk in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square more than 400 years ago, it was such a delicate operation that Pope <PERSON> Sixtus </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> pronounced a sentence of death in advance against anyone who let out a peep as it was pulled from the ground. The normally noisy Roman crowd was silent as the winches creaked and 140 horses panted. Then things began to slip and the whole project was in danger, including the 2,800-year-old obelisk. The voice of an Italian sailor broke the silence. `` Throw water on the ropes!'' he yelled. They did. Ropes tightened around the capstans and the obelisk began to rise again. It is still there. Not only was the obelisk saved and the sailor reprieved, but his village got the exclusive right to sell palm fronds in the square on Palm Sunday. That was the story told by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, professor of art history at <ORGANIZATION> Wellesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, who helped select work for the show called `` Italian Etchers of the Renaissance and Baroque.'' It opened Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> to begin the fall season. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said he believed the village still enjoys its privilege. One of the etchings, <PERSON> Natale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON>'s `` Moving the Vatican Obelisk,'' does not exactly prove the story but it does show the huge engineering job in tiny detail. Horses strain, workmen help. There were 800 of them and one seated on the tip of the obelisk guides the most important rope. The exhibit has 135 etchings made between 1520 and 1700. Some of the etchers were also famous painters like <ORGANIZATION> Michelangelo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravaggio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorrain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luca </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, <PERSON> Annibale </PERSON> <PERSON> Caracci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>. Others are little known, even to specialists. <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> is not believed to have done any paintings. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> explained to reporters that etching was one of the first ways of making art available in many copies _ 20 to 50 from each copper plate. It was also a handy way for poor artists to make money. Many of the plates are still in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in the storehouse called the <LOCATION> Calcografia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said that until the 1970s, employees there, for a small fee, would print a fresh but greatly inferior copy from selected plates. He added that for an even smaller fee they would leave off the stamp certifying it as a late copy, so an unscrupulous purchaser could sell it to an inexperienced collector as an original. Then a new director stopped the practice. Before etching became popular some artists made engravings by cutting a metal plate with a metal tool. But an etcher could just draw with a needle on a soft covering like paint, called a `` ground,'' which was spread over the plate. Then he or she would let acid eat into the metal through the lines that the needle had drawn. The grooves could then hold ink for printing. `` I've done both, `` <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` Etching is easier than pen-and-ink drawing, especially with a quill pen. Engraving is like plowing. Etching is like ice skating.''

<HEAD>People Flock To Pagodas To Pray For Dead, Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>

 The jacaranda petals went limp with water. A <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk gave the yellow flower a quick shake and the prayer service began. Chants filled the vault of ashes. Hands clasped in front of him, <PERSON> Pun </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaly </PERSON> bowed three times for the soul of his mother. A <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla attack killed her in July while she was on a trip to her native village. <PERSON> Samaly </PERSON>, joined by brothers, sisters, neighbors, his wife and daughter, gathered over the weekend in a riverside pagoda to commemorate her death. `` I only hope the death like the one suffered by my mother can stop in this country,'' <PERSON> Samaly </PERSON> said, speaking in French, as he sat on a straw mat, facing a small silver urn that held his mother's ashes `` But all we little people can really do is pray.'' In <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the last two weeks in September are called the <LOCATION> Phumben </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> holiday to remember the dead. Throughout this predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> nation of 8 million, families flock to pagodas to burn joss sticks, bow, chant and sit for the souls of their ancestors. `` But many too are praying not just for the past but also for the future,'' said <PERSON> Kah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramh </PERSON>, an elderly monk at the pagoda. `` This is an important time we are facing now.'' This year the festival for the dead coincides with the announced withdrawal of the last 26,000 of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s soldiers from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded its neighbor almost 11 years ago, ousting the ultra-radical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government and replacing it with a pro-Hanoi regime. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it lost 55,000 soldiers in their battles with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> says it lost 20,000. Now, with the Vietnamese saying their last soldier will be out by Tuesday, many Cambodians are worried that their country will again slide into civil war. Already there are reports of fierce fighting on the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, and the government is acknowledging that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> forces hold some territory. On Sunday, when the Samaly's prayed, the pagoda was packed. Today, it was deserted as hundreds of troop trucks carrying Vietnamese soldiers rumbled by. `` We must always remember the old woman <PERSON> Samaly </PERSON>,'' said one of her neighbors during the prayers. `` Any of us could have died like her. We must never forget.'' An elderly nun, sitting among the Samaly clan, lit some incense and a sweet smell hung low in the air, cool and wet in the underground darkness. The vault of ashes used to be filled with the urns of hundreds of Cambodians but during the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule from 1975 to 1978 it, like all the other pagodas in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, was cleared out and used as a warehouse. Now, the small wood and glass cases are slowly being graced again with the mementos of the dead _ a photograph and a candle, a lithograph and a flower. During the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, all monks were defrocked and thousands were killed. When the pro-Vietnamese government was installed, it brought Buddhism back but persecution continued. Pagodas were taxed by the state and only men over 55 could become monks. Only in the past year has the government allowed its people to actively return to the practice of Buddhism. Since mid-1988, state-run radio has been broadcasting Buddhist prayers. State leaders, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, have appeared at <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> ceremonies and the age restriction on entering the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> clergy has been lowered to 10. Still, the government appears firmly committed to keeping Buddhism a state-run religion. Its aim is to prevent a return of the 1950s when pagodas and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> schools served as the well-spring of progressive and revolutionary political thought. `` The state and religion are not separated,'' <PERSON> Tep </PERSON> <PERSON> Vong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s top <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted recently as saying. Another factor working against a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> resurgence is an apparent lack of interest in religion among <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s youth. Youthful giggles broke out during the Samaly clan's prayers. None of the children knew the chants and the three teen-agers present refused to follow along. Tea Somaly, grandson of the deceased, said his father, <PERSON> Pun </PERSON>, had forced him to come. `` On Sunday, I usually go to the video parlor to see a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> movie,'' said the 15-year-old. `` I like the action and <LOCATION> Kung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fu </LOCATION>.'' He said he also was worried about the future of his country but did n't think prayers would help. `` What can that do?'' he asked. `` It just wastes time.'' Outside, on the pagoda grounds, hundreds of Cambodians knelt in prayer to pay tribute to the dead. Jacaranda petals scattered in the wind. `` We put these in the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guns when they came into the city in 1975,'' said an old monk holding a flower. `` These people are praying we do n't have to do that again.''

<HEAD>One Billion People Ill or Hungry, World Health Organization Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Developed countries have the tools to end the `` preventable tragedy'' of disease and malnutrition that afflicts 1 billion people worldwide, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> says. The 1 billion figure means one of every five humans suffers from disease or malnutrition, <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> director-general Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> said Sunday, adding that the greatest burden of disease is in poor countries of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` This is a preventable tragedy because the developed world has the resources and technology to end common diseases worldwide,'' he said in a statement accompanying a WHO report. `` The missing ingredient is the will to help the developing countries. `` The rich countries must transfer technology, health manpower and money, because the poorest countries ca n't help themselves,'' <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> said. He said health expenditures in the poorest countries average about $ 5 per person, while in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, health expenditures average about $ 400 a person. Despite the gloomy picture, <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> said health care has improved enough n the last 40 years to raise human life expectancy from 41 to 59.7 years in the developing countries. Accomplishments in recent decades include the eradication of smallpox and new measures to control river blindness, a major cause of blindness in tropical regions. The last case of smallpox was reported in 1979. Eradicating the disease has saved an estimated 20 million lives worldwide, the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> said. Aerial spraying for blackflies, which carry river blindness, has protected about 4 million children from the disease, the WHO estimates. A new drug is being distributed now to treat those already infected. And by the year 2000, the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> predicts the eradication of polio, a disease now striking about 208,000 children annually. Almost all the victims are in developing countries.

 A minister of an affluent church prayed for speedy damage settlements, and less fortunate victims of Hurricane Hugo lined up in drizzling rain for free barbecue and milk to feed their babies. `` If you do n't have money, you're in trouble,'' <PERSON> Carlotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said after visiting a food van parked at the <ORGANIZATION> Citadel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't get the money out of the bank because the electricity is off.'' The van, operated by volunteers from the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Baptist State Convention, fed an estimated 2,000 people Sunday. It is one of 30 such vans. `` It tells me there's a lot of hungry people and that's what we're here for,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Emmette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` A lot of them will go through the line a dozen times but that's beside the point because they're hungry. Nearby, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, rector of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, asked for divine help in processing insurance claims of his well-to-do congregation `` We pray, Lord, that all who have lost something may begin the process of recovery,'' he said. `` We pray specifically for insurance agents that they may be motivated by a sense of fairness and urgency.'' With a city-wide power outage expected to last weeks, many residents ca n't cook. Water service has been restored, but residents were told to boil it before drinking. There has been no mail since the storm, delaying some paychecks. But even if the checks had arrived, no banks were open to cash them. Amid the debris hurled about by the storm's 135 mph winds, needy people lined up in a parking lot Sunday for barbecue chicken, sweet corn, butter beans and a slice of bread. Volunteers also handed out milk and bottled water. A few blocks away, more affluent victims sipped beer and munched on chicken salad sandwiches at <ORGANIZATION> Aaron </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deli </ORGANIZATION>, one of the few downtown restaurants to reopen. `` My husband and I are so fortunate,'' said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, wife of the owner. `` My studio upstairs was untouched. My sculptures _ nothing _ was damaged.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> said she was impressed with the community spirit in some neighborhoods where homeowners have joined together in clearing roads with chainsaws and assisting in other cleanup efforts. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> predicted people who had steaks and seafood in their freezers will eat well for a few days. But the food will spoil without refrigeration. The outage is expected to last several weeks. `` What happens in two weeks?'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> asked. `` They'll have eaten it or thrown it away.'' <PERSON> Renildo </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, one of the needy people who accepted a free meal at the disaster van, said he had no food. `` I eat where I can get a meal,'' said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 26. `` My neighborhood looks like a trash barrel. Everything is out _ trees, light poles and cars overturned.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> visited the van with her husband, <PERSON> Gussie </PERSON>, and 9-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Presha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a shipyard worker, said the family has no meat and no electricity for cooking. His roof was damaged, but <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said he has covered the exposed area with plastic. Elsewhere, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, co-owner of an outdoor catering company, fed needy people barbecue, hotdogs and rice from a portable grill hooked up to his pickup truck. `` We're just trying to provide a hot meal,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` Hey, the people need it. There are people -LRB- who -RRB- have not eaten for three days. If they can find us, then we're all better off.'' <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> waited for hotdogs with two of his five children. He said the storm damaged his roof and blew out his windows. `` We're all sleeping in one room because the roof leaks,'' he said. `` Ai n't no money coming through. I have to scramble for my family _ make sure they get something to eat.'' A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurant near City Hall opened two days after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> ripped through the city. Customers often discuss their storm experiences while sipping red wine or imported beer in a cozy setting. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiss </PERSON>, between sips of wine, said his home and business were not damaged by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds, but about a dozen trees were toppled in his yard. He and his wife, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>, rode out the storm in their downtown jewelry store. Since then, they have stayed in an apartment above the store to protect it from looters. `` We just want to be on the safe side,'' he said. `` We stocked up and had plenty of food. Everybody is inconvenienced a little bit, but considering the scope of the disaster, we're in pretty good shape.''

 Thousands of rural communities would lose their only source of public transportation if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decides the Dallas-based transit company must equip every bus with a wheelchair lift, says <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Advocates for the handicapped, however, say Greyhound is exaggerating the costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act to shift attention away from the real issue _ that the handicapped are largely denied access to public transportation. Under the Senate-approved legislation, Greyhound, the only national intercity bus company, would have six years from enactment to make its buses accessible to the handicapped, including those in wheelchairs. Greyhound interprets that as a mandate for a lift in every bus, although the legislation is not that specific. Hearings are under way in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a version of the bill, which could pass before the end of the year. Greyhound estimates the minimal annual costs of compliance at $ 30 million to $ 40 million _ a `` bullet to the heart'' of a company that lost $ 17 million last year and expects to make $ 5 million to $ 10 million this year, says <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Currey </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer.

 Incarcerations for convicted drug offenders more than doubled in five states between 1983 and 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The 104 percent increase in prison or jail sentences caused the overall number of incarcerations to increase 28 percent, said a study released Sunday.

The proportion of convicted defendants imprisoned or jailed increased for each category of offense: violent crimes, property crimes, drug crimes and public-order crimes. According to the report, 62 percent of the 1.9 million people arrested during that period were convicted. Thirty-nine percent of the people arrested went on to jail or prison. Of those convicted, 67 percent went on to state or local jails, 15 percent were fined, and 18 percent received probation. An arrest was not recorded for purposes of the study until the case was disposed of with either a verdict or a decision not to prosecute. Arrests for drug offenses increased 52 percent, prosecutions rose 61 percent and convictions for those crimes went up 71 percent during the four-year period, said the report from the bureau's Offender Based Transaction Statistics Program

 The case of a psychologist charged with helping to hide a 5-year-old from a mother who allegedly neglected the boy is raising ethical questions for professionals who treat abused children, experts say. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who has testified in prominent child custody cases across the nation, was charged Sept. 18 with three counts of conspiracy to harbor or hide <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Meriweather </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> has been missing since a July 1987 visit to his father in <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. Authorities believe he's being held by his father somewhere. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, the boy's grandfather, and a physician who has examined him, claim the father was justified in vanishing with <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> because he was virtually starved while in the care of his mother. Some child abuse specialists say they are troubled by the government's seizing of evidence _ handwritten notes and a telephone bill for a call to <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> _ from <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s office and home. The records seizure and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s arrest could have a `` chilling effect'' on medical professionals who treat abused children, said Dr. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and an assistant professor of pediatrics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` To have confidential knowledge about a client seized by the state threatens the entire therapeutic enterprise,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, an associate professor of social work at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> called his arrest an `` outrage.'' `` This sends an ominous message to health professionals who try to help troubled kids from broken homes that they are standing on shaky, shaky legal ground,'' said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who is free on his recognizance and faces trial Feb. 7. But <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mary </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, said she has evidence that <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> at least twice knowing that state and federal warrants had been issued for the boy and his father. `` This is a situation where somebody who does n't like the outcome of the court order just takes the law into their own hands and does whatever he wants. It makes the very foundation of our legal system ineffective,'' she said. The boy's grandfather, <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meriweather </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hinton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> had grown increasingly thin while living with his mother, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadway </PERSON>, 27. `` The baby had a bloated belly like those starving babies you see on television in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and his hair was just falling out of his head when it was brushed,'' he said. <PERSON> Treadway </PERSON> won custody when she divorced her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Meriweather </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in 1985. She moved to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and agreed to let <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> spend a week each month with his father. `` We've done just about everything we can do to find him and I'm all torn up inside,'' she said in an interview Dr. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> pediatrician who examined <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> in 1986 and 1987, said he appeared to be underweight. `` He would systematically lose up to a half a pound every time he visited his mother, and gain it back when he was with his dad. Calories at that age are crucial to brain development, and kids just ca n't afford to have their weight bounce back and forth like that,'' she said. <PERSON> Treadway </PERSON> said <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> was perfectly healthy in her care. `` Kids are kids and some of them do n't have the figures that adults might expect them to have,'' she said. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 43, has testified on behalf of Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, plastic surgeon who has been in jail for hiding her 7-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, from the courts since 1987. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has alleged that the child's father, Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, sexually abused the child, a claim <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> denies.

Instead, wholesale prices have declined since Sept. 1. `` It's terribly disappointing and does not bode well for the industry,'' said grower <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. According to the government's <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the top grade of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delicious </ORGANIZATION> apples was selling for $ 12 to $ 14 per 42-pound box on Sept. 18, down from around $ 20 per box in early September. Last year, the same grade sold for $ 26 to $ 28 per box. `` We have yet to get our crop off the trees and the price is beaten down to a price level equivalent to the worst times of Alar,'' complained grower <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> of <PERSON> Selah </PERSON>. He referred to widespread consumer concern over growers' use of the chemical Alar after a private health group publicized studies linking Alar byproducts with cancer. Some think rising supply is the reason for the low wholesale prices. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is sending a record number of apples to supermarkets this year, boosting the size of the national apple crop by 7 percent over last year. Because most apples are bought on long-term contracts, wholesale price changes take time to show up in markets. `` We would expect lower consumer prices than last year,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a fresh produce trade group based in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, Del. The industry is trying to bury the Alar issue, and little, if any, of the chemical was used on the 1989 crop. <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> removed the chemical from the market earlier this year as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> moved to examine the issue. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state instituted a program requiring farmers to apply for special permits to use Alar, a growth regulator. None did, and an extensive state testing program so far has found Alar only in traces that indicate carry-over from previous years' spraying. The industry was heartened by record consumer demand for apples all summer, and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has said its polling shows Alar is not a major issue. `` There is a lot of reason for optimism,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, commission spokesman. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> normally produces about half the nation's supermarket apples, but weather problems in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> should boost the state's share this season. Apples are a big business in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where 4,500 growers produce a crop worth $ 800 million per year. That does n't include hundreds of millions of dollars in additional sales by apple juice and apple sauce makers based in the state. The national crop forecast calls for 230 million boxes, 7 percent above last year, with 132 million boxes destined for supermarkets and the rest for processors. Of that, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will produce about 107 million boxes, of which a record 75 million are for supermarkets. They will be purchased by consumers who eat an average of 20 pounds of apples per year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> are the second-largest apple producers, each with 7 percent of the crop. Many <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers are counting on the 1989 crop to save them after two consecutive years of poor crops. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a grower from <PERSON> Wapato </PERSON>, said he lost $ 500,000 in 1987, a crop that was damaged by weather, and $ 200,000 last year. It costs growers about $ 9.50 to grow, pick, pack and ship a box of apples. `` If we have another 1987-1988, an awful large percentage of us have to fold up and walk away,'' <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said.

 Military and civilian cargo planes loaded with relief supplies arrived in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> as a delegation from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> surveyed damage a week after Hurricane Hugo devastated the island. Food kits, small tractors and medical supplies were unloaded Sunday at the wrecked airport by military police, who arrived on the island Thursday to restore order after three days of looting. `` What we need here is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. We'd be happy with anything we can get,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who, with his wife and two children was camping in his roofless, debris-littered home. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he was recovering zinc sheeting and debris in the street to rebuild his house. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport that brought <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and seven congressmen carried a shipment of chainsaws, which soldiers unloaded onto an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> truck while <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters buzzed overhead. `` Everybody's pouring in stuff like it's the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> airlift,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLugo </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>' non-voting representative to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON>, who accompanied the delegation on a quick tour of <LOCATION> St </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, estimated damage at $ 500 million. <PERSON> DeLugo </PERSON> said it could run as high as $ 1 billion. Hurricane Hugo seriously damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the island's homes. The storm knocked out all phone, power and water services and was followed by widespread looting that cleaned out most stores not protected by armed guards. Officials say the storm caused at least 27 deaths and billions of dollars in damage as it surged over several islands from <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> last week before hitting the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. The 1,341 troops sent to help <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> police prevent looting and restore order arrived days after most businesses on St. Croix were already looted. Relief supplies arriving at the airport were loaded onto trucks and sent to distribution points around the island, though by Sunday it appeared they were not yet being distributed to the public. A DC-7 from a clothing company unloaded a shipment of boxed food. On Saturday, an oil company flew in 75,000 individual meals for the island's 55,000 people. Radio stations announced where to find water, gasoline and medical attention. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said he expected water to be running by today. Dozens of people, some with broken limbs, others waiting for routine treatment, crowded into a clinic near <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION>, where doctors said they lacked everything: water, medicine, sheets and food. `` All the doctors are doing a little bit of everything, working outside of their specialization,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, a radiologist. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was setting up a mobile surgical hospital outside <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION>. Mail service was re-established to the island Saturday, said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, postal inspector in charge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> possessions in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Before visiting <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> delegation surveyed hurricane damage in neighboring <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> Saturday. They returned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capital Sunday afternoon.

<HEAD>Ortega Predicts Sandinista Election Victory, Defeat For The United

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nominated by acclamation to run for re-election, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> predicted that he would win in another defeat for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, supplier of the Contra rebels who fought his leftist government. `` We will win,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a cheering convention of the ruling leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that nominated him and running mate <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> on Sunday night. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, 44, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to power with the 1979 overthrow of dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, had been expected to win the nomination. A Sandinista electoral victory next year, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in an acceptance speech, will be `` one more defeat the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to have to accept. They will have to reach an understanding with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> after the defeat they are going to suffer. They have no other choice.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been helping the Contras _ short for counterrevolutionaries _ since 1981. For the past year, such assistance has been limited to non-lethal aid, greatly reducing their effectiveness as a fighting force. Except for a brief visit to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> by a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official two weeks ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused any high level contact with the Sandinistas to discuss pending issues since it broke off talks five years ago. At a meeting last month, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> formally agreed to disband the Contras by Dec. 8 as part of an overall plan to end conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In exchange, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> moved national elections originally scheduled for 1991 to Feb. 25 and promised that opposition candidates will be allowed to campaign free of harassment, with a free press _ and that the balloting will be honest. Both the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and rebel leaders, however, say they want to maintain the Contra force intact until after the election to make sure the Sandinistas keep their promise. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s challenger will be <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper. She is being fielded by a 14-party coalition, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been considering how to aid. The convention, representing a wide spectrum of society, also chose 90 candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> _ the single-chamber legislature _ and mayors for the nation's 145 cities and towns. An economic boycott, together with the Contra war and government mismanagement have completely stagnated <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economy, now one of the poorest in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bodies Arrive In Paris; Probe Focuses On Bomb In Front Cargo Hold</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bodies of victims from the bombing of a French DC-10 over <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> have arrived in the French capital, and investigators said the bomb was likely planted in the jet's forward cargo hold. `` Very probable traces of an explosion were in fact concentrated in one of the cargo compartments, situated at the front of the plane,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paillasse </PERSON>, head of an investigative commission from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. `` It is certain that there was an explosive substance,'' he said Sunday in an interview with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> radio RTL from <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>. All 171 people aboard <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 772 were killed when it exploded 30,000 feet over south-central <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The flight was en route from the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after a stopover in <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. About 40 bodies arrived at Le Bourget airport Sunday aboard a DC-8 cargo plane and were taken immediately to the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> morgue for identification and autopsy, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Autopsies should indicate whether the passengers and crew inhaled gases that would provide clues about what explosive blew the plane apart less than an hour after its takeoff from <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paillase </PERSON> also said laboratory tests had begun on debris shipped to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> `` to determine, on the basis of the traces of combustion, which explosive material was involved.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that evidence from the crash site and analysis of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders left no doubt that an explosion caused the disaster. Authorities have been unwilling to speculate about who might have placed a bomb aboard the flight, but appear to be treating with great skepticism the claims of responsibility issued so far. A previously unknown group calling itself the Secret Chadian Resistance sent statements to Western news agencies in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday claiming to have bombed the flight as part of a struggle for `` the complete withdrawal of all military colonial forces from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> maintains about 1,600 soldiers in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, deployed to help the former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> colony in its long war with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have promised to end their dispute peacefully, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has continued to call for withdrawal of all <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> troops from the country. Calls to UTA several hours after the plane was bombed and to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the following day claimed responsibility on behalf of <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>. Islamic Jihad is one of the names used by Shiite Moslem extremists believed holding several Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But that group customarily makes its statements in writing, accompanied by photographs of its hostages to prove their authenticity. French news reports have underscored the similarity between the UTA crash and the December bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bombing, one prominent theory is that the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a Palestinian splinter group, placed a sophisticated bomb in a radio-cassette player checked as baggage in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, designed to explode following a stopover in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The French news accounts have speculated that a similar bomb could have been placed in the baggage compartment of the <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, designed to explode only after the plane stopped in <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION> and took off again.

 The dollar, pushed by the Japanese and American central banks, plunged more than two yen against the Japanese yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index climbed to its highest level in a month. The dollar's decline followed a weekend meeting at which the monetary authorities of seven major industrial nations agreed to act to check the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's recent rise. The dollar closed at 142.95 yen, down 2.05 yen from Friday's close of 145.00 yen It opened at 144.47 yen and ranged between 142.20 yen and 144.50 yen. The dollar's close was its lowest since 142.35 yen on Aug. 23. Currency dealers said both the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had been heavily selling dollars. `` It seems that the -LRB- joint intervention -RRB- shows that monetary authorities are carrying out what they said in the statements'' issued at the weekend meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said a source close to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> alone was estimated to have sold $ 1 billion in heavy trading that amounted to $ 13.319 billion, currency dealers said. The amount of intervention by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank was not immediately known. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> ordinarily does not comment on its activities in the exchange market. Finance ministers at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting said in a statement that the recent rise of the dollar `` could adversely affect prospects for the world economy,'' and agreed to cooperate in foreign exchange markets to curb the dollar's strength. The ministers were from the `` Group of Seven'' _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. On the stock market, the long-awaited strengthening of the yen encouraged investors to buy shares. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the exchange's main index, rose 188.92 points, or 0.54 percent, closing at 34,960.71. It was the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s highest close since 35,114.35 on Aug. 22. Securities dealers said shares were bought broadly in small lots. `` The market was waiting for an opportunity to turn bullish and it seems as though the dollar's sudden weakening became a very good one,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage, speaking on condition of anonymity. But some dealers said institutional investors have not yet fully joined in the buying despite the generally bullish market sentiment.

 Fire destroyed the only grocery store in this small <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farming community, forcing residents to travel 120 miles to buy food. `` As far as the city is concerned, it's the worst thing that could have burned,'' city secretary <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> said several hours after she watched flames devour the two-story <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. `` There's not one other place to buy a loaf of bread, a <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> or anything. It's a 124-mile round trip to <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> for the next nearest place.'' The store located at the base of the <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, about 90 minutes east of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, not only served the 350 residents of <LOCATION> Dell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 A huge welcome back ceremony for the crew that crash-landed a crippled <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 here two months ago left the pilot with a bittersweet feeling. Although 184 survived the July 19 crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232, 112 died. Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> has been hesitant to accept praise for his skillful landing of the plane, whose hydraulic system had been ruined by a midair mechanical failure. On Sunday, about 40,000 people jammed <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for an air show and ceremony to honor <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, his crew and those on the ground who helped survivors. `` It was a little mixed emotions for about five minutes as I wondered how I was going to react,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said after the event. `` It only lasted for a couple of minutes and then I knew I was going to be all right. ... `` We're kind of overwhelmed by it,'' he added. `` We did n't expect this kind of attention They are unbelievable. They are just great.'' Crew members <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Record </PERSON>, along with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> training pilot <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> also were on hand, with two of the men still wearing casts from the fiery crash. Along with <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> they have been credited with an extraordinary achievement in guiding the airliner to land after its No. 2 engine blew apart, severing hydraulic lines that controlled the aircraft's flight With no procedure for such a circumstance, the crew had to improvise a response. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said he spent much of the day touring hospitals to thank doctors and nurses. `` We got reacquainted with them and they could kind of see that their work did some good because people are back together,'' said <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> has been on medical leave since the crash, but said he hopes to return to the air Nov. 1. Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> presented the crew with citations and small plaques, and said <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials and workers were responsible for the swift and effective response. `` Your calm action saved lives and helped people cope with a dire emergency,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` You are a special group of people.''

 The marina that serves this resort island for all practical purposes does n't exist: It was blown 300 yards away by Hurricane Hugo. A pile of at least two dozen yachts and sailboats, some worth $ 200,000 or more, are crammed like sardines onto neighboring <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>, harbormaster at what's left of Wild Dunes Marina on the Isle of Palms, said Sunday he does n't know how things will get rebuilt. `` It's a mess,'' <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> said. `` We're going to try to figure out how to get those boats out of there. It's going to take a while.'' Throughout the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area, pleasure boats, yachts and fishing craft are scattered like toys kicked about by an angry child. Some marinas broke completely loose from their pilings under <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135 mph winds, sending docks and boats spinning in all directions. Isle of Palms remained under martial law Sunday, with rifle-toting National Guardsmen keeping homeowners and the curious away. The Coast Guard even resricted boat traffic in the Intracoastal Waterway that leads to the island, Some residents were being allowed back today, but just long enough to take stock of the damage. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> itself, a 45-foot sailboat sat Sunday in the middle of normally busy <LOCATION> Lockwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>. Several yachts lay across the road in the front yard of a condominium complex, while others were lodged under the <LOCATION> Ashley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot of people who lost thousands of dollars in boats,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> `` Shorty'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, manager of the <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marina </PERSON>. `` It's the worst I've ever seen.'' Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was searching for at least 30 missing boats _ but many more reports were expected as people gain access to docks. `` We do n't really know how many are missing and from where,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. North of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, along the <ORGANIZATION> Intracoastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterway </ORGANIZATION>, the fishing village of <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION>, population about 500, appeared devasted by the hurricane that swept ashore late Thursday. Phone service was cut off, and Mayor <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said community's shrimping industry was wiped out `` I do n't think anyone was prepared for this,'' said <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, who with her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, toured <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION> during the weekend. Their shrimp boat was washed ashore, along with several others. `` I do n't know how many can recover. A lot of people will be going back to work but not us,'' she said. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princess </ORGANIZATION>, a 75-foot tour boat, said dozens of boats and shrimp trawlers were lost in the <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` They're up in the trees, in the grass. Some of them are sunk.''

<HEAD>Lundberg: Slight Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gasoline prices rose nearly a third of a cent during the past two weeks, a survey found. The average national price of gasoline rose 0.31 cents, to $ 1.0943 a gallon for the week ended Sept. 22, according to the Lundberg Survey. A competitive end-of-summer market forced retailers to hold prices down even though wholesale prices were increasing, said <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, director of the biweekly survey of 12,000 stations. But during the past two weeks, the wholesale rises have been great enough to force retailers to increase pump prices, she said Sunday. She forecast the trend would continue into the fall, `` but its difficult to do during a time of decreased demand.'' Average nationwide prices per gallon at self-service pumps, which account for more than 80 percent of all sales, were: 98.25 cents for regular unleaded; $ 1.1531 for premium unleaded; and 97.22 cents for regular leaded. For full-service, the averages were $ 1.2721 for regular unleaded, $ 1.3967 for premium unleaded and $ 1.2619 for regular leaded.

<TEXT>
 A small earthquake jostled this coastal city and was followed by at least two lesser aftershocks, prompting worried calls to emergency agencies but no reports of injuries or property damage. The first quake registered 2.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale when it struck at 9:59 p.m. Sunday nine miles southeast of here, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, a spokesman for the seismology lab at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. An aftershock measuring 2.7 struck at 10:30 p.m. and one that registered 1.9 followed at 11:15 p.m., <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. Both aftershocks were centered in the same area as the first quake, he said. The Vetura County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received several calls from rattled residents. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage. A 7 reading is capable of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Syria Violates Cease-Fire As 1 Million Beirutis Return</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syrian artillery fired 80 shells into pine woods in the country's Christian enclave today, violating a 2-day-old Arab League cease-fire during which more than 1 million refugees returned to the capital. Police reported no casualties in the 45-minute barrage on the thinly populated area near the mountain resort town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meri </LOCATION>, 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Some of the shells exploded less than a mile from the hilltop Bustan Hotel where Arab League mediator <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> al-Ibrahimi was staying. The sudden barrage ended at 7:45 a.m., said a police spokesman who can not be named under standing regulations. Christian forces led by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not respond to the Syrian shellfire, the spokesman reported. There were no immediate reports of casualties. It was the first serious violation of the cease-fire since it took hold Saturday evening after six months of fighting between the Syrians and Christians that by police count has killed 929 people and wounded 2,741. There was no official explanation for the barrage on the forested mountain slopes, which appeared to have been deliberately targeted because few people live there. An informed Moslem source said it was `` a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> message to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> that the truce could fall apart if the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> media does not stop its campaign against the Syrians.'' <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, deputy Secretary-General of the 22-member Arab League, was scheduled to preside later today over a meeting of a security committee made up of officials of several Lebanese factions to assess efforts to consolidate the truce. It was called more than a week ago by the King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, who form an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee assigned to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They entered the country in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. But <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has charged they abrogated that mandate by openly siding with the Moslems. A member of the security committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it will also discuss ways of `` monitoring and blocking'' shipments of weapons and ammunition to the warring factions. The committee comprises representatives of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army command, the rival pro-Syrian Moslem army command of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> and the three principal militias in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the Shiite Moslem Amal and the <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> took the brunt of the savage shelling by both sides since March 8, forcing all but 150,000 of the capital's 1.5 million population to flee to safer areas. Moslem housewife <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Makkouk </PERSON> returned to her third-floor apartment in the <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haidar </LOCATION> district of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Sunday evening with her husband and two children. `` I was so happy to be back home, I just could n't sleep,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Makkouk </PERSON>. She and her family spent four months living with relatives and friends in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` All the windows have been blown out by the shelling. I spent the whole night cleaning the apartment. But I'm not tired,'' she said. As Beirutis began picking up the pieces of their shattered lives, the city's 11 daily newspapers published advertisements from schools announcing that they will resume classes early next month. Educational institutes in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> closed in March shortly after the fighting broke out.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who brought the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION> to television, fired <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> as host and dethroned <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> because of nude photos, has died at age 76. Marks, who directed the pageant for 35 years before his retirement in 1987, died Sunday of complications from a heart attack he suffered Sept. 11, a few days before this year's finals. Marks, and investment broker, worked tirelessly and without pay on the contest, at first to boost his city's image and then out of love of the pageant, said his successor, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. `` He not only helped make a major contribution to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but gave an opportunity for thousands of young women across the country to receive scholarship assistance,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. Though officially retired from the pageant, Marks offered advice this year. The day before his heart attack, he visited pageant staff and contestants and posed for photos with some of them, including Miss America 1971 <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a co-host of this year's show. Affable to most but acerbic to those he perceived a threat to the show, Marks tightly held the reigns in a sometimes bumpy road to the runway. `` He had a capacity for making quick decisions and never looking back,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, who knew Marks for 25 years. Marks joined the pageant as an unpaid volunteer in 1952. His job that year was to escort <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> to and from a float she rode in the contest's annual Boardwalk parade. ` She was n't able to get onto the float because of her tight dress,'' he recalled last year, `` so I had to give her a push by the derriere to get her up.'' Marks went on to serve as director for 35 years, the last 25 as chairman. Marks brought the show to television in 1954. He defended the pageant against criticism from the women's liberation movement, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, labor organizations and some who consider Miss America an outdated symbol In the late 1960s, he suggested scuttling the swimsuit competition for sports clothes. But he abandoned the proposal in the face of objections from state pageant committees. In January 1980, <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> decided against renewing Parks' contract. Marks said he sent a letter to Parks' home in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to notify him. But Parks was staying at his home in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for the holidays and did n't find out he was fired until until he was questioned an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter. Parks did n't immediately return a call Sunday, but his wife, <PERSON> Annette </PERSON>, said she and her husband `` felt a terrible loss'' with Marks' death. In 1982, Marks dropped the trademark `` There She Is'' song in a dispute with songwriter <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. He allowed the song's return in 1985. The biggest scandal was in 1984, when a magazine published nude photographs of <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the first black to win the rhinestone-studded crown, also became the first to be forced into giving it up. Miss <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> 1984, <PERSON> Suzette </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, served the rest of Miss <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' reign <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 1959 and wife of Parks' successor, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, remembered Marks this way: `` He weathered all the controversy that came up and the Miss America Pageant got stronger,'' she said. `` That's the mark of the man.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The military government announced it will transfer power to a civilian president in 1990 elections, the first vote since balloting last year that was widely regarded as fraudulent. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> will also hold local and legislative elections, the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said in a communique read Sunday over state radio. `` All dispositions have been taken to guarantee security and ensure a peaceful transition of power,'' the communique said. On Jan. 17, 1988, civilian <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was elected in balloting thought to have been rigged by the army. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was ousted in a military coup five months later. The presidential elections will be held in two rounds on Oct. 17 and Nov. 11, 1990, the government said. The first round will be among a field of about 10 candidates, and the second will be a runoff among the top vote-getters, the communique said. It did not say how many candidates would be allowed into the second round, nor did it say whether international observers would be allowed to monitor the balloting. On Nov. 29, 1987, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> tried to hold the first free general elections since the country gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1804, but 34 voters were shot and hacked to death at the polls by thugs in collusion with the army.

 A block party organized by neighbors fed up with drug dealers ended in a gun battle between gang members and soldiers from a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, some of whom were called in as reinforcements. No one was hurt in the fight Saturday night, although it lasted 30 minutes and involved about 20 shooters. About 300 rounds of ammunition were fired, smashing windows and damaging parked cars, police and witnesses said Sunday. Police arrested two alleged gang members on previous warrants and confiscated several weapons from the soldiers. The party was given by Army Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, to rally residents who have been trying to rid the <LOCATION> Hilltop </LOCATION> district neighborhood of crack dealers, authorities said. Some of the soldiers from <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>'s battalion were invited to the party as guests and bodyguards, base spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> called in reinforcements after alleged gang members attacked the party with shotguns and handguns, witnesses and police said. Ten soldiers were involved in the shootout, <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said up to 15 <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> may have been involved. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said 40 to 55 people were at the party when six to 10 gang members surrounded <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>'s house and began firing. Gang members `` were throwing things at the house, they started threatening the people over here with burning the house down and, ` We're going to fire up after dark' and this kind of thing,'' <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> said. `` That's when I decided to call back to the battalion and get a hold of any available Ranger that I could and ask him to come out and provide reinforcements,'' said <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> officials will wait for a full police report before determining if any action should be taken against the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. The weapons used by the soldiers were their personal arms, he said. Police said two semiautomatic rifles, a shotgun, eight automatic handguns and a revolver were recovered from the soldiers. Some residents complained that tensions had been building all afternoon and said it took police 30 minutes to arrive after they were called. Police spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said he was frustrated that residents had not called earlier. `` There is a fine line between self-defense and vigilantism. Right now, we made no arrests because we think it's classified as self-defense, but that's subject to a prosecutor's review,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Renae </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartlett </PERSON> accused the soldiers of provoking violence by making a show of force in the neighborhood and accusing some residents of involvement in drugs. `` They was pointing those guns at us and saying they were going to move us out of the neighborhood,'' she said. <PERSON> Hartlett </PERSON> and other black residents of the integrated neighborhood said they saw racist overtones to the confrontation. <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>, who is white, said some Rangers were carrying handguns but denied that were brandished before the gunbattle. `` This had nothing to do with -LRB- race -RRB-,'' added <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON>, a black woman who was at the party.

 Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said. The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and only two were in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds. `` We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, and heeding evacuation warnings. The last big storm to hit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians would n't heed <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s warnings `` We've had so many close calls,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnet </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said. `` This time they realized it.'' <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official, estimated that 18,000 residents in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters. Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings. `` It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said. `` You've just got to say nice things about the people.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Garnet </PERSON> had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing. `` There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Orpheus Descending,' Starring Vanessa Redgrave, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with additional reviews</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s production of `` Orpheus Descending'' by <PERSON> Tennessee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is a first-rate revival of a second-rate play. The drama, which opened Sunday at Broadway's <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater </PERSON>, was brought here as a vehicle for <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> who scored a huge personal triumph with it in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last season. Miss <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> is often riveting, but the real hero of the evening is Hall who directs <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' overwritten, overwrought and oversexed fandango with the commitment of a true believer. `` Orpheus'' is n't `` The Glass Menagerie,'' `` A Streetcar Named Desire'' or even `` Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' but you'd never realize it from <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s fidelity to this overripe material. He revels in its excessive poetry and non-realistic structure. The director uses sound effects, music, lighting and even bizarre makeup for some of the characters to underscore <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' often obvious points about good and evil, carnality and purity. The play, set in a small, unnamed Southern town, intertwines the tales of Lady <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> -LRB- Miss <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> -RRB-, the bitter wife of a dry goods store owner, and <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON>, a young drifter she hires to work in the store. The two are kindred spirits, longing to be free from the ties of this terrible little town where bigotry, hatred and even murder are everyday occurrences. Lady, the daughter of an Italian bootlegger killed by local Klansmen, yearns for something better than her loveless marriage to a dying husband. <PERSON> Val </PERSON>, who used to sing in little clubs and bars along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, is a modern-day Orpheus. Now, he's striving to be a model of rectitude after a life of booze and women. Like Orpheus attempting to save Eurydice, <PERSON> Val </PERSON> eventually tries to rescue Lady from an unhappy life. Heavy-handed symbolism saturates the play, and there is a great deal of talk about little birds who never stop flying and if they do, they die; fig trees that supposedly are barren but finally bear fruit, and <PERSON> Val </PERSON>'s guitar which becomes a symbol of everything that is good and pure about his life and the only thing he really loves. Miss <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> plays Lady with an odd Italian accent that sounds unnaturally upper class, but the rest of her portrait is convincing. Her performance is earthy and intelligent, an odd combination that works well against <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Val </PERSON>. <PERSON> Val </PERSON> is the play's most problematic character, an obvious plot device, but <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> makes him into a credible human being. He also projects a sexy scruffiness that brings some truth to the physical relationship between <PERSON> Val </PERSON> and Lady. There is a wonderful moment at the opening of the play when <PERSON> Beulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Binnings </PERSON>, one of the town's bigoted biddies, spins out <PERSON> Lady </PERSON>'s past history to the audience in what amounts to a soliloquy. Her speech is the best written scene in the play, and actress <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> seizes it with a ferocity that is spellbinding. The play also is populated by a collection of stock <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> characters _ crazy, almost Gothic creatures who in the hands of lesser actors would verge on parody. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, wearing white pancake makeup and heavy mascara that makes her look like <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Newley </PERSON> in `` Stop the World _ I Want to Get Off,'' offers a compelling variation on the standard <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> woman with loose morals but a strong sense of right and wrong. And <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, after a shaky start, really becomes a batty religious fanatic who has visions and attempts to save <PERSON> Val </PERSON> from his past as well as his future. Other finely etched characterizations are offered by <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lady </PERSON>'s cancer-riddled husband; <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as his malevolent nurse and <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Henritze </PERSON>, Peg Small and <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, as a Greek chorus of small-town gossips. `` Orpheus Descending'' has an interesting history. It began life in 1940 as `` Battle of Angels,'' which was to have been <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' Broadway debut But the play, which starred <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, died in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and did n't make it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> until 17 years later, with <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> starred in the 1960 film version which was called `` The Fugitive Kind.'' This production does n't reclaim `` Orpheus Descending'' as a lost masterpiece. But it makes a persuasive case for another look at the lesser works in the large <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> canon. Despite the excesses of the writing, there is pleasure to be found in Miss <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>, the other cast members and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s unerring direction. Other reviews: _ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> called the fusion of <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tennessee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` an artistic explosion that was bound to happen. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> are `` brilliant theater artists'' who `` run at life bravely, openly,'' he wrote. But <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said the supporting cast was inadequate, `` whether through miscasting or underrehearsing.'' _ `` What a splendid start to the season!'' <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post </LOCATION>. He called <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s acting in the play `` atrocious,'' but `` oddly and unerringly accurate,'' and called the event `` a Broadway occasion not to be missed.'' _ `` Miscast, overdirected, exhaustingly overacted, the latest incarnation of ` Orpheus Descending' is a profound disappointment,'' wrote <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>.

 A Canadian marathon swimmer crossed the channel from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to the mainland for her final endurance swim of a year in which she crossed the English Channel and the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON>. `` I feel a little bit sore and tired, but I'm looking forward to eating seafood for the first time in six months,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said. `` I do n't like to eat seafood during swimming season,'' she explained, because `` I'm always afraid some big fish is going to come up and bite me because I ate one of his relatives.'' The 28-year-old marathoner was greeted by about 25 people when she waded ashore at <LOCATION> Cabrillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> at about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, a little more than five hours ahead of the 20-hour schedule she had set for herself on the 22-mile swim. As in each of her previous swims this year, Ms. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> used only the butterfly stroke. She was believed to be the first person to swim between the island and mainland using only the butterfly. Ms. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> ended an attempted July 28 swim from <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> about six miles shy of <LOCATION> Cabrillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> after flailing in a powerful current. She made Saturday's swim in 14 hours, 53 minutes and 26 seconds. Ms. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> cracked jokes about sharks and dodged ship traffic during the crossing. Two weeks after her first <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> effort, Ms. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> became the first person to swim the frigid waters of the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> in 33 years, organizers said, swimming from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In 1988, the Canadian mastered all five of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> in benefit swims that raised than $ 550,000 for a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> sports training and fitness center. This summer she also crossed the 42-mile-wide English Channel and swam 14 miles across <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in marathons promoting children's charities. Ms. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> hoped to raise up to $ 30,000 with Saturday's swim to support the pediatric AIDS Clinic at <ORGANIZATION> County-USC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artificial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Storefront check-cashing businesses in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s inner cities are helping to launder billions of dollars to drug dealers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, according to a published report Thousands of the small shops also defraud legitimate customers who want to transmit money _ often recent immigrants with relatives in their home countries _ by diverting the funds, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions. `` The magnitude of the problem is huge,'' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Considine </PERSON>, superintendent of banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. The most serious problems are in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, state banking regulators told the Times. The increase in the number of money-transmitting stores corresponds to the rapid growth in the illegal drug industry and to efforts by legitimate banks to comply with a federal law that requires the reporting of deposits of more than $ 10,000. Typically, a storefront operation takes drug profits _ sometimes packed in suitcases _ and deposits the money in a legitimate bank, sometimes under the name of a fictitious corporation. From the bank, the money is electronically transferred to another bank, leaving no trace of the real depositor's identity. The legitimate banks report the names of the corporations to the government, so the drug dealers's identities do n't show up in any records. A small percentage of the money-transmitting stores are licensed and regulated but the majority are illegal, unlicensed and unregulated, the paper said. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area alone, the paper said, bank regulators have identified more than 130 illegal money transmitters. The state has issued licenses to 35 companies, more than half of them issued in the last year, the Times said.

 Fire broke out on a 600-foot Danish ferry in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> early today, killing at least two people and injuring 10, the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said. The Tor <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> was carrying 540 passengers, mostly British citizens, and 110 crew members when the ship caught fire out at dawn about 90 miles off the west coast town of <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION>. The fire was under control within a few hours, the rescue center in <LOCATION> Arhus </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> said. The Danish radio said the ferry was heading for <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION> on its own engines. <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the shipping line <ORGANIZATION> DFDS </ORGANIZATION>, said none of the 540 passengers 110 crew members had been evacuated. One of the injured was flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION> because of asthma respiratory troubles. The nationalities or identities of the victims were not immediately released. The rescue center said injuries were minor and caused by inhalation of smoke. The blaze started in a linen closet in the bow on the fifth deck of the 14,893-ton ferry, owned by <ORGANIZATION> DFDS </ORGANIZATION>, or Scandinavian Seaway shipping line. The Tor <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> was on a regular ferry service from <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> on the Swedish west, to <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s east coast and to <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION> on the Danish west coast, the owner, <ORGANIZATION> DFDS </ORGANIZATION>, said.

Three helicopters from the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> and one from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> were dispatched to the scene, bringing medical aid, said a spokesman of the Danish Sea Rescue Center. The Tor Scandinavia, which can carry 1,500 passengers and 400 cars, was built in 1976 the Flinder ship yard in <LOCATION> Luebeck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and is one of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>'s largest ferries with swimming pool, gym and a move theater.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is preparing to challenge the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to match the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in making cuts of more than 50 percent in chemical weapon stockpiles as a step toward abolishing them, administration sources say. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to make the proposal today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in his first presidential speech before the 44th session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the initiative would `` move the world closer to a ban on chemical weapons.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' questions about his speech when he went for a brisk early morning jog prior to departing for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would propose `` significant reductions'' in chemical weapons that `` will improve the chances significantly'' of curbing their use. Administration sources in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said Sunday night that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would tell the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> he is prepared to slash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons stockpiles by more than 50 percent provided the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> makes similar reductions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to suggest sanctions against other countries which proceed with chemical weapons production, the sources said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> informed <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the president's intention in their talks over the weekend in Jackson Hole, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. There the two sides agreed on a two-stage U.S.-Soviet program to exchange information about their chemical weapons and to inspect each other's plants and arsenals. The president, who served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador in 1971-1972, also planned today to call for international cooperation on drugs, terrorism and the environment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was expected to salute steps toward democratic reforms made in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And he was to offer support for economic restructuring and reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, expressing confidence in the goals set out by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, officials said. The proposal regarding chemical weapons was described by one official, insisting on anonymity, as `` a new initiative to move forward in elimination of chemical weapons, to reduce stockpiles and generally try to give a new impetus to a total ban.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today also was meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. And, he was to meet with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to host a lunch for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, and with his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, also was visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a diplomatic reception and dinner. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the only nations that admit to having chemical weapons. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts estimate two dozen countries actually have the weapons or the capacity to produce them. `` The president has been concerned for a number of years about the horrors of chemical weapons,'' said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser. `` He made a major presentation to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference in 1984 on the possibility of banning chemical weapons and he will have some proposals tomorrow to advance that issue,'' Scowcroft said Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Meet the Press.'' As <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> twice had to cast the deciding vote to break a tie in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for continued production of chemical weapons. On one occasion, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s elderly mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, to explain why he had instructed her son to take an action that she disapproved of.

In a second phase, there would be more intensive on-site inspections of the submitted data. Among an array of other accords, they also reached agreement on the broad principles for verifying limits on strategic forces and nuclear tests. In a major development, the Soviets said they would drop their demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abandon work on its Star Wars missile defense program before concluding a treaty curbing long-range missiles, bombers and submarines.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is setting next year's superpower summit meeting as the target for completion of a treaty to slash long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent To lay the groundwork, and also hasten an accord on troops and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> probably will meet with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> twice before the summit, an official said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sometime between November and January, and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> afterward, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Sunday night. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who just finished two days of productive talks in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, are known to be considering locations other than <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the next meeting. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program this morning, declined to predict whether the treaty would be finished by the time of the summit meeting, which he said probably would be in late spring. `` If you ask me, ` will we have a START -LRB- Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -RRB- agreement?' I ca n't tell you that we will,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. A Soviet decision not to let a dispute over space-based defenses stand in the way is expected to improve chances of completing a strategic weapons treaty. But, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' program, `` We are not home yet by a long shot.'' Among the unsettled issues are procedures for verifying compliance with cuts in bombers, missiles and submarines. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> decision to deal separately with its objections to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> program was a major achievement. `` What I think you see here is an exercise of political wil by the leadership on both sides _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to move us forward across the broad range of our arms control agenda,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Later, on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said a strategic arms reduction treaty may be ready at the summit. `` If we ca n't get to a START agreement, certainly a summit will move it forward _ or should,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the success of his meeting with the Soviet foreign minister should silence congressional critics and dampen their appetite for unilateral arms cuts. Despite progress in the Jackson Hole talks to cut strategic, conventional and chemical weapons, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was still `` a military threat.'' `` I think it would be quite naive for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to talk about unilateral reductions of its strategic arsenal,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The next storm here may be in the state capitol _ or in court _ when outraged property owners fight back against a law prohibiting some people from rebuilding their devastated beachfront homes. Even as the toll of Hurricane Hugo was tallied over the weekend, debate erupted anew over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Beachfront Management Act, which is designed to prevent erosion and overdevelopment of the state's ever-shifting coastline. Under the act, certain beachfront buildings can not be rebuilt if they are more than two-thirds damaged _ a provision that would apply to many of the homes that were blown down by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. Even before the hurricane, decisions were pending on three lawsuits challenging the act. Now Hugo may prompt a reassessment of the state's hard line on rebuilding. On Saturday, state Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> asked Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to call a special legislative session to consider revising the law. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he would consider the request. Meanwhile, the permit administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, said a blanket permit might be issued to allow people to repair homes that are less than two-thirds damaged. For now, the owners are under the rules of the law, which took effect in July 1988. At the time, many lawmakers and environmentalists hailed the act as a solution to degradation of the state's beachfronts, especially along the popular Grand Strand resort area that runs from <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The bill was opposed by those in banking, real estate and tourism, as well as by several beachfront landowners. In general, the Beachfront Management Act sets three lines of demarcation for shore construction: _ No new construction within 20 feet of the actual or estimated dune line _ Buildings from the dune line to 20 feet back can be repaired with approval from the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> if they are less than two-thirds destroyed If two-thirds of a building needs to be rebuilt, it is termed destroyed and can not be rebuilt. _ No building of 5,000 square feet or larger can be built between the water and a line where beach erosion can be estimated to reach in 40 years With its 135 mph winds and powerful tidal surge, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> virtually destroyed most oceanfront property from Folly Beach to <LOCATION> Surfside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and caused extensive erosion elsewhere along <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 187-mile coast. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarafile </PERSON>, owner of an oceanfront home on the heavily damaged <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palms </LOCATION>, 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, said the beachfront law was a great concern and she believed residents would press for revisions. `` I think most people have n't even had a chance to see what the condition of their property is,'' she said. `` The real problem here is we have people whose homes are destroyed or partially destroyed,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think any law we have on the books right now can properly address this.'' Decisions on three lawsuits filed by <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents challenging the constitutionality of the law are pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, the state lost another lawsuit charging it illegally took land without compensation from an Isle of Palms property owner, who was unable to build on his two beachfront lots because of the law. An appeal of the $ 1.2 million judgment is pending. Despite the unusual circumstances created by Hurricane Hugo, a state <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member said the 18-member council would have to wait for legislative action before making exceptions to the law. `` I assume what we would have to do as a council is adhere to the law until such time changes can be made,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielding </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, a council member. `` We're to administer the law, and we ca n't change it unless the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as a whole changes it.''

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Denounce Egypt, Say Rebellion Must Continue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising today denounced <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s peace proposals and urged Palestinians to pursue their rebellion against Israeli rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two rival governing parties, meanwhile, moved toward compromise on the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> plan. Officials suggested further talks with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> before pursuing a controversial proposal for Israeli-Palestinian talks. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, masked assailants killed a 35-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> health worker with an ax, claiming he collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said it was investigating. <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhsen </PERSON>, who was attacked in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> district, became the 120th Palestinian slain by fellow Arabs on such allegations since the start of the 21-month uprising. He was the fifth killed in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> this week. The army confirmed the slaying and said police were investigating the circumstances. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has moved to prevent more attacks on suspected collaborators by dispatching a letter to activists in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> this week, urging them to stop slaying fellow Arabs. The latest underground leaflet, the 46th issued since the uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987, called for `` the continuation of our intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- with lots of awareness and alertness.'' The leaflet, issued today, criticized <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> for proposing a new peace initiative earlier this month `` at the same time as the enemy was increasing oppression of our people.'' `` There is no chance we can accept the 10 Egyptian points unless they include the obviousness and necessity for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in the political process on an equal footing with other parties,'' the leaflet added. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan does not specifically mention the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It also criticized the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> plan for failing to specify that negotiations lead to formation of a Palestinian state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> _ a main goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan supports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposal to hold elections in the occupied lands to chose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates for talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about an interim solution of self-rule. The Egyptian plan has been rejected by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> because it demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accept the U.S.-backed principle of trading territory for peace, and allow east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Arabs to vote in the elections. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc also reject <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposal to put together a 10-member Palestinian delegation for preparatory talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that would include two Palestinians deported from the occupied territories The idea is a compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which wants diaspora Palestinians involved in the talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> claims it would let the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> into negotiations through the back door. But the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s partner in the coaltion Cabinet, wants <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept both the plan and proposed delegation as a way to break an impasse in peace efforts. A showdown has been postponed until Oct. 4, when the Egyptian proposals are scheduled for a formal vote by the decision-making <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. One idea broached by Labor officials was to circumvent the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation plan by suggesting preliminary talks with the Egyptians before any negotiations with Palestinians.

 Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers bade farewell to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> today, leaving behind citizens worried that the dreaded <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is already taking advantage of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s pullout with new assaults Hundreds of army vehicles including artillery and tanks paraded in front of the Royal Palace as a band played a song celebrating the `` solidarity'' between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Several thousand people including <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> soldiers and schoolchildren lined the streets waving flags in yet another government-organized ceremony marking what <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says is the withdrawal of its final 26,000 troops. <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>, president of the Vietnamese-installed government, thanked the commanders of departing Vietnamese units 479 and 979. Twelve Buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted blessings. Cambodian and Vietnamese commanders embraced and were presented flowers from women in traditional costumes. After the brief ceremony, the soldiers headed east for the Vietnamese border on narrow Highway No. 1. That was a main route Vietnamese forces used to invade <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and end nearly four years of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule in which hundreds of thousands died. After an overnight rest, the soldiers were to cross from <PERSON> Svey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieng </PERSON> province to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Tay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> province, supposedly ending <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s involvement in the stalemated war against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and two other guerrilla groups. Other units were to return home by the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have called the six-day troop movement a fake, but the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> has beseiged the gem-rich western town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> in recent months, evidently to take advantage of a Vietnamese retreat from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border area. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claimed today it had captured the <LOCATION> Ratanamondol </LOCATION> district seat at <LOCATION> Sdau </LOCATION> township, on Route 10 which links the town of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. On its radio station, the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> called the area a `` major strategic position whose task is to defend <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> town from the south.'' A transcript of the radio report was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> is about 160 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged the guerrillas have seized territory around <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> but says it remains under Phnom Penh control. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s best division, the 196th, was defending <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> against some 3,000 guerrillas of elite <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> divisions 415 and 320, said <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanharith </PERSON>, a prominent newspaper editor who recently visited the front. <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> were raining 800 to 2,000 shells daily. He said the guerrillas trucked in ammunition from a short distance while <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> forces were supplied from bases 75 miles away. Since 1979, only soldiers have lived in <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, he said in an interview. The battle has intensified concern in the country over whether the army of the Vietnam-installed <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> government can handle the guerrillas alone. Some <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> residents have been stocking rice anticipating the guerrillas will cut off supplies to the city, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> officials said. Some senior government officials have been saving money and gold in case they need to flee abroad, Western aid officials say. Already many Vietnamese civilians, including entire villages of fishermen, reportedly have fled back home. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> toppled the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Lon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nol </ORGANIZATION> government in April 1975, and immediately drove the people of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> into the countryside at gunpoint. Attempting to turn <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into a primitive agrarian commune, they created slave labor camps that became mass graves. On Sunday, <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> urged the main non-Communist resistance leader, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, to break with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and return home. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s hands have been `` soaked in blood'' by the alliance, he said. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and other countries to keep what he said were pledges to stop military aid to the guerrillas once the Vietnamese have left. `` We have clearly seen that our enemy has prepared all eventualities for civil war,'' he told a news conference. `` The scope of the war will depend on the attitude of foreign countries.'' In a statement issued in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said today he would only take part in future peace talks if they are held within an international framework. He rejected absolutely any negotiations with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, and said a report on the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> station that he had agreed to bilateral talks `` does not correspond with reality.'' <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its territory, while <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has armed them. The Soviet ambassador, <PERSON> Rashit </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamidouline </PERSON>, has said his government is continuing arms supplies to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> but not increasing them as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> retreats. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have just agreed to resume peace talks. But he said he would not back off from his demand that any settlement must include dismantling the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> army and political organization. Talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> failed in July after <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> rejected guerrilla demands that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> be included in a transitional government.

 Fans of two rival soccer clubs hurled rocks, bricks and homemade bombs at each other and more than 100 people were hurt, including 12 policemen, police said today. At least 29 people were arrested on charges of rioting, police said. The brawl began Sunday night in the port city of <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> after a match between league champion <ORGANIZATION> Abahani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> ended in a 1-1 draw, police said by telephone. Police said the referee apparently stopped the game one minute early. One of the players punched the referee in the face and other players and fans followed, throwing iron rods, sticks, bricks, rocks and small bombs at each other, police said. Mobs also burned or damaged at least 25 cars and buses and looted six shops and a house near <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, police said. Police armed with steel-tipped batons intervened to try to stop the fighting, which lasted nearly three hours, they said. When they could not disperse the mobs, they fired at least 25 canisters of tear gas. More than 100 people were injured, police said. About 25 people, including seven policemen, were hospitalized in serious condition, they said. On Sept. 17, more than 100 people were injured in a clash at <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> after another hometown club lost.

 Afghan rebels have closed a critical supply route between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the war-battered eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a guerrilla group said today. About 1,000 fighters overran four government posts Sunday along the strategic 75-mile road near <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, a spokesman for the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was the scene of the bloodiest fighting in the rebels' 11-year-old war to topple successive Communist governments in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, located 45 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, was seen as a test of guerrilla strength following February's withdrawal of about 103,000 Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> But government troops dug in. Despite initial successes, particularly at the key Communist garrison town of <LOCATION> Samarkhel </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the guerrillas were stopped at the heavily fortified city limits. Guerrilla fighters have closed the <LOCATION> Kabul-Jalalabad </LOCATION> highway periodically but have been unable to keep it closed beyond a few weeks. The guerrillas' weapons supply will decide how long the latest blockade lasts, <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> also said guerrillas still block the key <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, a critical supply route between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reportedly closed in mid-September. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent millions of dollars in military hardware and humanitarian assistance to the guerrillas in the past decade. The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic `` holy warriors,'' also are bankrolled by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other Arab states.

 Two moderate earthquakes hit southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> today but caused no damage or injuries, authorities reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Geodynamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the first quake measured 4.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and the second, three minutes later, was 4.5 on the scale. Both tremors had their epicenter in the sea 18 miles west of <LOCATION> Pylos </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Peloponnesus </LOCATION>. Police said most of residents of the area felt the earthquakes but displayed little or no concern. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage if its epicenter is in an urban area.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> lodged a protest with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government today for allowing pro-democracy Chinese dissidents to meet in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and form a group dedicated to ending Communism in their homeland. `` It is indeed a rare case in international relations that the government of a country brazenly supports activities on its territory by a handful of foreigners aimed at opposing and subverting the government of a foreign country,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The statement came after a meeting between a ministry official and French Ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Malo </PERSON> in which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expressed its `` profound indignation'' to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s sharp response followed a three-day inaugural meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of the Federation of Democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. During the meeting, pro-democracy delegates from 15 countries elected dissident political scientist <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and student activist <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> as chairman and vice chairman of the new group. The federation is to be based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, Wu'er and other leading participants in the organization, including computer entrepreneur <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON> and prominent economist <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yizi </PERSON>, fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the June 3-4 military crackdown on the democracy movement and are wanted by the Chinese government on charges of counter-revolutionary activities. `` Their purpose in setting up the so-called ` Front -LRB- Federation -RRB- for Democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>' is to overthrow the Chinese government and subvert the socialist People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Allowing them to do so on French territory means that the French government connives at and supports their anti-Chinese government activities,'' the ministry said. `` The above-mentioned action by the French government is a brutal trample on the principles of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The statement said the French government should `` rein in at the brink of the precipice and truly abide by the norms governing state-to-state relations.'' If not, it said, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would be responsible for further damage to Sino-French relations. Relations between <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> already were badly strained by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s criticism of the June crackdown. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has in effect frozen high-level diplomatic contacts and joined other Western nations in urging <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to respect the human rights of students and others calling for democratic reform.

 Hundreds of thousands of people today attended a peaceful rally called by the country's major opposition parties to launch their campaign to unseat the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a loose alliance of the country's opposition parties, also used the rally to celebrate the 75th birthday of <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, the powerful chief minister of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state and a major opposition leader. Officials and police at the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where the rally was held, said as many as 1 million people attended. About 15,000 policemen were deployed to control the crowd, believed to be the largest ever at a political rally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Political analysts called the rally a direct challenge to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to call parliamentary elections immediately. The voting must be held by Jan. 4, 1989. `` It's almost like saying to the government: ` Here in the capital are our supporters.

The rally also was seen as an attempt by the fractious, often feuding opposition to show it has united. `` Only if the entire opposition is united can we overthrow the Congress-ruled government at the center,'' said A.B. <PERSON> Vajpayee </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one of about 12 groups that make up the front.

<HEAD>Report: Central Park Attackers Argued Over Whether to Kill Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the teen-agers accused of raping the Central Park jogger claims the group argued over whether to kill her to keep her from identifying them, according to a published report. A previously unreleased videotaped statement by one of the suspects shows that some of the attackers tried unsuccessfully to prevent the others from further harming the woman after she was raped, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The so-called `` wilding'' attack on the young investment banker, which left her brain-damaged, and the beating of several other people in Central Park the same evening drew widespread attention. Kharey Wise, 17, told prosecutor <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> in his second videotaped statement that one suspect, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, wanted to kill the woman but that another, <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, said, `` Do n't kill her, man Do n't kill her. Bad enough you're raping her. Do n't kill her, man.' But <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, 15, could not persuade the others _ <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 14; and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, 15 _ to leave the woman alone after the gang rape April 19, the paper said. `` <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> picked up a rock. ... <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> hit her in the face with a rock. That's what knocked her out, definitely knocked her out,'' Newsday quoted Wise as saying. He said the victim was struck with bricks and cut with a knife and fingernails before he could not watch any more. The attackers thought the woman was dead when they left her, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said in the taped statement, said the newspaper. In the three days that followed the attack on the female jogger, <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> interviewed six of the suspects on videotape: Wise, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antron </PERSON> <PERSON> McCray </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, 17. At Wise's request, she interviewed him twice, the paper said. <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jermain </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 15, did not make videotaped statements. All eight of the suspects also provided written statements. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are scheduled to appear today before <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON>, who is expected to set a date for the start of hearings to determine whether the statements should be admitted as evidence in the trial. The victim is undergoing rehabilitation treatment at <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Though she suffered permanent brain damage, defense attorneys say they still expect prosecutors to put her on the stand during the trial.

 Election officials voted to postpone this week's mayoral and city council primaries because Hurricane Hugo has knocked out power to so many polling places, officials said. The <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> elections board voted unanimously Saturday to postpone the primary for two weeks until Oct. 10. It may be the first election in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> or the state to be delayed because of weather. `` Then again, we've never had a Hurricane Hugo,'' said county Elections Supervisor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> roared through this city, some 200 miles from the coast, Friday morning, weakened from its peak destructiveness but still packing winds of up to 75 mph. In <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, more than 125,000 customers were still without power as of Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported. The county's mechanical voting machines do not need electricity. But the power company told elections officials Saturday that, at best, only half the city's 107 polling places, mostly in schools and churches, will have power by Tuesday. `` If you do not have sufficient light, voters ca n't read the ballot,'' <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> could n't even guarantee that electricity would be restored to all polls by the following Tuesday, Oct. 3. So the elections board decided to hold the primary Oct. 10. The delay affects the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mayoral primary, and at-large and district city council primaries in both parties. Incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Myrick </PERSON> will face newcomer <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest. There is no Democratic mayoral primary because candidate <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Madans </PERSON> has no opposition. The general election is in November.

<TEXT>
 Four days after Hurricane Hugo hit, residents of this once-picturesque barrier island began getting their first look today at a snake-infested shambles that has been cut off from the mainland. Two boats normally used for tours to Fort Sumter loaded 380 people and left in a driving rain this morning from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> for the Isle of Palms. Residents were allowed to take one suitcase to bring back belongings, and were expected to be able to spend only 90 minutes at their homes before the boats returned. The boats, hired by the city of Isle of Palms, were to ferry people all day. People carried sheets of plastic to cover holes in their ceilings, and brought backpacks, suitcases and cat carriers, hoping to find pets left behind. <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownell </PERSON>, who said she lived on the island all her 54 years, said the trip today would allow her to begin planning the rest of her life. `` I'll know where I stand and where things stand, and what arangments have to be made,'' she said. `` It's been terrible. It's very bad for your mind It makes you very apprehensive, not knowing.'' Only two people per household were allowed on the boats, and non-residents were banned. Officials refused to allow an insurance claims adjuster from <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Greaney </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to go, although he said two homeowners were policyholders. `` We tell people to take an inventory of their damaged belongings so we can get to work on their claims. These people have n't had a chance to go out and do that,'' <PERSON> Greaney </PERSON> said. `` And we're disappointed that there's going to be a lot of secondary damage because of this rain.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said today there was an 80 percent chance of rain through tonight and a 60 percent chance for storms Tuesday. `` It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to make everything a little more miserable,'' he said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, a policeman in the resort town of about 2,000, said damage on the island is widespread _ and so are the snakes. `` What I have seen is total devastation,'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. `` I've never seen snakes as big as I've seen in the past few days, every time we pick up a board. Construction was to begin today on a pontoon bridge linking Isle of Palms and adjacent <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island to the mainland. The pontoon, which would temporarily replace the twisted <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON>, should take at least two weeks; repairs to the <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> bridge could take six months, said engineer <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of the state highway department. The neighboring islands, located 15 miles from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and home to about 6,000 people, have been under martial law since the hurricane because of heavy damage and fears that residents could get hurt working on homes with no way to get medical attention. Like many others, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greim </PERSON> took a small boat to the island to check out his house. `` I ran to my house,'' he said. `` My house was structurally OK. It had parts of other houses in the yard. Trees are down everywhere.'' Fifty-five to 65 percent of the homes on the Isle of Palms are unsafe, propane gas is leaking and the roads are littered with downed power lines and debris, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. Many homes are standing on just one or two stilts. `` Last night we just sat here and listened and we could hear them falling and breaking. It's a very unsafe situation,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said. At a meeting Sunday, Mayor <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON> had implored people not to try to reach the island on their own. `` We're going to build the island back. We've got to stop the anarchy that's been talked about. We're not going to let anyone take over the city by force,'' she said. On Saturday night, acting deputy chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> quit when Ms. Bunch turned down his plan to allow residents to return. Several people have been arrested for looting, officials said, and there is a danger to boaters from submerged boats, appliances and debris in the surrounding waterways. The 15-member police department has been patrolling the island in garbage trucks, golf carts and bicycles because their cruisers are on the mainland.

 Judges threatened to strike unless they receive more protection from cocaine traffickers, and a congressional leader called today for the government to begin negotiating with the drug barons. Three bombs exploded Sunday night at banks in the capital but caused no injuries. The blasts are among more than 100 attacks that have killed at least six people and injured 130 since the government's war on drugs began Aug. 18. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, said today he favors a peaceful settlement with the traffickers. `` We have to open a way toward this initiative because we are bleeding to death -LRB- and -RRB- our economy as in ruins,'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said in a live interview with the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. The mayor of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, also said in a <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> interview today that `` after this war is over and there are many dead and destruction, we are going to end up at the negotating table talking with the drug traffickers. `` The dialogue would be Christian because it would avoid many deaths,'' he said. A contender for the presidential nomination for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON>, said in an interview published in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> today that if the government's war against the traffickers fails, `` the road left is legalization of drugs.'' <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> is a strong front runner for his party's nomination for the presidential elections next March. At the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, editor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said in a signed column Sunday that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s congressmen are cowards for not joining the fight against the drug traffickers. In reference to stories in Colombian newspapers recently that some Colombian congressmen have been denied visas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of links to drug traffickers, <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said: `` We have finally hit bottom. Hitting bottom, we will know how many parliamentarians are aligned with the easy money.'' <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, then publisher of the paper, was assassinated by drug traffickers in 1987. On Sept. 2, a car bomb with an estimated 500 pounds of dynamite exploded, causing heavy damage to the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> building. Judicial union officials were to meet today with acting Justice Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> to discuss security, which they say should include bulletproof cars and vests, guards with metal detectors at their offices and other security measures. `` We do n't see any will on the part of the government to increase security for our lives,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday in a communique. <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, who resigned as justice minister last week after being threatened by drug traffickers, said she was promised $ 19 million in extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid earlier this month to protect judges. The union said it has heard nothing since about the aid. Colombian judges say that in the meantime many of them earn so little that they are forced to take a bus to work despite cocaine barons' threats to kill 10 judges for each suspected trafficker extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed and judges this year have repeatedly walked off the job or threatened to strike over a lack of security. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> says 1,600 of the country's 5,000 judges have been threatened with death in the last 12 months. So far just one such suspect has been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> decreed emergency powers last month in declaring war on the drug bosses. The army said Sunday that it had captured another, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, who is wanted on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Barco on Wednesday begins his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In addition to a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday, he is expected to plead for help in the drug war in an address to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Cocaine and coffee will be the topics of his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to the agenda published in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspapers in recent days. Colombians have complained that what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives military aid to fight the drug traffickers but costs <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> coffee revenues because of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s opposition to an international agreement on coffee quotas and prices.

Among his songs are `` Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' `` Always,'' `` <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON>,'' `` Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better,'' `` There's No Business Like Show Business,'' `` Cheek to Cheek,'' `` I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,'' `` Heat Wave'' and `` A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody.'' `` It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul,'' said composer-conductor <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> helped found. `` Your songs will be with us always,'' the organization said in a full-page advertisement in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today. `` Very few people have come to touch and move the soul of a nation,'' said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who joined a crowd of thousands in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> singing `` God <LOCATION> Bless </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' in honor of the songwriter Saturday. `` Mr. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> ranks among such people, a composer, a legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of our nation.'' `` This is a great loss,'' said composer <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON>. `` But <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> has left us with the greatest legacy through his music.'' Broadway theaters dimmed their lights Saturday night in tribute. On Sunday, more than 100 people held a candlelight serenade outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> townhouse. There was no indication if anyone was home. `` There was sobbing. You ca n't avoid it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, a composer and cabaret singer who led the group. He also has organized serenades outside <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s home at Christmas and on his birthday for about 20 years, `` but I never wanted to do it for this reason.'' Born <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baline </ORGANIZATION> on May 11, 1888, he was 5 when his family emigrated from <LOCATION> Temun </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The death of his father forced <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> him to start working at age 8. He worked in vaudeville, and as a singing waiter. In 1907, he published his first song, `` Marie of Sunny <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' and he had his first hit in 1911 with `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s Ragtime Band.'' Some of his songs have become pop hits across the generations. His `` Puttin' on the Ritz,'' made the charts when it was revived in 1983 by the Dutch singer <PERSON> Taco </PERSON>, and his 1926 composition `` Blue Skies'' helped get an album by country singer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> on the charts in 1978. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was an immigrant Russian whose `` God Bless America'' became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. He was a Jew whose `` White Christmas'' and `` Easter Parade'' became Christian holiday traditions. Though he never learned to read music, he wrote 19 stage musicals and 15 movie scores. Twenty-five of his songs have topped the popular music charts, according to <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> got a medal during the Statue of Liberty centennial in July 1986 from then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who appeared in the Berlin-scored 1943 movie musical `` This is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes, which began in the World War I era with `` Watch Your Step,'' starring <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, and ran through such post-World War II hits as `` Annie Get Your Gun'' and `` Call Me Madam,'' both with <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman </PERSON>. `` A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wrote for the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every Ziegfeld extravaganza. In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> did the scores of `` Top Hat,'' starring <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>; `` Holiday Inn'' with <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>; `` Blue Skies''; `` Easter Parade''; `` White Christmas''; and `` There's No Business Like Show Business.'' His last Broadway show was `` Mr. President'' in 1962. His last song, `` An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was awarded three medals for his music and a special <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> award for his contribution to the musical theater.

 Electricity finally flowed through five downtown hospitals in hurricane-ravaged <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, but thousands of people were without power and short of food, clean water or cash for a fourth day today. `` I eat where I can get a meal,'' said <PERSON> Renildo </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 26, who had no food at home and was eating barbecued chicken, sweet corn and butter beans from a mobile kitchen opened Sunday by the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> State Baptist Convention. `` My neighborhood looks like a trash barrel. Everything is out _ trees, light poles and cars overturned.'' Hundreds of Isle of Palms residents, meanwhile, began finding out whether Hurricane Hugo spared their homes. Boats that are usually used to carry tourists to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> began ferrying residents to the island, which like other barrier islands, has been off-limits since being evacuated last week. Aerial surveys showed more than half the island homes to be unsafe. Propane gas leaked, and power lines, trees and debris cluttered roads. But angry and worried residents had been threatening to defy the mayor's declaration of martial law and go to the island on their own. It will be midweek at least before people can go to stay, police said. `` When you come to the island, you better wear boots. There are snakes all over the place,'' Mayor <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON> told 500 homeowners at a meeting Sunday in Mount Pleasant. Ms. Bunch, whose own house was demolished, brushed back tears as she told residents: `` We're going to build the island back. We've got to stop the anarchy that's been talked about We're not going to let anyone take over the city by force.'' Coastal <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, hit hardest by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> as it swept onto the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland with 135 mph wind late Thursday, suffered billions of dollars in damages, officials said. Preliminary damage estimates in the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, area reached more than $ 366 million. But it will be days before anyone has accurate assessments of the losses. Insurance agents were going house-to-house, gathering information and handing out initial checks. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the storm could be one of the most devastating to ever hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. `` We're looking at damage between $ 1 and $ 2 billion,'' said Sheets, who is touring the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast today. Some state and local officials have placed the damage estimate at $ 3 billion or more. The death toll from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s six-day rampage stood at 51 _ at least 27 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and 24 in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, election officials voted unanimously Saturday to pospone this week's mayoral primary because the hurricane knocked out power to so many polling places. The election will be held Oct. 10. More than 100,000 <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> area homes and businesses remained without power today, and officials said it might be two weeks before electricity is completely restored. A National Guardsman and a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> police officer were struck by a car today while directing traffic at an intersection that was left without a signal because of the storm, officials said. Both were hospitalized, officials said. There were small signs of life returning to normal in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Garbage pickups were scheduled today, and five bank branches were opening, Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. Construction was to begin today on a pontoon bridge to link the barrier islands to the mainland. The only land link _ the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> _ was ruined and repairs will take four to six months, said engineer <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, about a block from the harbor, was one of five with full power late Sunday. `` It's amazing the difference it will make. We can run air conditioning so we can control temperature in the operating rooms,'' said administrator <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>. `` We can run normal equipment and just function like a normal hospital.'' <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON> said the emergency room was busy Sunday, with many people suffering cuts from chainsaws and axes they're using in the cleanup. `` We were delivering babies using flashlights,'' said <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCants </PERSON>, hospital administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, which also switched from generators to full power. At least 760,000 people in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> remained without power. Some <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents may be groping without lights and refrigerators for a month. Fifty churches in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> area Sunday asked congregants for donations for hurricane victims. Within hours, the items filled 10,000-square-foot room in the Carolina Coliseum. Trucks were expected to begin carrying donations to the coast today. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said people from around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have donated money, goods, blood and time to help. In an interview today on `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> asked Americans to keep sending money, building supplies, non-perishable food, disposable diapers, baby food and clothing. `` We've got a lot of people who are hurting here and they need our help,'' he said. In the three-county area around <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, 75,000 people were out of their homes, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Schools are closed until further notice, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remains in effect. There was evidence of tension during the weekend as the relief at having survived the storm wore off. Police said there was a report of gas being sold for $ 5 a gallon and of a company charging $ 3,000 to cut down five trees. An emergency law authorizing 30-day jail terms for price-gouging was enacted. At one supermarket Saturday, people waited four hours to get inside. On Sunday, a line for a hot meal stretched three blocks. Saturday, about 200 people began pushing and cursing as they waited for an ice distribution that never occurred. `` The people are short-tempered right now,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>. `` I'm frustrated, man,'' said 26-year-old <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, whose 2-year-old child was diagnosed with meningitis and hospitalized the day Hugo hit. He has been unable to get his paycheck from the restaurant where he works, and even if he could, the lack of electricity kept banks closed. National Guardsmen with M-16 rifles patrolled streets in the battered city of 65,000 people, guarding against looters and keeping order at locations where residents lugged coolers and plastic jugs to get fresh water and ice. `` People were ... begging for ice,'' Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` There were fistfights in the line. They were down-on-the ground fights _ men and women.'' By Sunday night, 27 people had been charged with looting in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, and about a dozen others had been arrested for such offenses as disorderly conduct, violating the curfew and petty larceny. As a cold rain fell Sunday morning, church bells pealed above the hum of generators and the buzz of chainsaws as residents of the affluent Historic District began repairing their homes. `` We have no roof and we've got 3 feet of water in the living room,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> at one church service. `` But we all have what we were born with and that's good health. ... Anything else is just gravy.''

 The government today unveiled a $ 750 billion budget that cuts military spending by 8.3 percent and increases financing for social needs, reflecting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s shifting priorities under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Finance Minister <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said the government is planning to cut the $ 192 billion deficit in half by raising $ 83 billion in new revenues and trimming expenditures by $ 10.3 billion. He told the opening of the fall session of the Supreme Soviet legislature that military spending could be cut because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s `` realistic and constructive foreign policy'' had led to an improvement in international relations. The decision to cut military spending from $ 119 billion to $ 109 billion is in keeping with a directive from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> parliament to cut military spending by 14 percent by 1991, <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said. Military research alone will be cut by $ 3.4 billion, he said. Officials say the 1990 budget is of an `` emergency character'' because of the deficit that has spun out of control as the country's economic situation worsens. The budget deficit is only the second the Soviet government has acknowledged. The finance minister said the government was planning to raise pensions for 60 million retirees by an average of 15 percent and reorient the Soviet economy toward fulfilling social needs. <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> did not immediately say how the government would raise the extra money. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet that the government will take firm steps to settle the ethnic dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> can not end it quickly. `` If the situation does n't stabilize, I think our government, along with the republics, will have to take concrete steps,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said over the dispute over the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, two neighboring southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republics, have been locked in a bitter 19-month dispute over control of the enclave. About 100 people have died in the ethnic conflict. An economic blockade of mainly Christian <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which receives more than 80 percent of its food and fuel via predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, has left shelves bare and industry at a virtual standstill. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not say what measures he had in mind, but in replying to legislators' questions <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated that he wanted the problem resolved within days. Located in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s area is 1,760 square miles, slightly smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The 1979 Soviet census put <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s population at 162,000, of which 76 percent were ethnic Armenians and 23 percent ethnic Azerbaijanis. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Supreme Soviet has been transformed from a rubber stamp for <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> directives into a lively forum for debate. The current body, chosen after spring elections that gave Soviet voters their first choice among candidates in seven decades, is scheduled to sit for two months. It has about 80 items on its agenda, including the matter of granting economic sovereignty for several of the country's 15 republics and methods for settling labor disputes, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The body will devote Mondays and Tuesdays to general sessions and the rest of each week to committee meetings. In its first session as a competitively elected body, the 542-member Supreme Soviet held confirmation hearings on Cabinet-level jobs and forced the withdrawal of several candidates put forward by the government. On the agenda now are calls by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>' first organized opposition group to permit people to own their own land, establish market pricing, permit independent television broadcasting and allow Soviets to move freely within their country Soviets must now carry internal passports and obtain permission to move into desired urban areas such as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and the government still denies external passports to many citizens. The group of 345 reform-minded deputies of the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, includes such Supreme Soviet legislators as political maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. The Supreme Soviet is made up of full-time legislators elected by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which meets at least once a year and was chosen in spring elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is calling for legalization of private property, and the introduction of market pricing. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s advisers also have promoted letting supply and demand set prices But in the face of strong public objection to lifting government subsidies, the government has promised to delay the proposal for several years. The opposition group proposes that the vast industrial ministries, which now control the supplies and decisions of most factories in the country, be replaced with small commissions of experts in the field. The group also wants `` an end to the government monopoly on television.''

 Salvage crews removed the wreckage of a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to check it for evidence of a mechanical flaw that might have caused last week's crash, while prosecutors weighed criminal charges against the crew. A grand jury could be asked to consider charges of leaving the scene of an accident or even criminally negligent homicide against the pilot and copilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400, a source in the district attorney's office told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Another source in the office told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that Queens Borough District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON> may offer immunity from prosecution to the copilot, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, in return for his testimony. <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>'s office on Sunday declared the crash site off <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> a crime scene. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a separate probe into Wednesday's crash of Flight 5050, which killed two people; 59 others were rescued from the partially submerged plane that skidded off a runway and cracked into three pieces. A lawyer for Kleissas and for the captain, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, said he saw no basis for a grand jury probe, and news reports indicated some investigators were skeptical the criminal charges would hold up. `` Based on everything I know, there is absolutely no criminal act committed by either pilot,'' said the attorney, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>. He said the two men have been `` fully cooperative with the regulatory authorities.'' But <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> were criticized by federal officials for failing to submit immediately to drug and alcohol testing, although they are not legally required to do so. They submitted urine samples for testing on Friday, but results will not be available for three weeks. The two pilots' flight licenses were suspended because they disappeared from the accident scene, authorities said. Crews on Sunday hoisted the plane from the river, and federal authorities said they would examine it to see if mechanical problems caused or contributed to the crash. The plane's front, tail and main fuselage sections were taken to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> hangar at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. Investigators said they found that the wheels under the jetliner's nose were locked to the right, indicating the pilot had turned them sharply to counter the plane's pull to the left. Authorities said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 36, has told investigators he aborted the takeoff because the aircraft was drifting to the left and he felt and heard a strange vibration. He believed he had enough room to stop the plane, but it skidded off the runway and into the water. At weekend news conferences, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> had inadvertently pushed a button that shut off an automatic throttle, but the plane's unexplained veer to the left also was being investigated as a cause for the crash. <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, 29, who had flown a 737-400 only once before on a passenger flight, was at the controls, but <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> manually took over the throttle after <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> pushed the button, authorities said.

 A passenger in the truck that collided with a school bus told investigators he reminded the driver about a stop sign moments before the accident that killed 20 students. School resumed today with a prayer for the victims after funerals for 16 of the students over the weekend. Four other funerals were to be held today. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, an assistant to the soft drink deliveryman, said Sunday he told driver <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, `` You have a stop here.'' Seconds later, he said, the truck plowed through the stop sign and into the school bus, causing it to tumble a water-filled pit. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>'s statements came in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators, who on Sunday re-enacted the crash on a two-lane road 15 miles from the Mexican border. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> has told authorities his brakes failed before he went through the stop sign. At Mission Junior High today, students and teachers joined hands and prayed before class. `` What I feel in my heart and soul is that none of the students who died in the bus accident deserved to die this young or in this manner,'' principal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbenante </PERSON> said over the school's public address system during homeroom period. <PERSON> Abbenante </PERSON> said counselors also would be available all day and permits would be given for students to attend the remaining funerals. As classes began, tearful students came to the office to ask for counseling and permission to leave. The principal read the names of the victims and dedicated the school year to them. School employees wore special mourning ribbons; maroon and white, the school's colors, with a strip of black. Teachers at the junior high also placed the ribbons on their car antennas. Only five students, all from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, today rode the route of the crashed bus. Buses on other routes appeared full. There were 81 people aboard the bus; all 61 survivors were injured, and the driver and two students remained hospitalized today. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> also were injured. The truck, which weighed about 44,000 pounds loaded, was traveling about 45 mph and was about 300 feet away from the intersection when <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of the stop sign, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> chief investigator <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. `` The driver then applied the foot brake and the trailer brake, and downshifted into fourth gear,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said investigators could not disclose any conclusions they might have drawn from <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>'s account. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> told investigators that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had not mentioned any brake problems with the truck before the wreck, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. They had just delivered soft drinks to a convenience store before the accident occurred. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials hoped to interview the bus driver, <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, today, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. The two Penas are not believed to be related. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> was critically injured in the accident and was moved out of the intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. In nearby Mission, counselors today were to follow the schedules of the high school and middle school students who died, said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, coordinator of counseling and guidance services for the school district. The counselors were to answer any questions that are necessary, offer help to children unable to deal with the tragedy, Mrs. <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> said. Counselors from nearby districts and social service agencies have volunteered their help, she said. `` Everybody's kin to everybody else around here,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, senior counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it's not friends that they knew on the bus, it's relatives.'' Seven high school and 13 <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students were killed. <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, 17, a Mission High student who lost two close friends, said, `` It's hard to think that one moment they're with us and the next moment they are gone.'' Miss <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said she would give daily rides to 14-year-old <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, a junior high student who was the last to get on the bus before Thursday's accident. Ms. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, hospitalized until Saturday, said she has suffered nightmares since she escaped through a window in the submerged bus.

 A daylong downpour left 30 city blocks with up to 10 feet of water, killing two people in `` streets flowing like rivers,'' authorities said. There was an unofficial report of 11 inches of rain falling Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> building in downtown <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, although the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said its official gauges elsewhere in the city received only 2.45 inches. The <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it was possible that much heavier amounts fell in parts of the city. Apalachicola, to the west in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle, received 5.72 inches in the same 24-hour period. Rain continued to fall today and forecasters said more flooding was possible. The rain was blamed on a stationary front. Sunday's rain was `` just out of proportion to anything I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Elphick </PERSON>, who measured a foot of water in her back yard and 4 inches in her garage. Police and rescuers struggled to reach those trapped by the high water. `` We're being delayed because many vehicles are blocking the roads,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 73, drowned when caught underwater in her car for 15 minutes, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. A man whose car was swept 50 feet from a street into a drainage ditch also drowned when his car sank after fruitless efforts by a passer-by to help him open a window, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. The victim was not immediately identified. Major intersections and portions of Interstates 95 and 10 were closed for one to two hours Sunday afternoon, said <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` We've got streets flowing like rivers,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. A shelter opened at the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> gymansium Sunday afternoon but was closed at 11 p.m. after the 12 people who sought shelter there either returned home or found lodging with someone else, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeples </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, officials had estimated that 100 people were spending the night there. There was no estimate on how many people had to leave their homes and got shelter with friends and relatives.

<TEXT>
 Classrooms in nearly every <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> school district were empty today as teachers staged a one-day strike to protest low funding, overcrowded classrooms and inadequate supplies. The walkout, the largest by educators in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> in a quarter century, involved nearly 20,000 teachers and affected 450,000 students in 800 schools, officials said. Only two of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s 40 school districts closed for the day, state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancher </PERSON> said. The exceptions were the <PERSON> Daggett </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION> districts, both in the sparsely populated northeastern corner of the state. The South Summit schools were expected to operate without teachers. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest teachers' union, said its local affiliates voted unanimously to support the walkout. The <ORGANIZATION> UEA </ORGANIZATION> says it represents 85 to 90 percent of the state's educators. Saturday's action was spurred by a spontaneous walkout that began Friday morning at <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and spread to schools in three other large school districts by the end of the day. The strike apparently was incited by anger over the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in a special session last week to give Utahns a $ 38.4 million tax rebate, and not to allocate money to education from a $ 94 million surplus. Teachers are decrying low pay, large classes and inadequate school supplies. Teachers' pay in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> ranks 43rd in the nation, $ 4,500 less than the average national salary of $ 29,400, the association says. Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, at a Sunday evening news conference, said he sympathized with the teachers but thought they should wait for the January legislative session to press their demands. `` I agree with the teachers that education needs more money,'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said. `` I do n't agree with the tactic.'' However, he acknowledged that the walkout `` draws attention to the serious problems that exist in the school system.'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> pledged that education would be treated `` honorably and honestly'' in January. He said the surplus may approach $ 185 million by year's end, but said that not all of that would go to education. `` We have other state needs,'' he said. The public schoolteachers had urged their university counterparts to join the walkout, but there was no sign that large numbers of faculty were doing so this morning. At the Univeristy of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, psychology professor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> had said some professors might cancel classes or use the time for discussions on what he called `` the education crisis'' in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. However, no classes had been canceled by midmorning on the first day of fall quarter, said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Rise to Highest Level in Six Months</HEAD>

 Lower interest rates lured buyers back into the existing home market last month when sales rose 3.3 percent to their highest level in six months, a real estate group reported Monday. `` The August improvement ... reflects buyers taking advantage of the declining interest rates during June and July to get into the housing market,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. The Realtors reported existing single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units last month, up from July's revised 3.33 million units. The August pace was the best since February's 3.48 million units. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that fixed-rate home mortgages were averaging 10.03 percent, down from their peak rate of 11.22 percent in March. The Realtors' report also said the median price of a home fell $ 1,800, to $ 94,900, in August, down 1.9 percent from July. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less. <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said the seasonal decline in the median price suggested that many sales were to entry-level buyers coming in at the low end of the market. `` But the bulk of the market, roughly two-thirds, continues to be repeat home buyers, so there is still much to be done to ease affordability conditions for potential first-time buyers,'' he said. The August sales pace was 6.8 percent below the August 1988 rate of 3.69 million units. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, the Realtors' chief economist, said he expected existing single-family sales to total about 3.41 million in 1989, down about 5 percent from last year's 3.59 million. The Northeast showed the largest sales improvement over July with a 7.3 percent gain to a seasonally adjusted 590,000 units. However, the August pace was 13.2 percent below that of the same month a year ago. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> registered a 4.4 percent gain to 950,000 units, followed by the South with a 3.4 percent advance to 1.35 million units. The West showed the only decline in sales, down 3.5 percent to 550,000 units. Median prices were $ 148,400 in the Northeast, $ 72,300 in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, $ 87,400 in the South and $ 139,400 in the West.

<TEXT>
 Winning the war on drugs may require legalizing the personal use of cocaine and buying up the entire coca leaf crop, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Monday. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Larco-Cox </PERSON> noted the emergence of international drug gangsters and alliances between terrorists and drug traffickers. To break up the lucrative illegal drug trade, he proposed `` the partial conversion of the -LRB- foreign -RRB- debt into resources to fight illegal drug trafficking, the legal acquisition of the whole of the coca leaf production and, finally, the decriminalization of consumption.'' Although <PERSON> Larco-Cox </PERSON> said his proposals were tentative, he described them as going `` beyond the stage of reciprocal accusations between producing and consuming countries.'' He said simply suppressing the cultivation of the coca leaf, from which thousands of Peruvian peasants derive their income, `` would be promoting a social problem of hunger and a protest which may swell subversion and the relocation of illegal crops.'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is fighting both the cocaine trade and the Shining Path leftist insurgency, which is promoting a Maoist-style peasant revolution in the Andean mountains.

 Trade disputes between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should not stand in the way of greater cooperation in space, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> agreed that their nations would work together on a project to measure the effects of solar radiation on the earth's magnetic field. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the best hope for space exploration and pioneering the `` last frontier.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken and will continue to take the lead in space activities and we believe <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be a very good partner in exploration of space,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters. Asked about Japan-Soviet space cooperation, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not comment directly, but said, `` I'm convinced the best hope for space exploration and pioneering rests with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, facing financial and political problems in its own space program, has made overtures to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on joint development of space aircraft. The Soviet space agency plans to include a Japanese journalist in a crew traveling to the Soviet Mir space station in 1991. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said a trade dispute over satellites should be treated separately from overall cooperation in space exploration. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade legislation dubbed the `` Super 301,'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could face retaliation for what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials charge is its refusal to buy competitively priced U.S.-made satellites. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have a partnership in space activities. Super 301 will be treated separately. That issue should not be a hindrance in cooperation in space,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The exploration of space is an expensive proposition. Therefore, we need international cooperation and contributions of partners such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Monday's agreement calls for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to provide a satellite and scientific instruments, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to provide equipment and launch the satellite in 1992, said a joint statement issued by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who attended a luncheon with Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> on Monday, leaves Tuesday for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 High school students returned to classes throughout <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Monday after an absence of more than a year while the country went through a pro-democracy uprising and bloody military repression. Schools were closed in June 1988 following demonstrations that urged the end of a quarter century of authoritarian rule. High school and university students were at the forefront of the uprising, crushed Sept. 18, 1988 by a military junta. Primary schools reopened June 19 and middle schools August 14. Universities and colleges remain closed but officials say they will be opened before the end of the year. No incidents were reported as high school students, who numbered nearly 250,000 by last year's count, returned to class. Although the military government has promised general elections next year, it has been criticized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries for continuing human rights abuses, such as detention and torture of political dissidents.

 The environment must be protected with the help of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other major industrial countries to raise living standards in the Third World, says B.T.G. <PERSON> Chidzero </PERSON>, the finance minister of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. He is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which brings together members of governments from the Third World and richer countries. Its sessions, part of the annual meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, ended Monday. `` Neglect of the environment will increase the cost of development,'' <PERSON> Chidzero </PERSON> told reporters. `` The environment is a long-term investment. ... Neglect may superficially facilitate development, but not in the long run.'' His statement contrasted with the view, once widely held in the Third World, that efforts at conservation are an obstacle to their progress or even part of a plot by former colonial powers to hold them back. <PERSON> Chidzero </PERSON> appeared at a news conference on a <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report, `` World Bank Support for the Environment,'' made public Monday. The bank is owned by 152 countries, with the largest voting power in the hands of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is the largest source of development loans to Third World countries. Figures the bank made public last week showed a continuing decline of incomes in many Third World countries in 1988. Figures from its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, indicate a continued decline of average incomes in much of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has been heavily criticized by environmentalists and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as neglecting or even undercutting conservation. For example, it helped build a major road in western <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> that brought in large numbers of settlers whose main purpose was to destroy the rain forest so they could plant crops. Managers of the bank have countered criticism with increased attention to environment issues. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has been part of the problem in the past, it can and will be a strong force in finding solutions for the future,'' Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a new brochure issued by the bank. The brochure is called `` Striking a Balance _ The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Challenge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The bank's goal is to blur the lines between environmental activities and the rest of the bank's work,'' it said. The bank approved more than $ 21 billion in new loans last year. It has been trying to take environmental protection into account each time it makes a loan. On Sunday it announced that it a new phase of a joint project with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to help clean up the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. Initially it will have $ 10 million to $ 15 million to spend. The brochure told of moving a group of <LOCATION> Patagonian </LOCATION> conures, a rare parrot, to new breeding areas when the old ones were about to be disturbed by a dam under construction in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Other projects will help manage forests in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and promote reforestation in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>.

 A low overpass ripped a valve off a propane truck today, allowing highly flammable propane gas to spew into the air, and the truck blocked evacuation of a subdivision, authorities said. `` You've got a lot of gas. You ca n't move the truck. It's a very dangerous situation,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. No injuries, fire or explosions were reported. Electricity in the area was shut off to prevent ignition of the propane. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said many of the estimated 300 to 400 people authorities wanted to evacuate from the area were being concentrated instead in a community hall at the opposite end of their subdivision from the truck. Earlier, he said they had been evacuated. The subdivision, which contains about 600 homes, is at the northern end of <LOCATION> Aquidneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and is surrounded by water on three sides. The only roads out of it pass through the site where the truck was wedged under the low railroad bridge. If necessary, the residents would be led out of the area on foot across a golf course, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the leak was bigger than authorities first thought and estimated it would take several hours for all the 1,900 gallons of liquefied propane to vaporize. He said it had proved to be impossible to transfer the propane to another truck. The wind, which had been blowing the gas away from the homes, had shifted by midday and was bringing it closer to the homes, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. Players were evacuated from a nearby golf course. Golf pro <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Diemoz </PERSON> said he had to drive the course in a golf cart to round up players. `` They said this thing has the potential to create a fireball that could last for a mile, and we were downwind of it,'' <PERSON> Diemoz </PERSON> said. A highway through the area was closed, as was a bridge linking <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Aquidneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> town of 15,000, to <LOCATION> Tiverton </LOCATION> on the mainland. The truck missed clearing the overpass by just a few inches, said Fire Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` He did n't tear the tank open,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` He knocked a valve off the top of the tank that was protruding.'' The bridge is 9 feet, 5 inches high and the truck missed clearing it by just a few inches, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. The propane was allowed to continue leaking as it vaporized, because authorities feared it would be too risky to try to cap the leak, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, air traffic manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was considering closing the area within a five-mile radius to aircraft because of the threat of ignition. He did not know if that would disrupt takeoffs or landings at any nearby airports. An emergency response team from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> was on the way, spokeswoman <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Segerson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Oil Company to Lay Pipe the Old-Fashioned Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSHOCTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court is being asked to decide whether an oil company seeking to replace a pipe will have to do it the old-fashioned way _ with human hands and horses. In August, Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gathering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could not be barred from replacing the pipe it installed more than 60 years ago. But he said the company could not use heavy machinery that might damage property outside the 10-foot easement it was granted in 1924. The property owner, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrimplin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, had fought the company's efforts to replace the pipe. The company had argued that the easement was not practical for modern machinery and said the primary purpose of the easement, granted by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, the property's previous owner, was to give the company access even if it damaged the land. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> sided with <PERSON> Shrimplin </PERSON>, citing a handwritten statement by <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> in the original document that said: `` This grant covers the pipe line in the place and manner it is now laid.'' The judge ruled that <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s statement limited the methods and machinery that could be used to those available in 1924. While the company may employ some modern materials, such as welded pipe rather than pipes joined by threaded joints common to the 1920s, the company `` is not free to invade defendants' land with a horde of monstrous machines which subject the land to much greater damage than ... was ever thought of by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Foster in 1924,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` Crops and fences can be replaced in short order; native hardwood trees and valuable topsoil can not,'' the judge wrote. The company appealed on Thursday. A witness for the company, <PERSON> Reo </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said that when the pipes were laid, men with shovels dug the trench, the pipes were hauled to the site by teams of horses and the pipes were laid by hand.

 A 69,000-volt electrical wire touched a scaffolding being moved at a construction site today, killing three workers and injuring three others, authorities said. The accident occurred as six workers were rolling the 25-foot scaffolding away from a building under construction at <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> on the city's north side, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Target </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the general contractor. No one was on the scaffolding. The workers _ all men _ were putting up aluminum siding on the building, which is to be a distribution center. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the cable, which ran about 30 feet from the building, was carrying 69,000 volts of electricity, enough voltage to supply a small town. The electric company was called to cut power to the site. <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said workers generally do not consider wires to be a work hazard unless they are within 10 feet. He said they probably thought they had enough room to safely move the scaffolding, which was on wheels, to another wall of the building. <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>, 24, a Target Construction employee, said he was one of several workers installing a roof on the building when the accident occurred shortly after 10 a.m. `` I saws a big spark, and we went to the edge to look over and saw them all lying on the ground,'' he said. `` We got off of there ... we just started yelling for help.'' He said the six victims still appeared to be in contact with the scaffolding, so he and the others did not try to move them. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefer </PERSON>, fire battalion chief, said three of the men died, and the injured were taken to hospitals. `` They were all just lying on the ground. Two -LRB- survivors -RRB- appeared to be in pretty serious shape,'' <PERSON> Keefer </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure about the other one.'' <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which makes steel, is just north of Interstate 270, the city's outer belt. Traffic leading to the site was blocked off. A woman who answered the telephone at <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION> said she had no details about the accident. She referred questions to a spokesman who did not immediately return telephone calls.

 The former husband of Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> today challenged the constitutionality of a law designed to free his former wife after 25 months behind bars for concealing their daughter in a bitter custodey battle. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> remained in jail, awaiting action on a weekend request filed by her lawyers that she be freed. In a brief filed with the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, lawyers for <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s former husband, Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, claim the legislation, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed Saturday, infringed on the powers of the local courts. The attorney, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON>, also said the bill violated <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>'s rights and those of the couple's daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, 7. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also expressed reservations to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the law might be an unconstitutional intrusion by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the powers of the judicial branch to enforce its orders, according to a department source who declined to be identified. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, chief spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, refused to say what kind of advice the department had given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before he signed the measure. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has been in jail rather than produce the child for a court-ordered visit with <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, claiming he had sexually abused <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> denies the allegation. The child remains in an undisclosed location. `` We have not heard anything on how the court will handle it,'' said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>. `` It's really in the court's hands. `` We're hopeful the court will act promptly, but we have no guarantees,'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON> said the court could order a hearing on the case and that there was no guarantee that the court would immediately issue an order freeing <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case last year, and the full court held a rehearing last Wednesday. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON> both stressed that the bill does not require Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> to produce the girl. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> said he would be `` delighted'' to have his former wife released, if the federal government helped him find their daughter. `` But until they're willing to do that, I do n't see where I have any choice but to concern myself with the violation of my rights and those of my daughter,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said jail officials required a court order to release <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to direct the attorney general to either appoint a special prosecutor or tell the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to help find the child. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has offered a $ 5,000 reward to anyone who could provide information on <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s whereabouts. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill `` out of compassion for her plight'' after members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also concerned about her case, passed legislation to free <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. The measure signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, which will be applied retroactively to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s case, sets a one-year limit on civil contempt jailings in child custody cases in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The law is to expire after 18 months.

 An 18-year-old was charged today with murder and arson in the highway construction site explosion that killed six <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> firefighters last Nov. 29. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was indicted Friday by a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury. He was charged with knowingly burning something and with six counts of felony murder because of the deaths resulting from the fire. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, being held in jail on unrelated charges, could face up to life in prison if convicted of felony murder. The firefighters were responding to an early morning fire at the construction site in southern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when a trailer storing about 30,000 pounds of explosive blew up, killed them instantly. About half an hour later, a second trailer, holding about 15,000 pounds of explosives, also detonated. The explosions broke windows up to 10 miles away and were heard up to 40 miles away. The blasts left two craters 30 to 40 feet wide and 6 to 7 feet deep. According to police records filed in court today, an anonymous caller reported seeing <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> and another man, 19, run into the 19-year-old's residence shortly after the fire and explosions. The 19-year-old has not been charged. Police records also cited statements from two witnesses who were in jail with <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> who reported hearing <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> say started the fire to create a diversion after he and two other people went to the construction site to steal explosives. Another witness said he was present when <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> bragged about being involved in the explosions but said he had not meant for anyone to get hurt. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> pleaded guilty in March to an unrelated theft, and was placed on probation for a year. In July, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating terms of his probation.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, challenging the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to `` rid the earth of this scourge'' of chemical weapons, said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will destroy more than 80 percent of its stockpiles if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reduces its arsenals to an equal level. `` The world has lived too long in a shadow of chemical warfare,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, seeking to spur a 40-nation treaty conference aimed at banning the weapons entirely. While the chemical weapons plan was the centerpiece of his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also paid tribute to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for removing `` a number of obstacles'' on treaties reducing long-range nuclear weapons as well as troops and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took note of the array of agreements reached during a weekend of talks between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, as well as a decision to hold a summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by early next summer. `` Each of these achievements is important in its own right, but they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Serious differences remain _ we know that _ but the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we, and indeed the world, must welcome.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nationally televised speech marked his first to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> as president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador in the early 1970s, and told his audience it was a `` homecoming for both <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and me.'' His speech was interrupted twice by applause, once when he called for the elimination of chemical weapons, and again when he touched on the progress of the weekend superpower talks. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who will address the world body Tuesday, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech `` a constructive statement in the spirit of the times, in the spirit of the tasks that we are facing, that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is facing and in a broader context, too.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had a `` positive view'' of the chemical weapons proposals. In his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the world was witnessing a `` rise of freedom,'' and cited advances in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Make no mistake. Nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march,'' the president said `` Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state,'' he said. Yet, he cautioned, `` We have not entered an era of perpetual peace.'' He said regimes throughout the world were emerging `` armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said regional conflicts `` may well threaten world peace as never before.'' His offer to slash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapon stockpiles was both a challenge to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to follow his lead and an invitation to the 38 other nations whose negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to ban the weapons are moving at a snail's pace. `` Let us act together, beginning today, to rid the earth of this scourge,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> advance word of the chemical weapons proposal during their talks in Jackson Hole, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. The two agreed on a two-stage U.S.-Soviet program to exchange information about their chemical weapons and to inspect each other's plants and arsenals. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> admit to having posion gas. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said more than 20 nations possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. `` And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts,'' he said. `` This is unacceptable.'' He referred to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> both used poison gas in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. `` For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined a series of steps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was willing to take `` to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons'' and move toward an international ban to take effect 10 years after an agreement was signed. The three major elements of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan: _ While working to complete a global agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will eliminate more than 80 percent of its stockpile `` if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level, and we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said _ Once an international treaty is signed, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will destroy more than 98 percent of its current chemical weapons stockpile over an eight-year period, provided the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joins the ban `` I think they will,'' he said. _ The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed over the next two years after all countries capable of producing chemical weapons become partners to the agreement The Soviets acknowledge having 50,000 tons of chemical weapons; some analysts think they may have more. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never publicly released figures on its own arsenal; analysts estimate it totals 30,000 tons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would be difficult to monitor a total ban on chemical weapons but said recent research, as well as information obtained in recent arms control discussions `` makes me believe we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban.'' On other fronts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for international cooperation on illegal drugs, the environment and terrorism. He said narcotics were `` a menace to social order and a source of human misery whereever they gain a foothold. The nations who suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight. And we are.'' Urging a united stand on terrorism, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Hostage taking and the terror of random violence are methods that can not win the world's approval.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the General Assembly to condemn the murder of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was taken hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> while on a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mission last year. His captors said they hanged him this summer in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of a Moslem cleric. The president said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a `` soldier of peace'' and called on those resposible for his death to `` have the decency'' to return his body. `` And let us all right now _ right here _ rededicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> served so selflessly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a full day of activities at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Among them: separate meetings with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also scheduled a lunch for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, and with his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a diplomatic reception and dinner. In their weekend meetings, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed an agreement to exchange data on chemical weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plants by June 30. In a second phase, there would be more intensive on-site inspections of the submitted data. They also reached agreement on the broad principles for verifying limits on strategic forces and nuclear tests. In a major development, the Soviets said they would drop their demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abandon work on its Star Wars missile defense program before concluding a treaty curbing long-range missiles, bombers and submarines.

Two weeks ago she commented that she was afraid of going to jail for slapping Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> because there are lesbians in there. `` I have nothing against gays or lesbians. I have lots of gay ` boys' working for me,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said. `` I got letter from the lesbians and gay association. `` They are going to boycott me because I said there are lesbians in jail. How do I know who's in jail? Imagine a women's jail. There must be lesbians. ... Maybe I should become a lesbian. What do I know? I like men.''

 A tree planted by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Riverfront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> last week has been vandalized and is probably unsalvageable, officials said. A park worker Sunday morning found the 12-foot American elm sapling, grown from seeds taken from a tree on the White House lawn, uprooted near where it had been planted, Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicks </PERSON> said. `` We have no suspects and we have no idea why it happened,'' he said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON>, park superintendent, said after an inspection this morning that the tree was broken and uprooted. `` All three branches have been ground off,'' he said. `` It did n't look real hot, to tell you the truth.'' A park horticulturalist was going to see whether the tree's limbs could be grafted, but his `` gut feeling'' was the tree could not be repaired, <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON> said The elm was not marked as the tree <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had planted, because a plaque he brought along had not yet been installed, officials said. But it was the only recently planted tree in the park. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., planted the tree Tuesday during a ceremony in the park's Lilac Bowl The sapling was grown from seeds taken from a tree planted on the White House grounds in the 1820s by President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. White House groundskeepers have been asked about getting a replacement tree, but `` I'm sure that's a limited resource,'' <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON> said.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Well, Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General and distinguished delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, I am honored to speak to you today as you open the 44th session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. I would like to congratulate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, a distinguished diplomat, on his election as president of this session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and I wish him success in his presidency. I feel a great personal pleasure on this occasion for this is a homecoming for both <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and me. The memories of my time here in 1971 and 1972 are still with me today; the human moments, the humorous moments that are part of even the highest undertaking. With your permission, let me share one story from one of the many sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. I was the permanent representative of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I was 45 minutes late getting to the meeting, and all 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker to take the floor. And when I walked in and took my seat, the speaker paused with great courtesy and said as follows, `` I welcome the permanent representative of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and now, for his benefit, I will start my speech all over again from the beginning.'' That's a true story and, at that moment, differences of alliance, ideology did n't matter. The universal groan that went up around that table from every member present, and then the laughter that followed, united us all. Today I would like to begin by recognizing _ again, a personal privilege _ the current permanent representatives with whom I served, Ambassador Dugar Soon Rhen, Ambassador <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez-Ordonez </PERSON>, Ambassador <PERSON> Blaise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabetafika </PERSON>, Permanent Observer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dube </PERSON>. And it's wonderful to look around and see so many familiar faces; foreign ministers, members of the Secretariat, delegates and, of course, Mr. Secretary General, you were then the permanent representative for your country when we served together under Secretary <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Farah </PERSON>. You were a permanent representative back then, too. Ambassador <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was then here, and is now back, and off we go. And it's an honor to be back with you in this historic hall, and I apologize if I have forgotten any of you old enough to have served in 1971 and 1972. But the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was established 44 years ago upon the ashes of war, and amidst great hopes. And the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can do great things. No, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is not perfect. It's not a panacea for the world's problems. But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus, and it must remain a forum for peace.

 An East German court Monday convicted a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard of murdering 28 Jewish prisoners at a labor camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II and sentenced him to life in prison, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Holz </PERSON>, 79, was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his part in killing the workers at the forced labor camp in <LOCATION> Radom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: for peace.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> is moving closer to that ideal, and it has the support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In recent years, certainly since my time here, the war of words that has often echoed in this chamber is giving way to a new mood. We've seen a welcomed shift from polemics to peacekeeping. <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> Peacekeeping Forces are on-duty right now, and over the years, more than 700 Peacekeepers have given their lives in service to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Today, I want to remember one of those soldiers of peace, an American on a mission of peace under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> flag; on a mission, really, for all the world; a man of unquestioned bravery, unswerving dedication to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ideal, Lieutenant Colonel <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. And I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace, and call on those responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family and let us all right now, right here rededicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> served so selflessly. The founders of this historic institution believed that it was here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law, not force, shall govern. And the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can play a fundamental role in the central issue of our time, for today there's an idea at work around the globe, an idea of undeniable force. And that idea is freedom. Freedom's advance is evident everywhere; <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where state and society are now in the midst of a movement towards political pluralism and a free market economy, where the barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and its neighbors to the west has been torn down. Torn down. Replaced by a new hope for the future, a new hope in freedom. We see freedom at work in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> where, in deference to the will of the people, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has relinquished its monopoly on power, and indeed, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where the world hears the voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the right to rule themselves. But freedom's march is not confined to a single continent or to the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where one by one dictatorships are giving way to democracy. We see it on the continent of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where more and more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for economies crippled by excessive state control. East and west, north and south, on every continent, we can see the outlines of a new world of freedom. Of course, freedom's work remains unfinished. The trend we see is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide. Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern themselves. But now, the power of prejudice and despotism is challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and alone, so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: all-powerful state.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 There are many reasons for this collapse, but in the end, one fact alone explains what we see today, advocates of the totalitarian idea, so it's triumph written in the laws of history. They failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart. Two hundred years ago today, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ proposed the <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, fundamental freedoms belonging to every individual, rights no government can deny. Those same rights have been recognized in this Congress of Nations, in the words of the universal Declaration of Human Rights, a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. From where we stand, on the threshold of this new world of freedom, the trend is clear enough. If, for those who write the history of our times, the 20th century is remembered as the century of the state, the 21st century must be an era of emancipation, the age of the individual. Make no mistake; nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to be universal birthright _ a universal birthright of every man and woman, of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst circumstances, at the darkest of times, freedom has always remained alive; a distant dream, perhaps, but always alive. Today that dream is no longer distant. For the first time, for millions around the world, a new world of freedom is within reach. Today is freedom's moment. You see, the possibility now exists for the creation of a true community of nations, built on shared interests and ideals, a true community, a world where free governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people to control their own destiny, to live in dignity and to exercise freely their fundamental human rights. It is time that we work together to deliver that destiny into the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of freedom, encourage its advance, and face our most urgent challenges, the global challenges of the 21st century _ economic, health, environmental well-being, the great questions of war and peace. First, global economic growth. During this decade, a number of developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world's most advanced economies, all of them, each and every one, powered by the engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead, others can join their ranks. But for many nations, barriers stand in the way. In the case of some countries, these are obstacles of their own making _ unneeded restrictions and regulations that act as dead weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But other barriers to growth exist, and those too require effective action. Too many developing countries struggle today under a burden of debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over their own economic fate and build better lives for their own people. The approach the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has put forward, the Brady Plan, will help these nations reduce that debt, and at the same time encourage the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth. In just two days, I will be speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, and I'll discuss there in more detail the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key to continued growth in the developing world. Today, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> buys over one-half of the manufactured exports that all developing nations combined sell to the industrialized world. It's time for the other advanced economies to follow suit, to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe we'll learn, in the century ahead, that many nations of the world have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few; they are a harvest that everyone can share.

<HEAD>Scientists Make Final Quest for Rembrandt's Bones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a final bid to recover the bones of one of this city's greatest sons, scientists are peeling away thin layers of soil on the spot where they hope <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rijn </PERSON> was buried 300 years ago. The grave of the painter's only son, Titus, surfaced during restoration work in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s 17th-century Westerkerk church, and students of <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s life believe the best-known of Dutch masters might have been interred next to Titus. `` We know that <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> was buried in the Westerkerk, but the location of his remains is unknown because he had no money for a tombstone,'' <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Stigt </PERSON>, the architect supervising the restoration project, said in a graveside interview Monday. `` Titus' grave seems as logical a place as any other,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Stigt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> survived his son by one year, dying in 1669 at the age of 63. `` It would be nice if we would know for certain where <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s grave is located _ so many tourists are asking for it,'' added <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Korthals </PERSON> <PERSON> Altes </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> stockbroker and the chairman of the church's fund-raising committee. Currently, only a marble plaque on the Westerkerk's north wall commemorates <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>. Best-known for his monumental `` Night Watch,'' on display in the Rijkmuseum here, <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> was a prolific painter whose innovative use of light made him one of the outstanding representatives of the 17th-century Dutch school. When the wooden floor was removed from the Westerkerk's nave several weeks ago, Titus' grave became accessible to scientists of the <ORGANIZATION> Anatomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leiden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 25 miles away. After a week of digging, the first brownish skeleton was found Monday at a depth of 6 feet, 6 inches. `` It definitely is not <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Stigt </PERSON>, who noted that in the 200 years following the opening of the church in 1631, people were buried in layers. `` It is uncertain whether we'll ever find Titus, let alone his father,'' said <PERSON> Harmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Beukers </PERSON>, a professor of medical history in <LOCATION> Leiden </LOCATION> who leads the research team. Graves, especially those inside churches, were regularly emptied to make room for new bodies. Down in the 6-foot, 8-inch-deep pit on Monday, three archeology students carefully handled the skeleton's bones, which were to be brought to <LOCATION> Leiden </LOCATION> for further study. But <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Stigt </PERSON> said digging must be finished by Thursday, when the construction crews will close the grave and start laying a church-wide concrete floor, putting a final lid on the graves beneath it. `` We're digging in a hurry, but we'll do the examination of the bones at a slower pace,'' <PERSON> Beukers </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. He said it would take months, if not years, to establish the identities of the skeletons. After determining the skeletons' age and sex, their particulars will be compared with the entries in the Westerkerk's burial books, <PERSON> Beukers </PERSON> said. Officials were unsure where the bones would be taken after they are studied. If there's a clear indication that one of the skeletons might be <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s, other tests will be done, <PERSON> Beukers </PERSON> said. `` We might want to determine the lead content of the bones, for 17th-century paint contained lots of lead,'' he said. But it's unlikely that when the Westerkerk reopens in all its former glory next May, the painter's grave will be one of the building's prominent features. `` Personally, I think that the chance that he's lying there is minimal,'' <PERSON> Beukers </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief builder testified today that he took an offer from evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> that would give <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a $ 300,000 salary `` if he kept his mouth shut.''

Under questioning from defense attorneys, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said that after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the ministry and <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> took it over, <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> sent him to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to make <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> an offer that included $ 300,000 salary, a maid, a security guard for a year, health insurance and phone expenses. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, wrote the offer down and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> wrote at the bottom of the piece of paper: `` I'm not making any demands on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. I'm not asking for anything.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s statement was apparently in reference to whether he would return to PTL. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of defrauding followers who sent <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 158 million and of misusing more than $ 3.7 million in ministry money for his own benefit. He faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines if convicted on all charges: 15 counts of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> testified about the $ 265,000 hush money payment to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, asked him to do a favor on Feb. 21, 1985. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> had legal papers with him and told <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> that if he did n't pay a woman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> $ 265,000 then she would go to The <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> Observer with allegations that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> raped her. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> came to him for help because <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> knew he would keep it confidential. Five days later, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said, he wired the $ 265,000 to an account number in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that was given to him by <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> knew about the payment. He said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> replied: `` No, I'm acting on my own.'' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> said he had the authority to spend the $ 265,000 because he was <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, he said <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> asked him to make up a bogus invoice for work never done, which he refused to do. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he agreed to make the payment in part because the Assemblies of God was named as the potential party in Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s proposed lawsuit `` I did n't think the church ought to be dragged into this incident,'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he did n't know Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s name and never heard anything else about the situation until <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s resignation in March 1987. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman, said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> not long after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned, but did not take any specific offer. Instead, <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> returned from the meeting with a hand-written list on Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s stationery of what the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> wanted from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said the list included <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s $ 300,000 annual salary for life, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s $ 100,000 annual salary for life, all rights to books and records, secretary and maid service for a year, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> lakefront house and attorneys' fees. `` I would like to think <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> just forgot the sequence of events,'' <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said.

 Beyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become international problems. We must develop an international approach to urgent environmental issues, one that seeks common solutions to common problems. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is already at work on the question of global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe. And I will tell you now, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do its part. We have committed ourselves to the worldwide phase-out of all chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean air for our citizens within a single generation. We've banned the import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the human predators who exterminate them for profit. And we've begun to explore ways to work with other nations, with the major industrialized democracies, and in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, to make common cause for the sake of our environment. The environment belongs to all of us. In this new world of freedom, the world citizens must enjoy this common trust for generations to come. Global economic growth, the stewardship of our planet, both are critical issues. But, as always, questions of war and peace must be paramount to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. We must move forward to limit and eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Five years ago at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> conference on disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, I presented a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> draft treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Since then, progress has been made, but time is running out. The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. This is simply unacceptable. For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat. Today, I want to announce steps that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ready to take, steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons, towards a treaty that will ban, elimate all chemical weapons from the earth 10 years from the day it is signed. This initiative contains three major elements. First, in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is ready to destroy nearly all, 98 percent, of our chemical weapons stockpile, provided the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joins the ban. And I think they will. Second, we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons, 100 percent, every one, within 10 years, once all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total ban treaty. And, third, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ready to begin now. We will eliminate more than 80 percent of our stockpile even as we work to complete a treaty if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level and we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed. We know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be a challenge, but the knowledge we've gained from our recent arms control experience and our acclerating research in this area makes me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban. The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare. So, let us act together, beginning today, to rid the earth of this scourge. We are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as well. And that's why we tabled new proposals just last Thursday at the Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> _ proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease military tensions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and move the nations of that continent one step closer to their common destiny _ a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is convinced that open and innovative measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international tensions. And that's the idea behind the `` open skies'' proposal, about which the Soviets have now expressed a positive attitude. It's the idea behind the `` open lands'' proposal permitting for the first time ever free travel for all Soviet and American diplomats throughout each other's country. Openness is the enemy of mistrust and every step towards a more open world is a step toward the new world we seek. And let me make this comment on our meetings with the distinguished foreign minister of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, over the past few days. I am very pleased by the progress made. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> removed a number of obstacles to progress on conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing. And, of course, we agreed to a summit in the spring or early summer of 1990. And I look forward to meeting Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> there. Each of these achievements is important in its own right. But they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>. Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and, indeed, the world must welcome. We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats to peace that nations face may today be changing, but they've not vanished. In fact, in a number of regions around the world, a dangerous combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. This development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out. Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before. The challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all of you, right here in this hall. Mr. secretary general, with great respect, you have made it your own. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can be a mediator, a forum where parties in conflict come in search of peaceful solutions. For the sake of peace, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> must redouble its support for the peace efforts now underway in regions of conflict all over the world. And let me assure you the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is determined to take an active role in settling regional conflicts.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: regional conflicts.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly public, and sometimes, like many of you, we work quietly behind the scenes, but always we are working for positive change and lasting peace. Our world faces other, less conventional threats, no less dangerous to international peace and stability. Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations who suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight, and we are. And let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of one country in particular, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where we are working with the people and their president, <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, to put the drug cartels out of business, bring the drug lords to justice. And finally, we must join forces to combat the threat of terrorism. Every nation and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must send the outlaws of the world a clear message: Hostage-taking and the terror of random violence are a message that can not win the world's approval Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake, terrorism is a means that no end, no matter how just that end, can sanctify. Whatever the challenge, freedom greatly raises the chances of our success. Freedom's moment is a time for hope for all of the world, because freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of its own. As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country, we do n't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better, we know that free government, democracy, is best. And I believe that it is the hard-won truth of our time, the unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of great struggle, of human suffering. And this is true, not because all our differences must give way to democracy, but because democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy, diversity finds its common home. At the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom of belief, freedom of thought and action in all its diversity, for human rights. The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have promised to remake man in some new and better image. We've seen the colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and democracy hold the answers. What men and nations want is the freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper in peace. When I began today, I spoke to you about peacekeeping. I want to speak to you now about peace making. We must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings. There's a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and it pictures President <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and his generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest in the history of my country. Outside, at that moment, a battle rages in this picture, and yet what we see in the distance is a rainbow, a symbol of hope of the passing of the storm. That painting is called The Peacemakers. For me, it is a constant reminder that our struggle, the struggle for peace, is a struggle blessed by hope. I do remember sitting in this hall. I remember the mutual respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives. Yes, I remember the almost endless speeches _ and I do n't want this to be one of them _ the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> sessions, the receptions, those long receiving lines, the formal meetings of this assembly and the informal discussions in the delegates' lounge over here. And I remember something more _ something beyond the frantic pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here, the heartbeat of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the quiet conviction that we could make the world more peaceful, more free. What we sought then, all of us, now lies within our reach. I ask each of you here in this hall, can we not bring a unity of purpose to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>? Can we not make this new world of freedom the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must. My solemn wish today is that here among the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that spirit will take hold and that all men, and all nations will make freedom's moment their own. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the work of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Thank you very much.

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s fledgling non-communist government needs such basic things as telephones and copy machines, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said Monday, urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and private American industry to help. `` The parliament's lack of even the most basic resources is mind-boggling,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Republican said at a news conference. `` They do n't have functioning phones, computers, office equipment or even copying machines. `` It is clear that a simple gift of a helping hand in these seemingly minor matters is a necessary first step in helping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to have a properly functioning body of government.'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last week as head of a delegation of present and former legislators, said the cost of such a gesture would be small but would represent an important `` first gift of democracy.''

<TEXT>
 Opponents of a holiday to honor murdered civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> filed papers with the secretary of state's office today to force a statewide vote on the newly enacted law. The opponents have until Dec. 21 to gather at least 43,350 voter signatures that would force a statewide vote at the general election in November 1990. If they gather the needed signatures, the law would be suspended pending results of the vote. Today's filing comes on the first business day since Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> signed a bill to replace the state's paid Columbus Day holiday with a King holiday. The group filing today is led by <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a conservative activist who opposes any holiday honoring King because he claims the civil rights leader had links to Communist groups. A second group, made up largely of Italians, has also said it plans to seek a ballot vote on the issue, but only because it wants the Columbus Day holiday preserved and not out of any hostility toward King. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. If both groups agree to use the same set of petitions to gather signatures, they can combine forces despite different reasons for seeking the vote. The lack of a paid King holiday had triggered convention and tourism boycotts of the state that cost it an estimated $ 200 million in business. Business executives also claimed it was threatening to derail the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area's bid for a 1993 National Football League Super Bowl.

 An era ended Monday with the last <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> launch of an unmanned rocket from this spaceport, where responsibility for sending payloads into orbit is being turned over to private industry after 400 liftoffs in 31 years. An Atlas-Centaur vaulted skyward at 4:56 a.m. with a $ 125 million communications satellite to link military commands with land, sea and air forces and for use by the president in times of crisis. For now on, when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs an unmanned rocket, it will have to buy launch services from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>. The space agency will continue to launch manned space shuttles from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> got its start and where it has launched nearly all of its rockets. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has one unmanned rocket left for launch, but it will carry its payload, a scientific satellite, from <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The launch is scheduled for November. So far, the space agency has seven contracts for private launches. The first, of a scientific satellite, is scheduled for June from one of four launch pads turned over to companies. `` It's always sad to see the end of an era,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Womack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> director of expendable launch vehicles. `` There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we have done have been fabulous,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahon </PERSON>, the agency's assistant administrator for space flight Monday's unmanned launch was the 448th for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, dating from a Thor Able that lifted off Oct. 11, 1958, hoisting the Pioneer 1 probe toward a flyby of the moon. It failed, as did several other early launches. But the agency's overall success rate is better than 90 percent. `` We have had a successful mission today; the satellite is now being tracked by spacecraft controllers after a flawless ride aboard its Atlas-Centaur rocket,'' said launch commentator <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>. The agency stopped buying Atlas-Centaur, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and other rockets early in the 1980s, opting to launch payloads from the shuttle once it exhausted its backlog of space boosters. Officials admitted after the Challenger exploded in 1986 that it was a mistake to rely on only one launch vehicle. Following that accident, then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> directed <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to get out of the business of launching commercial payloads and encouraged government support of private companies that wanted to provide launch services. Among <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s unmanned rocket achievements are: The Mariner, Viking, Pioneer and Voyager missions to the planets; 42 weather satellites; the Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronaut landings there; 94 communications satellites; scores of scientific payloads, and dozens of unmanned test launches for the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo man-in-space projects. The Atlas-Centaur, which made its 68th appearance Monday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, with 184 liftoffs, have been the workhorses of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet Both have a success rate of more than 95 percent.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British television inquiry into the <ORGANIZATION> Pam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 disaster said Monday that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> committed major blunders, including releasing the probable bomb-maker after a raid on a Palestinian group last year. However, the chief Scottish investigator into the bombing of the plane over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, last Dec. 21 said on the program: `` We are still on course to being able to put together a case that will reveal who was responsible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s current affairs program `` Panorama'' reported that investigators are convinced the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> _ long the prime suspect _ masterminded the attack. The group's leader has denied involvement. All 259 people aboard Flight 103 from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were killed along with 11 people on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. Scottish investigator <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, speaking on the program titled `` <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>: An Avoidable Tragedy,'' said a West German police raid in October 1988 and the discovery in April of three bombs similar to the radio cassette bomb on Flight 103 may be linked to the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster. `` There are clearly points of similarity that have to checked out and may indeed point to more than just a loose connection but a firm link,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. West German authorities arrested 16 men in the October raid on an apartment being used by the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> but released 14 of them, despite finding a radio cassette bomb, detonators and Semtex plastic explosives. Those released included a Jordanian, <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>. `` Panorama'' said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> is a known bomb-maker and widely believed by <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators to have made the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bomb and several others. `` There were major blunders by the West Germans ... -LRB- who -RRB- let the group's bomb-maker go in very strange circumstances,'' said reporter <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>. `` They took until April to find all the bombs he had made, including ones that could have been used to blow up commercial airliners. And they freed key members of the <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>, who were capable of regrouping their network,'' he said. One of the men still held _ on bombing charges unconnected with Flight 103 _ is <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON>, the top aide to <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> has denied his organization had any role in the attack but said <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> often built and used the type of bomb that blew up Flight 103. The West German federal prosecutor's office told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Monday it has `` not yet come up with a connection'' between <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bombing. <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said, without disclosing the source, that he had been told <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>, now in hiding in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, was a double agent working inside the Popular Front for Jordanian intelligence. He said this was apparently why the West Germans freed him. Asked why <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was released, <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, spokesman for the West German prosecutor's office, said, `` He was released because there was no urgent suspicion of his connection with a crime.'' Previous West German denials that there is evidence linking <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> and the October raid to Flight 103 have prompted speculation <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is trying to deflect criticism of its security operation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> last week fined <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> $ 630,000 for lapses in security procedures at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. But the agency said it was not charging that any of the breaches contributed to the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster. `` Panorama'' said that in addition to `` blunders'' surrounding the October raid, West German police also released a key <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> operative, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kweiks </PERSON>, last October. It said police failed to discover the true identity of <PERSON> Kweiks </PERSON>, who was carrying a stolen passport in the name of <PERSON> Ramzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Diab </PERSON>, and failed to fingerprint him. It added that <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> investigators want to interrogate <PERSON> Kweiks </PERSON> but he has now disappeared.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aura of confidence as he stood before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Monday and proclaimed `` we are witnessing an ideological collapse'' marked a striking moment in the modern era of superpower rivalry, following a remarkable series of Soviet concessions on arms control. The American president held out to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> delegates hope that they were witnessing `` a new attitude that prevails between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and U.S.S.R.'' The `` ideological collapse'' cited by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to the range of serious problems facing Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, from his country's faltering economy and rising unrest among ethnic minorities to the increasingly independent approach of Eastern European nations. Those problems have pushed Soviet leaders toward the concessions that allowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to speak with a confidence few of his predecessors could express in their <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> appearances. He offered a sweeping proposal to eliminate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet stockpiles of chemical weapons beginning with an 80 percent cut in the American arsenal if matched by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` It was a constructive statement in the spirit of the times,'' said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, choosing to ignore <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s other words assessing a decline of the Soviet sphere of influence. Progress made during the past weekend of meetings between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials created a sense of momentum and lent strength to the optimistic tone of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s words to a world that has lived with the threat of nuclear holocaust during 40 years of tension. But in his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speech the president also had to concede the fragility of progress in a world where the `` superpowers'' often are powerless witnesses to terrorism and to political and economic upheavals. `` We have not entered an era of perpetual peace,'' he cautioned, referring to regimes that were emerging `` armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction.'' High on the agenda at most superpower talks are `` regional conflicts,'' the limited warfare that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> once believed each could somehow control. Years of war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the intractability of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israel </LOCATION> conflict lessened the belief in what the strongest nations could accomplish. It was in that context that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked of a danger that such conflicts `` may well threaten world peace as never before.'' One measure of the problem facing the world even if the superpowers truly enter an era of coexistence and cooperation is the fact that only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> admit to having chemical weapons even though, as the president stated, more than 20 other nations possess such weapons or the capability to manufacture them. `` And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This is unacceptable.'' While the dangers throughout the world remain clear, so too was the progress made over the weekend during the talks between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. On issue after issue, the Soviets offered concessions while receiving little in return. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> abruptly dropped insistence that any progress on cutting strategic missile forces be linked to an agreement to limit space-based defense systems such as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative. Also withdrawn was the Soviet demand that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sea-launched cruise missiles be part of any treaty to reduce superpower bombers, missiles and submarines. The third big item was the Soviet announcement that the controversial radar station in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> would be totally dismantled as had been demanded by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. While making this remarkable series of concessions, Soviet officials made it clear to their counterparts during their meetings in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is seeking a more stable international atmosphere while he wrestles with a troubled economy and ethnic unrest _ problems that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> described as awesome. For the American president, events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> represented `` the rise of freedom. ... Make no mistake. Nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march.'' He proclaimed that `` today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> opened its annual meeting on Monday facing political issues, Third World criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and attempts to expel <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from the 113-member organization. The issues have surfaced repeatedly at the agency's general conferences in recent years and figure on the current meeting's agenda as `` Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat'' and `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> nuclear capabilities. In his opening address, director-general <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Blix </PERSON> said promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is hampered by excessive public concern about radiation from nuclear power stations. The head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, Secretary of Energy <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, warned that regaining public confidence in nuclear power could not be achieved solely by promoting new designs and promising enhanced safety. `` I am absolutely convinced that the key ... is a positive track record of operational safety,'' by the owners and operators of nuclear facilities, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. Last year, the agency's annual conference adopted a resolution sponsored by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear policies. The resolution denounced `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to renounce the possession of nuclear weapons'' and demanded that it place its nuclear facilities under agency control. The conference also will discuss a resolution supported by African nations to suspend <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s membership rights. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has not sent a delegation to the general conference since 1979 when its credentials were not accepted for the meeting. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refusal to submit its nuclear facilities to international inspection and refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has prompted repeated calls from developing countries for its ouster. Under the 1969 treaty, which has been signed by 140 governments, countries pledge to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes and open their nuclear facilities to inspection by experts of the Vienna-based energy agency. Two known atomic powers, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, have not signed the treaty although they submit their peaceful nuclear facilities to international inspection. Some countries thought to possess the potential of producing nuclear weapons, including <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have also not signed the treaty. <PERSON> Blix </PERSON> said the agency recently received a Soviet proposal on the establishment of a center for international reasearch at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, the site of a major nuclear power accident in 1986. A second Soviet proposal calls for an international project in waste disposal research at an undisclosed site in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The conference, which ends Friday, is scheduled to approve a $ 162.8 million budget and also will be asked to approve $ 45.5 million for voluntary contributions toward the agency's technological assistance program

<TEXT>
 A two-week stream of East Germans fleeing to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> surpassed 20,000 on Monday, and an additional 1,200 hopeful refugees waited in cramped West German Embassy compounds in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. East and West German officials spoke several times by telephone Monday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations, said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON>, a West German government spokesman. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a `` highly sensitive phase,'' <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> told reporters. In <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for the East German city of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> said he thinks changes are needed to stop East Germans from leaving their homeland. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said he agreed with a recent remark by retired East German intelligence chief <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> that the East German government must think over the causes of the East German exodus. `` On this point I am of the same opinion as my friend <PERSON> Mischa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said on the first day of a four-day visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, however, refused to say what kind of reforms are needed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` This is something we have to discuss at home, not here,'' he said. There have been growing signs of disunity within <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> over the need to adopt democratic reforms The aging leadership under party chief <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has resisted reforms. High-level East German Politburo members recently criticized <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> for his reform-minded views. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Minister for Inner-German Relations said it was up to East German leaders to undertake reforms that would give East Germans a reason to stay in their rigidly controlled homeland. `` This wave of migration is a clear signal for a change in the orthodox policies of the East German leadership,'' <PERSON> Dorothee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON> told reporters. `` The key for change in the precarious situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lies in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>.'' East Germans fleeing to the West say they left because they saw little chance <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders would soon adopt the kinds of reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. East Germans in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were allowed to leave their homeland when <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> opened its borders on Sept. 11. As of early Monday, 20,130 East Germans had fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the channel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was opened, West German border police said. The number of East Germans occupying West German embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, has nearly reached its saturation point, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government sources said. About 900 East Germans have sought refuge inside the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> compound and 300 at the embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the sources said. Their numbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week. West German news media speculate that a solution may be in the works, as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants the refugee crisis cleared up by Oct. 7, when the communist state will celebrate its 40th anniversary.

 Syrian gunners fired more than 80 shells into the Christian enclave Monday, violating a 2-day-old cease-fire that has drawn 1 million refugees back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. An Arab League mediator urged both sides to honor the truce. Police reported no casualties in the barrage that hit pine woods near the mountain towns of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Christian forces commanded by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not fire back. There was no official explanation for the Syrian bombardment of the thinly populated mountain slopes. But an informed Moslem source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was designed as `` a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> message to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> that the truce could fall apart if the Christian media do not stop their campaign against the Syrians.'' The Arab League envoy, <LOCATION> Lakhdar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Ibrahimi </LOCATION>, announced after a one-hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, that <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will meet in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Saturday to seek political reforms aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war. That marked a major advance in the efforts by the 22-member Arab League to bring <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s feuding factions together and create a formula aimed at reuniting the fragmented country. But the Syrian shelling was a graphic reminder that nothing is certain. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s plight on Syrian occupation as he inaugurated an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> summit Monday in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. Praising the peacemaking efforts of the three-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader said: `` We support the efforts of our brethren in the tripartite committee despite our conviction that the root of calamity and the gateway of evil in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> occupation of the country.'' The council groups <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. A Lebanese police spokesman said Syrian howitzer batteries hit the Christian area in a 45-minute barrage that ended at 7:45 a.m.. An additional four shells hit the woods at 3 p.m Some shells exploded within a mile of the hilltop Bustan Hotel where Ibrahimi is staying, a police spokesman said. The shelling was the first serious violation of the cease-fire since it took hold Saturday. It prompted <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> to urge `` all sides to abide by the cease-fire ... and to believe that there is a new chance for peace.'' The truce was called last week by a three-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee assigned to find a settlement to the civil war, in which more than 150,000 people have been killed. Many Lebanese, who have seen hundreds of truces collapse, remain skeptical of an overall settlement but welcome the current respite. Police said at least 1 million refugees who fled the ferocious artillery battles that began March 8 have returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The city has taken the brunt of the devastating shelling, forcing all but 150,000 of its 1.5 million people to flee. A Moslem woman, <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Makkouk </PERSON>, returned home to her third-floor apartment in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sunday with her husband, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> and their two children after four months living with relatives and friends in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of the capital. `` I was so happy to be back home,'' she said, even though all the apartment's windows had been blown out. `` I spent the whole night cleaning up.''

 A top adviser to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Monday that the superpowers have made good progess on a strategic arms control treaty but that much work remains. `` Both sides have the will, but it is another question how much time it will take,'' Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said in an interview at the opening of the Supreme Soviet legislature's fall session. `` There still is a lot of work ahead,'' he added. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, former Soviet military chief of staff and now an adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, praised a protocol to determine the size of chemical weapons stockpiles that was reached in two days of talks between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. He also praised the decision to hold a summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next year. But he said key questions remain before the two sides can reach a final agreement on a treaty to slash their store of long-range nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the Soviets have dropped their insistence that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agree to limits on space-based missile defense systems before a nuclear arms reduction treaty is signed. That has been a major roadblock in arms negotiations for several years. Among the unresolved questions are procedures for verifying compliance with cuts in bombers, missiles and submarines. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants the treaty completed by the summit meeting.

 Leftist guerrillas fired on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and killed a mayor, the 22nd murdered this year, in separate weekend attacks, police and embassy officials said Monday. Gunmen in a speeding car fired several shots at guards protecting the ambassador's residence in the pre-dawn hours Sunday, but no one was wounded, embassy spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. Police said it was unclear which of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s two guerrilla groups, the Mao-inspired Shining Path or the pro-Cuba <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, was responsible for the attack.

Both men belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> opposition coalition and were running for re-election in November's nationwide municipal elections.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Temporary Spending Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, facing spending bill gridlock in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, approved a measure Monday designed to keep government agencies in business when the new fiscal year begins in six days. The bill, backed by the leadership of both parties and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, would keep the government functioning through Oct. 25. The House was expected to approve it Tuesday and send it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation is needed because an assortment of disputes has kept <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from completing work on all but one of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday. Chief among the stand-offs is a partisan spat over how much money should be spent on anti-drug programs and how to pay for them. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finished work on the last of its money bills Aug. 4, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved just seven of its own. The two chambers need to agree on compromise versions of each measure before they can be offered to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. Asked how many spending bills he thought would be completed by Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., said, `` Talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> I ca n't tell you who a woman's going to marry or what the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s going to do. The emergency measure contains none of the controversial provisions many of the individual spending bills are laden with. For example, it does not include language barring cigarette smoking on airline flights, halting federal aid for `` obscene'' art or liberalizing abortion restrictions.

 Rest easy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>! <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherwise </PERSON>, prognosticator of the Old Farmer's Almanac, says it'll be a mild winter across most of the country. And <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION> can expect a white Christmas. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, who claims 80 percent accuracy in `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest continuously published periodical,'' says only the northern third of the country will have more snow than usual. The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac hits the newsstands and supermarkets this week with its familiar planting and tide tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100 ways how to avoid untimely death. -LRB- No. 49. Avoid combing hair in the dark; No. 77. Never whistle in a coal mine. -RRB- <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are `` based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.'' He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will be balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The summer of 1990, says <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, will be hot and dry in many areas east of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where 300,000 of the 4 million copies of the customary yellow-covered almanac will be sold, heavier than average snow is forecast from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> through the prairie provinces. `` The more serious the weather, the larger percentage we sell,'' says Executive Editor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` They count on us more in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.'' The Old Farmer's Almanac is the legal document for tides and sunrises and sunsets in most states. In addition to giving readers weather predictions, advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets of winning lotteries and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie, the almanac advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost the popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent. The almanac also predicts the return of 4-inch-wide neckties for men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette recorders. The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23 years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising purposes. The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience, its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.

 Women broke into <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' judicial ranks decades ago, but now they're finally getting into the picture with the commissioning of portraits of female judges for courthouse walls The recently unveiled oil painting of retired <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> marks a new trend among the traditional oils of black-garbed men that are a staple of courthouses across the state, women judges said. `` It's a symbol,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Vecchio </PERSON>, sitting in <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION>. `` It's so that other women can come in and see there are not only women on the bench, there are women on the wall.'' `` Change is slow, but it's there,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who recalls the lonely days when she and <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> were the only women on the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bench. The first woman appointed to <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, appears in a portrait in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, dedicated in 1971, three years after her death, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfanello </PERSON>, an administrative assistant to the chief justice. A check with various judicial offices Monday did not produce any sightings of other female portraits, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Portraits are not paid for by the state, but are generally commissioned by family, friends or the local bar associations, <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> said. More than half of the women judges now on the bench in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> were appointed in the last five years, bringing their total up to 12 percent of the judiciary. `` I think as we have more women judges there'll be more women's pictures, and as we have more women lawyers the profession becomes kinder to women,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who is still active in <LOCATION> Hampden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as a master in mediation sessions involving civil cases, said she was surprised to find that friends had banded together to commission the portrait, unveiled last week. `` I'm pleased, of course,'' she said. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> was appointed to <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 by then-Gov. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>. A recent study commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> examined how women are treated in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> courtrooms _ as judges, attorneys and defendants _ and found bias does exist, said <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Maged </PERSON>, executive director of the study panel. Courtroom comments reported by both male and female attorneys included the phrase `` counsel may be beautiful but she is entirely wrong,'' and female judges being addressed as `` dearie,'' <PERSON> Maged </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, women judges said they look forward to commemoration in oil. `` The fact that you looked around and you saw no portraits of female judges, that's a symptom of what's been going on in the courts. But things are beginning to change,'' <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Vecchio </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has tightened security standards since the December bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, but a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> investigation said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> does n't know if airlines are meeting the standards. In addition, an Israeli airline security expert who studied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> systems said American airline companies do `` very little well'' when it comes to protecting passengers from an attack such as the one that killed 270 people in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, Dec. 21. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, the details of which are being kept secret by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was summarized by Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., at a hearing of her House Government Operations subcommittee on government activities and transportation `` Overall, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found that despite additional security measures imposed following <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> can not assure itself that required security procedures are being properly carried out by the airlines at designated high-risk airports,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. She said security deficiencies found in recent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airline inspections showed breakdowns in the training of airline security personnel. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> believes these deficiencies occur largely because <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has not established minimum training standards needed to ensure that airline security personnel working at high-risk airports overseas are sufficiently trained,'' said the congresswoman. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is an investigative agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeffet </PERSON>, former director general of security for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee that training given security agents for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers `` is extremely low, insufficient and not effective.'' He said that because the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> leaves airlines responsible for their own security, the agency can avoid responsibility for failures. `` Virtually all American airlines hire security firms based solely on the lowest price,'' said <PERSON> Yeffet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Belger </PERSON>, associate administrator for aviation standards at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency needs to be more active in seeing that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards are being met by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers in foreign airports. `` We have put <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers in the posture of having to deal as a private organization with a foreign government to implement our government regulations,'' said <PERSON> Belger </PERSON>, who said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was in favor of increasing <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> activity abroad. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, director of civil aviation security at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency has increased its workforce and expanded its intelligence organization since the Pan Am explosion. `` Unfortunately, we build a 12-foot wall and the criminal finds a 13-foot ladder,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. Investigators found that the explosion was caused by plastic explosives planted in a cassette player. American security measures were compared repeatedly during the hearing to those used by <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said the level of Israeli government support for that airline is such that `` many would argue it is not a commercial airline.'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON>'s security procedures are labor intensive, using proportionately many more workers than any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. He said the airline is small compared to American carriers, which altogether transport 1.2 million people a day, many on about 1,800 international flights daily. `` It is n't practical to put that kind of manpower into the system and have the transportation system we have today,'' said <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> relies more on mechanical devices to detect security problems.

 Steel scaffolding being moved at a construction site touched a 69,000-volt line in a `` ball of fire'' Monday, electrocuting three workers and injuring three, two seriously. The six men were rolling the wheeled, 25-foot scaffolding at a building under construction at <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Target </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the general contractor. No one was on the scaffolding. It appeared that the men `` just did n't look up. They never knew what hit them,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the cable carried enough electricity to supply a small town. The line, about 30 feet from the new building, fed <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' steel plant and was one of two circuits serving an <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> brewery. The workers were moving scaffolding to another wall of the building where they were putting up aluminum siding. <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>, 24, a Target Construction employee, said he was one of several workers installing a roof on the building when the accident occurred. `` I saw a big spark, and we went to the edge to look over and saw them all lying on the ground,'' he said. `` We got off of there. We just started yelling for help.'' He said the victims still appeared to be in contact with the scaffolding, so he and the others did not try to move them. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, of a concrete company, said he was inside the building when he heard an explosion. He looked outside and saw `` a huge orange ball of fire shooting way up in the sky.'' <ORGANIZATION> Worthington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> was without power for about five hours and sent 200 employees home, said spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhl </PERSON>. One of the injured men underwent surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> with second - and third-degree burns over most of his body, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> The second was in critical condition at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Westerville </LOCATION>, and the third was in satisfactory condition at <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, officials said.

<TEXT>
 A special high court was chosen Monday to try former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on charges of instigating widespread illegal wiretapping while in office. He faces a minimum of five years in prison if convicted. Parliament speaker <PERSON> Athanassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsaldaris </PERSON> chose 12 judges by lot from a list of the nation's 48 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges and 43 <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> presidents. <PERSON> Tsaldaris </PERSON> then sent the case file to <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Yannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Grivas </PERSON>, who will preside over the tribunal. It is expected to convene in November. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted last Wednesday to try the 70-year-old <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on allegations he was behind the tapping of telephones of his political friends and foes from May 1987 to April 1989. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> boycotted the debate, sending instead a note saying he was being persecuted unjustly by his political rivals. <PERSON> Theofanis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tombras </PERSON>, former managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsimas </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, will appear in court with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on charges of having been accomplices. The debate followed a report by a parliamentary commission of inquiry recommending that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tombras </PERSON> and Tsimas be indicted. After eight years in power, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> lost elections last June that resulted in a hung <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party and the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress formed a governing alliance that pledged to carry out a cleansing of Greek political life before holding new elections by Nov. 5 On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will begin a two-day debate to decide whether <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and four of his former senior ministers will be indicted in connection with a $ 210 million <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> embezzlement scandal, which another parliamentary commission of inquiry has recommended. Parliament has already indicted former Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Athanassopoulos </PERSON>, who will stand trial before a special high court set up last month. He is accused of ordering a cover-up of a scandal in 1986 in which a state company sold the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> 9,000 tons of <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> corn, claiming it was Greek. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week ordered <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to pay $ 3.8 million in unpaid dues on the corn, court costs and interest. In <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, a government minister accused of criminal action while in office can be tried only by a special court after an investigating committee of deputies convinces <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> sufficient evidence exists for a trial. <PERSON> Grivas </PERSON> has 15 days after selection of the tribunal to appoint one court member as a special investigator to look further into the charges. The investigator then will have 30 days to present his findings, making mid-November a likely date for the trial. The indication was that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> could lead his socialist party into the next elections while under indictment.

<HEAD>Feud Escalates Over Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats and Republicans intensified their battle over a capital gains tax cut Monday with sharper rhetoric and new radio and television ads as they headed toward a showdown on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor this week. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, said Democrats opposing the capital gains tax cut were showing their true colors with their alternative plan, which would raise tax rates on the rich to restore deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts. `` It's clearly a reconfirmation that they want to raise taxes,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. `` One has to wonder, when they say it's limited to only 600,000 taxpayers, who will have their taxes raised ... who's going to believe they want to stop there? House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., countered angrily that <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s comments were `` stuff and nonsense. The Bush-backed plan to drop the maximum tax rate on capital gains from 33 percent to 19.6 percent was `` ill-timed, ill-considered and damaging ... helping only the richest of our citizens and unfair to the middle class,'' he said. `` If the president thinks a veto threat ... will provide that kind of a bill being sent to him, he is very wrong indeed,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> might vote on the issue as early as Wednesday. The exact timing was in doubt Monday as the Democratic leadership wrestled with when to debate it and other controversial items attached to a giant budget bill, such as child care and Medicare catastrophic illness insurance. Both sides said they expected a close vote, and to tip the balance they both launched advertising campaigns. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to raid the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> by reducing capital gains taxes for the superrich and he wants working Americans to pay for it,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> television ad taped Monday A House GOP-sponsored commercial features an American flag flying against those of other industrial nations. The comparatively high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capital gains tax `` hurts small businesses trying to expand, families investing to send kids to college, senior citizens preparing for retirement,'' it contends. A radio spot sponsored by organized labor emphasizes that the nation's wealthiest people get the lion's share of the benefits from cutting capital gains taxes, which are levied on profits from stocks and bonds, real estate and sales of other assets. `` Oh, they'll trot out the old malarkey about how cutting taxes for rich people spurs economic growth,'' but `` there's not a bit of evidence to back it up,'' the ad says. Asked by reporters about statistics that show upper-income people benefit disproportionately from capital gains tax cuts, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, `` It's off the point. The issue is what's the effect on long-term growth and productivity.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> also repeated the Republican contention that Democrats, by opposing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s will, would be to blame if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president ca n't agree on a deficit-reduction package this fall. He said it was a `` kamikaze approach to national politics'' aimed at forcing a tax increase. The Gramm-Rudman law requires across-the-board spending cuts on Oct. 15 unless the projected fiscal 1990 deficit is brought to below $ 110 billion by then. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s suggestion was `` unworthy of him.'' `` We are not trying to create some kind of a political combat. We are trying to offer a proposal we think is good for the country's economic future,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> tried to play down the long-term political consequences of the battle. `` The partisanship should be confined to this one issue so we do n't have adverse spillover effects elsewhere,'' said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. He said he still hopes to strike a long-term deficit reduction pact with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> tried to brush aside suggestions that the capital gains fight was the first big test of his leadership. `` We intend to be in responsibility for a long time to come,'' he said.

 Hair-trigger tempers are among the aftereffects of Hurricane Hugo around here. Lines are long, and there is no electricity to cook hot meals, run water heaters for hot showers or power televisions and lights. `` I think that you can look at the people and realize that all we need is a little spark,'' Patrolman <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. `` The people are short-tempered right now.'' A 7 p.m. curfew in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> forces residents to return to homes lit only with candles, flashlights and kerosene lamps. On Monday, a steady downpour and temperatures in the 60s added to the misery. At one point, people lined up for four hours to buy food. Outside a grocery store near one of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s poorer neighborhoods, frustrations were as plain as damage from the storm. `` There's no bread. There's no meat,'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, 21, said. `` We ca n't survive like that.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> has been unable to get his paycheck from the restaurant where he works. Even if he could, all but a few banks remained closed Monday because of the lack of electricity. `` I'm frustrated, man,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, whose 2-year-old child was diagnosed with meningitis and hospitalized the day of the hurricane. On Saturday, a crowd of about 200 pushed, shoved and cursed as they waited for free ice, which was never distributed. Police called the incident a `` near riot,'' yet were not surprised it took place. `` People are getting a little testy after a few days, and it's understandable,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> On the Isle of Palms, across <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> harbor, police on Sunday punched and arrested a man who refused to heed orders to stay off the island. The island was off-limits until Monday under martial law while officials surveyed damage. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said calm will return once more utility services are restored, relief centers are opened and lines get shorter. `` An angry person is not necessarily a riotous person,'' he said. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he does not believe a riot will break out. `` It's not a concern in terms of something that I think is going to happen,'' he said. `` We have worked hard, our people know we're working with them ... so I do n't think it's going to create any problems. But <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said unless more relief comes soon, `` a lot of people's belongings are going to get took'' by looters `` The whole town's going to be called ` Hell Hole' soon. That's what it's going to be, one big hell hole Only the survivors like myself are going to dig ourselves out of it,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Others see no reason to get upset with inconveniences over which there is little control. `` I do n't think people need to get angry,'' said <PERSON> LeVerne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a hotel employee. Even so, <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s full impact is only now beginning to be felt. `` The first day after, people were kind of walking around in shock,'' he said. `` Then they were elated that they did n't suffer any more than they did. But now ... maybe the shock of the whole thing is just beginning to hit them _ that maybe they were n't that lucky.''

<HEAD>8,000 Demonstrate in Leipzig for More Democracy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 8,000 people marched through this East German city Monday, calling for more democracy in their communist homeland and singing `` We Shall Overcome,'' witnesses reported. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter at the scene and human rights activists said security forces arrested scores of people after the protesters blocked traffic in downtown <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. The demonstration came hours after communist authorities refused to register a pro-democracy opposition group called New Forum and told its members to cease all activities immediately. The <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> demonstration began after a religious service in the St. Nicholas church. The Monday evening services, known as `` peace prayers,'' have become a rallying point for dissidents and rights activists in recent months and frequently have been followed by demonstrations. Witnesses and rights activists said about 2,000 people attended the service, while another 2,000 gathered outside the church. The crowd then started marching toward downtown and <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s main train station About 4,000 people joined the march along the way and the crowd sang `` We Shall Overcome,'' and shouted slogans such as `` Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!'' witnesses said. Security forces cordoned off downtown and intervened to disperse the crowd when the protesters reached the main train station. It was not known if there were any injuries in the police action. The West German <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network said one of its camera crews was prevented by police from filming the demonstration. Earlier Monday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, two founding members of the Neues Forum, or New Forum, were called into the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and given a brief statement rejecting the group's application to be legalized. New Forum activists say the pro-democracy group has grown from 30 to more than 4,000 members nationwide in two weeks. It includes some of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most prominent artists, intellectuals, performers and other public figures. New Forum is urging democratic reforms in the rigidly controlled communist country. The group has held meetings with other informal opposition groups to coordinate their activities. More than 20,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its borders to East German citizens two weeks ago. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aging leadership has rejected the need for the kind of political and economic reforms sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jutta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON>, two New Forum members who signed the application for the group to be legalized, told reporters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> they were called to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and handed its decision. The ministry's brief statement said the group was `` socially unnecessary since there is no clear social interest'' for the group to exist, and told New Forum to cease all activities. Ms. <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement did not call New Forum an `` anti-state'' group. Thursday, the ministry accused the group of harboring `` anti-state policies.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has invited <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko for talks on faltering negotiations between the Soviet-backed Angolan government and the U.S.-backed rebels, officials said Monday <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, who will attend the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, has been asked to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the same time as <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the officials said. If <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> does not come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an official who spoke on condition of anonymity said talks with him would be held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, who has considerable prestige riding on the Angola-UNITA pact he sponsored, was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> three months ago. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is eager to have <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> meet to prevent the peace talks from derailing completely. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> served as the mediator for a June cease-fire, but the truce has shattered and subsequent talks failed. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> refused to attend the last negotiating session in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> on Sept. 18 despite urgings from Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who made a special trip to the region. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has considerable leverage with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> because most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms and other aid for the organization, estimated at between $ 40 million and $ 80 million, is funneled through <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. He appeared in recent weeks to be siding with Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to go into exile and integrate his troops with the Angolan army. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> denies he agreed to exile and says he will only surrender arms in return for a promise of free elections. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned that if the UNITA-Angola talks do n't resume soon <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> may disrupt the pullout of its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought an additional 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began June 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The sales were reported to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> by private exporters as required by law, but no further details were announced. The latest wheat sales boosted to more than 4 million tons the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has purchased for the 1989-90 season. Last year's sales totaled 8.1 million tons, making <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the leading foreign market for American wheat farmers. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 300,000 tons of wheat would be about 11 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have averaged around $ 3.65 per bushel nationally, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> recent five-day market estimates. That would make the sale worth about $ 40 million.

<HEAD>Leader of Miskito Indians Says He Will Return to Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The leader of the Miskito Indian resistance to the Sandinista government said Monday he will return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to discuss turning in his weapons and forming a political party to take part in February's elections. `` The war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government is paralyzed because of the peace accords,'' <PERSON> Wycliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, leader of about 3,500 guerrillas, said at a news conference. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> was referring to accords signed Aug. 7 by five Central American presidents that call for disbanding U.S.-supported rebels that have been trying to topple <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in return for a Sandinista guarantee of fair elections. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> heads a directorate that controls the Miskito anti-Sandinista movement, which has operated independently from the main Contra resistance. The Miskitos, other Indians and blacks of West Indian descent make up the majority of the population in the sparsely populated eastern two-thirds of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In some areas along its <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, English is spoken. The Miskitos have spearheaded the resistance in eastern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, operating from bases in remote northeastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. `` We Indians have always been discriminated against in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That's why we've had to fight all our lives, including in the war, to make ourselves part of that society,'' <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said. Even so, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said, his group, called YATAMA after the Miskito words for Sons of <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, decided to explore repatriation because of the stalled war. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said resistance leaders <PERSON> Brooklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagoth </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> will join him on a trip to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> beginning later this week. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said his group will meet with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, discuss the repatriation of 9,000 refugees living in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and visit Indians living in eastern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas have recently made conciliatory moves toward the Indians, making sure that a Miskito was given a chance to speak at their convention Sunday that nominated <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as the Sandinista presidential candidate in the Feb. 25 elections. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> YATAMA </ORGANIZATION> has 3,500 guerrillas, 1,000 inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and 2,500 on the Honduran frontier. The northeastern frontier between the two countries has always been more porous than other parts of the border because of heavy jungle and thin population. Fighting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has decreased sharply since February 1988, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cut off military aid to the mainline Contra resistance and the Indian fighters. Both groups continue to receive non-lethal aid. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> YATAMA </ORGANIZATION> fighters _ including members of the Miskito, <ORGANIZATION> Sumo </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> tribes as well as Nicaraguan blacks _ are prepared to turn in their arms by Dec. 8, when the peace accord calls for demobilization of armed rebels. `` We intend to create a political party in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that will be called <ORGANIZATION> YATAMA </ORGANIZATION> to participate in next year's vote. Even so, the situation is difficult because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have said all parties must be organized by the end of this month,'' <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the directors' trip back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was authorized by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> at the request of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> last week and who serve as an election observer. `` Our commission will hold talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, study the Nicaraguan political situation and see if it is possible for our refugees and exiles to return to the country,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 20,000 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> teachers boycotted classrooms Monday in a one-day strike to protest what they claim is chronic underfunding of one of the nation's most crowded public school systems. The strike, called after the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last week approved a $ 38.4 million tax cut but no new money for education, canceled classes for about 450,000 students. The walkout began with a wildcat strike Friday in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> areas. Because the teachers union did not announce the statewide walkout until Saturday, districts could not get enough substitutes, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, superintendent of public instruction. `` We're saying there are real critical needs in reducing class size, more textbooks, teacher salaries and in the area of personnel like counselors, librarians, those kinds of special people,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, president of the teachers union, which represents up to 90 percent of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s teachers. With a population of 1.7 million, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has the largest average household size at 3.17, compared to the national average of 2.62. Nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which encourages big families, and the state has the nation's highest percentage of school-age children, or 37 percent under 18. With a student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> also has the most crowded classrooms, and at $ 22,621 a year its teacher salaries are smaller than in 43 other states. The state ranks 50th in average annual expenditure per student of $ 2,326. Teachers long have complained they have 40 or more students in some classrooms and do n't have enought textbooks and other supplies. Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> acknowledged `` serious problems'' but said the teachers should have waited for the regular January legislative session to press their demands. The governor said the state may have a surplus of $ 185 million by the end of the fiscal year in June. More than 100 students crowded into a conference room Monday at the Capitol for a discussion with <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, who was asked why he would n't veto the tax cut. `` I wanted the tax cut,'' the governor said. `` You have to remember I was the one who raised taxes two years ago.'' Only two districts, both in the sparsely populated northeastern corner of the state, were open Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said.

 With the education summit at hand, eight business groups called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors Monday to dedicate as much energy and resources to schools as has been committed to the war on drugs. `` The strength of the American economy rests on the strength of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s public schools,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>, referring to statistics showing dismal academic achievement by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students, said `` All sectors share a responsibility for the current crisis'' and stressed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` must show leadership'' by making `` the improvement of public education a national priority on a level similar to his war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, announced the formation of a special coalition and outlined an agenda for action that coalition members said is necessary if education reform is to become a reality. The `` <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, co-chaired by <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>, also will include The Business Roundtable, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Under the proposed six-point agenda, the coalition said, `` We must define the goals of education, set the standards for attainment, and develop better ways of measuring achievement and assigning accountability for students, teachers and administrators.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> already have agreed to focus the two-day summit at <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on creating a process for developing national performance goals. The coalition agenda also called for creating a new professionalism for teachers and administrators, investing in early prevention and intervention strategies to help disadvantaged children become ready for school, supporting more equitable financing of education within states, linking the resources of higher education into the reform effort and restructuring the school systems. The group called on the president to select as soon as possible members for a presidential education policy advisory committee. <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> said the coalition will work with the governors on a national and state-by-state basis, and with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and appropriate agencies to begin to initiate new policies, practices and strategies that enable systemic change. `` We will encourage business leaders to becoming more involved at state and local levels, not in ` feel-good' endeavors, but those directed at systemic change,'' said <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>. `` We will increase business' understanding about education restructuring issues and serve as a resource for others who want to be involved.''

 Among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals that Soviet Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will carry back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is one to open large areas of both countries that have been closed to citizens of the other, an administration official said Monday. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> advanced the `` open lands'' proposal in talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> last weekend in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, but the positive Soviet response was lost amid several surprise developments to speed conclusion of major arms control treaties. `` We believe that we should move toward a situation of open seas and oceans, open lands and open space,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told a news conference Saturday. `` Transparency here, glasnost here, should not be selective or limited. It should apply everywhere,'' the Soviet foreign minister said. The Soviets did not respond immediately to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal `` because, frankly, there were bigger fish to fry,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be further identified. But the Soviets told the Americans `` they were going to take a look at it.'' The two sides have already made steps toward lifting travel restrictions that were first imposed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1941, while that country was fighting invading Germans. In 1955, during the Cold War, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> introduced reciprocal restrictions of its own, closing about half of the country to Soviet diplomats, journalists and academics. Those restrictions were eased slightly with the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accord in 1976, but Soviets and Americans living in each others' countries must still follow elaborate notification procedures if they wish to travel. Many areas remain closed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said that recently `` there have been some problems, but otherwise it is easier. There has been an opening up.'' A written department statement said `` it has always been <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy that both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> should reciprocally abolish ` closed areas.''' `` As a result of glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB- and perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB-, academic, scientific and commerical interchange and people-to-people contact between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have witnessed unparalled growth,'' it said. `` Yet, outmoded internal travel restrictions continue to make it difficult for diplomats and journalists to do their jobs, academics to do research and families to visit relatives,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal calls for abolition of areas that have been closed for security reasons, but would leave some sensitive bases off-limits. It calls for simplifying the system of notification, but would ensure that officials continue to book travel and accomodations through the existing agencies, the Soviet Directorate of the <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Office of Foreign Missions.

 A propane truck became wedged under a bridge and sprang a leak Monday, cutting off residents at one end of <LOCATION> Aquidneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> from the mainland for more than seven hours. No one was injured and no fire or explosion occurred in the accident, which took place about 9 a.m. Houses within a quarter-mile were evacuated to community centers at the north end of the island and police stood ready to lead residents of the area's 600 homes on foot across a golf course _ the only escape route _ if necessary. Electricity in the area was shut off to prevent an explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> closed airspace above the accident to a height of 3,000 feet, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> blocked boat traffic nearby. Access and electricity were restored to the northern tip of <LOCATION> Aquidneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shortly after 4 p.m., after the truck had leaked the last of its volatile cargo and was removed. The accident cut off the only two roads in and out of the north end of the <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, which is about 15 miles long. A bridge links <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, a town of 15,000, to the mainland. A woman who identified herself only as <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> pushed her year-old daughter in a stroller from their home across the golf course, a 1 -LCB- - mile trek `` I do n't want to be stuck there and I felt threatened,'' she said. Police Chief Madison <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said three safety valves protruding from the truck tore off when the vehicle failed to clear a 9-foot-5 railroad underpass by about 6 inches. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said authorities had to let the 1,900 gallons of propane in the truck vaporize and dissipate because there was no way to stop the leak and attempts to pump the cargo into another truck were were unsuccessful. `` You've got a lot of gas. You ca n't move the truck. It's a very dangerous situation,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said early in the day. He said authorities tried letting the air out of the truck's tires to remove the vehicle, but the springs kept it wedged up against the bridge. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, Northeast general manager for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the truck, said the truck was not likely to explode because the gas was venting through a roof valve and not concentrating near the ground. `` If it were to ignite, it probably would be just like a large torch, a flare,'' he said. Police said they did not know why the truck driver had chosen to go under the bridge rather than use an adjacent road that crosses the tracks. No charges were filed. Some 80 golfers were evacuated from the country club. Golf pro <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Diemoz </PERSON> said he drove the course in a golf cart to round up the players.

 Officials handed out $ 300 emergency checks Monday to islanders who lost their homes in Hurricane Hugo, which caused an estimated $ 1 billion damage to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Much of this island and its neighbors in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> remained without water and electricity Monday, one week after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and its 125-mph winds whipped through the region. Relief from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands that escaped <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s destruction has poured into <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, which Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said sustained $ 1 billion in damage and caused the deaths of seven people on the island. Earlier reports had put the dead at six. The federal government, working with Puerto Rican officials, began distributing the $ 300 emergency checks to families without homes. By Monday, 7,000 checks had been approved, but officials were uncertain how many people would eventually receive them. The governor met with school superintendents and asked them to take a census of the number of families without homes. Various government estimates range from 25,000 to 53,000 of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s 750,000 families are homeless <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, said the maximum aid to a single family is $ 10,000 if its property is in a disaster zone. The capital, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, and other communities on the eastern side of this island were declared disaster areas. The Puerto Rico water company estimated 800,000 of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s 3.3 million people were still without water service Monday <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, executive director of the company, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> should be receiving water by Tuesday. Meanwhile, people were taking water from swimming pools, bathing at fire hydrants or in the sea, and filling buckets at portable tanks distributed throughout the city. Two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyers, each carrying 10,000 gallons of fresh water, distributed water at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> harbor. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> reported it had restored power to 70 percent of the island, although much of the capital remained without electricity. On the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, the government reported $ 90 million in damages and 420 people homeless out of a total population of 85,000. A government emergency committee said much of the country was left without power, water and telephone service, but public utilities should be restored by the weekend. Only one death was confirmed, a 74-year-old woman who ran from her home seeking shelter during the hurricane. Earlier, two people were reported to have died. A total of 33 to 35 people were reported killed by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, which swept through Sept. 17-18. Aid and relief personnel were arriving from <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> neighbors that escaped the storm, including <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. Much of the relief was for the British colony of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, where 10 people were killed, 30 percent of the homes destroyed and damages of $ 100 million were incurred. In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reported a storage tank at the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> was still leaking at a rate of 42,000 gallons a day. They said the tank, damaged by the storm, still contained 1.25 million gallons, but that the oil was no longer seeping into the harbor. The Guard also said 40,000 gallons that did reach the harbor had been confined in containment booms.

<HEAD>Art Gallery Trustees Want Controversy Over Exhibit's Cancellation

<TEXT>
 Trustees of the embattled Corcoran Gallery of Art reaffirmed support Monday for director <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> and ordered a study of ways to resolve a controversy over her cancellation of an exhibit that included sexually explicit photographs. The 120-year-old gallery, the oldest art museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has been the target of severe criticism since mid-June when Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> canceled an exhibition of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> photographs. The cancellation was made with the consent of the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s board of trustees. The traveling exhibit, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, contained sexually explicit and homoerotic photographs and pictures of nude children, which drew protests from Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and other conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At a regularly scheduled meeting Monday, the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> board agreed to appoint a special panel of trustees to examine the three-month controversy and recommend steps to defuse it. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> said the panel would study `` concerns of the museum'' such as `` the status of the director, staff morale and future curatorial decisions.'' There have been persistent rumors that Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> might be fired. But board president <PERSON> Freeborn </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said after Monday's meeting `` there was substantial and widespread support for the director among the trustees. A representative of the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> staff asked Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> on Friday to resign, but she refused. Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> has said consistently that the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> show was canceled in the hope of preventing the Corcoran from becoming involved in a congressional dispute over the grant-making policies of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which had partially financed the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> show's national tour. But as the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> noted last week, in a statement issued by Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON> and the board's executive committee: `` The Corcoran Gallery of Art, in attempting to defuse the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> funding controversy by removing itself from the political spotlight, has instead found itself in the center of controversy.'' The board and the director said the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> cancellation had `` inadvertently offended many members of the arts cmmunity, which we deeply regret.'' The statement added that the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s `` course in the future will be to support art, artists and artistic freedom of expression.'' The cancellation resulted in a firestorm of criticism against the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>, who joined the gallery 18 months ago from the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where she was chief curator and director of the art division. Artists protesting the cancellation as a violation of freedom of artistic expression withdrew plans for two exhibitions of contemporary art at the Corcoran, and a third exhibition is in doubt. Artist <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> announced he is withdrawing a $ 1.5 million bequest to the Corcoran from his will and instead will give the money to the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION>, another private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> art gallery. Low morale among <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> staff members worsened recently when <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, the museum's chief curator, announced her resignation effective in January. She had arranged for the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibit to be shown at the Corcoran after it appeared in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> without incident.

 Striking musicians said Monday they have rejected a `` final offer'' from five <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casino-hotels that want the right to replace live music in some shows with recordings. Several celebrities have refused to appear at the strike-bound hotels because of the dispute.

 Reconstruction of 54 war-damaged cities has been completed 13 months after the guns fell silent in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Work on 11 cities, including the major centers of <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>, a huge oil-refining complex, and <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s major port before the outbreak of the war in 1979, will be completed within two years, the agency added. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirzadeh </PERSON>, the vice president for executive affairs, as saying 77,927 urban and rural houses and business premises damaged in the eight-year war were rebuilt or repaired this year. Work on 50,000 more will be completed by the end of the year, he added. Reconstruction started soon after a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire took effect in August 1988. Final costs are estimated at $ 400 billion. Foreign correspondents who visited <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s western border provinces a few months after the cease-fire, where many cities were flattened or heavily damaged, reported the entire region looked like a construction project. An estimated 1 million Iranians were displaced during the war. Many of them started returning to their cities as soon as the fighting ceased to join in the reconstruction.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is not prepared to move toward normal relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, despite the apparent completion of that country's troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. The officials said the administration would have been prepared to move toward that goal if there had been an agreement on a comprehensive settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. They blamed `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s intransigence'' for the failure of the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> peace conference this past July in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to reach a settlement on new political arrangements for that country once <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s withdrawal was complete. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said the last of its remaining 26,000 troops were to have been out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Tuesday. `` We believe normalization with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> would be premature,'' said one official, asking not to be identified. `` We hope that if we and other countries continue to minimize diplomatic and economic ties with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> will take a more cooperative approach toward a comprehensive Cambodian settlement,'' the official said. The Vietnamese withdrawal leaves in place the Hanoi-backed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, which failed in an effort to reach a power sharing arrangement with three other Cambodian factions. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has come under strong criticism from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere over its <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> policy on grounds that the existing government <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> alone has the strength to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from retaking power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful of the factions contending for power, are widely blamed for the murders of at least 1 million Cambodians during their 3 -LCB- year rule between 1975-78. Asked about the prospect of a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Monday this issue can best be dealt with through a process of negotiation and a comprehensive political solution. `` Only such a solution can have the guarantees and the interational peacekeeping force under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> which will minimize the danger of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Successive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents dating back to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> have linked the normalization of relations with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy also has taken into account <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s attitude on providing information on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen still missing from the Indochina War <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is one of a handful of countries with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no diplomatic or trade relations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never recognized the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government since what was then <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> became independent in 1954. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic presence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ended with the North Vietnamese conquest of that country in 1975.

<TEXT>
 House members expressed willingness Monday to give up free newsletter mailings to constituents and use the $ 45 million savings to treat pregnant women addicted to drugs. `` We really created a Frankenstein,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass. `` The only way we're going to free ourselves from this monster is to cut its head off ... and use it for something worthwhile.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who argued against the ban during floor debate, was critical of the action `` It's pure demagogy, but it's great politics,'' he said. The 245-137 non-binding vote did n't ban the mailings, but instructed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees to support the prohibition as part of a $ 1.95 billion money bill to run <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. `` This was not a vote to instruct the conferees so much as it was a vote to ... pose for holy pictures,'' said <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on legislative appropriations. <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> predicted a compromise would be reached because members want to `` save their newsletter programs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 83-8 on Sept. 7 for the same ban, approving an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. `` Anyone who has read a congressional newsletter will understand immediately we are not asking for the sacrifice of great intellectual or informational exchange,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., arguing for the Newsletters, she said, often are a `` taxpayer-funded political advertisement for sitting members.'' `` Are you willing to give up a congressional perk to combat drug addiction in newborn babies?'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> asked in his motion to instruct conferees. `` The frank has been abused.'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said that in fiscal 1988, which ended about a month before congressional elections, the cost of newsletters rose steadily as the election approached _ from $ 5.9 million the first quarter to $ 16 million the last quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> mass mailings started at $ 3.8 million the first quarter and rose to $ 10 million in the fourth quarter. Supporters of the ban said more than 1,000 babies are born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each day with substance abuse symptons. They said the savings from the newsletter ban would permit a 10-fold increase in the pregnant addict programs.

 An accused drug trafficker arrested in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is wanted on federal charges of running an operation that shipped tons of the illegal drug methaqualone to this country, officials said Monday. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez-Zapata </PERSON> was arrested over the weekend by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said that if the department confirms his identity, it would likely seek the extradition of Gomez-Zapata, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1984. Drug Enforcement Adminstration spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> authorities had, indeed, confirmed through fingerprints that the suspect in custody is Gomez-Zapata. The indictment charges that <PERSON> Gomez-Zapata </PERSON> masterminded a drug ring that shipped tons of methaqualone from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where it was then transported illegally into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug is also known as Quaaludes, a hypnotic depressant that was believed by users to enhance sexual pleasure. The indictment was one of four returned by a federal grand jury as a result of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Operation Hammerhead,'' which the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said identified 24 shipments of methaqualone pills and powder totalling 54 tons of illegal drugs bound for this country. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents seized 6 -LCB- tons of methaqualone powder in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, six tons in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and nine tons of methaqualone tablets in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, according to a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> news release on the case. At the time, the department said the investigation had focused on the Gomez-Zapata family of <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The indictment charged that some of the defendants conspired to obtain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment and chemicals to set up a methaqualone laboratory to make tablets for distribution in this country. <PERSON> Gomez-Zapata </PERSON>'s two brothers, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez-Zapata </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez-Zapata </PERSON> were also charged and are fugitives.

One of the charges against <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez-Zapata </PERSON>, continuing criminal enterprise, carries a sentence of 10 years up to life. The indictment also alleges that other shipments of the drug, disguised as harmless chemicals, were sent through the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

 King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> pledged an unwavering war on terrorists Monday, stressing his government's resolve to behead whoever tries to undermine security in the holy places of Islam. His warning came at a Cabinet meeting, according to a statement by Information Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shaer </PERSON> that was distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, the radical speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, on Monday reiterated his call for retribution against <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for last week's beheading of 16 Kuwati Shiite Moslems convicted of planting bombs in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. The July 10 bombings came at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage season in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, killing one pilgrim and wounding 16. The doomed <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON> said in a recorded confession broadcast last week on Saudi television that they received sabotage training from Iranians in a remote area of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. They said two Iranians at the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> provided them with explosives and timing devices. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied it. On Monday, <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> said, `` The kingdom will not retreat as much as a hair's breadth from exacting Hodood -LRB- God's punishment -RRB- ... on whoever tries to tamper with the sanctity of the Islam's holiest shrines or tries to undermine security in the country. `` We will accept no blame in our quest to uphold justice. We will not heed the false propaganda campaigns,'' he said, referring to anti-Saudi pronouncements from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is governed by <ORGANIZATION> Sharia </ORGANIZATION>, Koranic law that prescribes beheading for convicted murderers, saboteurs and whoever desecrates holy shrines. The punishments are known as Hodood, which also sentences adulterers to death by stoning and thieves to having a hand cut off. Saudi authorities said the bombs in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> were planted by a group identified as Kuwaiti nationals, most of them of Iranian extraction. Sixteen were executed in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on Thursday, four sentenced to jail and nine acquitted. <PERSON> Al-Shaer </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> as noting that executive authorities do not influence the Islamic courts, which handed down the death sentences, but `` is limited to carrying out'' such sentences. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> must expect `` vengeance'' for beheading the 16. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, groups of Shiites tried to demonstrate in front of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> but were dispersed by police. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said that in a statement released Monday, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> said a mourning ceremony will be held Thursday for the `` Kuwaiti martyrs'' at the shrine of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. He told the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that `` revolutionary Moslems will deliver the appropriate response for this crime,'' the radio said. The executions have become a cause celebre for Iranian radicals who oppose normal ties between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. Iranian pragmatists, led by the newly elected President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, had been moving to ease a Tehran-Riyadh rift dating from July 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians, were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Monday it will slash military spending by more than 8 percent and cut its huge deficit in half in a 1990 `` crisis'' budget made necessary by the nation's poor fiscal health Finance Minister <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> used that wording as he unveiled the proposed budget on opening day of the Supreme Soviet legislature's fall session. The session's sweeping two-month agenda of about 80 bills includes proposals to radically alter some traditional ways of doing things in Soviet politics. Under dire need for more revenues and less expenses, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plans to implement a progressive income tax for Soviets earning 700 rubles -LRB- $ 1,076 -RRB- or more a month _ more than three times the average wage _ and float a $ 92 billion bond issue, the nation's first, to help finance new construction, <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> told lawmakers. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presided over the 542-member Supreme Soviet, which reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and discontent caused by the often conflicting demands of the country's more than 100 ethnic groups and the state economy's failure to meet many basic needs Many people were looking to the 4-month-old legislature for solutions. It was given expanded powers and a full-time political role by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for `` democratization.'' The legislators met in a hall at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and heard government officials give a bleak assessment of recent economic performance. Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> told them, `` The dynamism of the economy this year has been steadily falling in many major areas, social tension has increased and the national economy has been losing its balance. `` Against the background of these trends, deficits on the consumer market and in production have grown.'' Trying to parry shortages of goods ranging from tea and meat to salt and matches, the government plan for 1990 calls for a 20 percent increase in factory-made consumer goods, <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> said, with the total produced by converted defense plants growing by almost 35 percent to $ 61 billion. According to <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON>, the government of Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> plans to raise $ 83 billion in new revenues and trim expenditures by $ 10.3 billion to cut by half the 1989 government budget deficit of $ 192 billion next year. The resulting budget, including $ 750 billion in expenditures, `` is intended to overcome the crisis situation in finance,'' <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said. The Soviets can not expect any help from foreign trade, he added. Projected revenues in 1990 will decline by $ 3.9 billion from this year. If no increase occurs in the selling price of oil and gas, the Soviets' top exports, all the revenue they generate abroad will go to pay off existing foreign debt, he said. He said the proposed 1990 budget is designed to shore up the ruble and improve the inadequate social safety net now offered most Soviets. Pensions for 60 million retirees will be increased by an average of 15 percent, <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said, but not enough rubles are available to go to all who deserve them. Pensions are often woefully low. Cooperatives, whose output of goods and services is estimated to reach $ 46 billion next year, will pay about $ 2.3 billion in taxes. The plan to cut military spending from $ 119 billion to $ 109 billion, or by 8.3 percent, is in keeping with a directive from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies to reduce defense spending by 14 percent by 1991, <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said. The 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's new parliament, elected the membership of the Supreme Soviet from among its own ranks this summer. Military research will be cut by $ 3.4 billion next year, <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said. He credited the Kremlin's `` realistic and constructive foreign policy'' for the easing of world tensions that made defense cuts possible. Many Western observers are wary of how the Soviets calculate their defense expenditures, saying <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> bureaucrats can arbitrarily raise or lower their prices. Likewise, Soviet officials last year presented a government budget with a $ 58 billion deficit, but much of the shortfall was hidden with accounting tricks. Later estimates put it more than three times higher. The 1989 Soviet deficit _ officially said at one point to equal $ 192 billion _ was more than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's deficit for fiscal 1989 of $ 161 billion, and relatively more serious because the Soviet economy is much smaller than the American. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's fiscal 1989 federal budget is $ 1.1 trillion. In other business, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet the Moscow-based government will take firm steps to settle the dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> can not end their feud quickly. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pushed the Supreme Soviet session to get down to work immediately on the budget and not get bogged down in wrangling on procedure. However, it took nearly an hour of debate before deputies agreed to use a new electronic vote-tallying system rather than the traditional raised hands way of counting votes. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> laughed, and told lawmakers to go back to `` tried and true weapons.'' Like decades of Soviet legislators before them, they raised their Supreme Soviet identification cards for a count.

 Government troops killed two Sinhalese radicals and arrested 85 in a new crackdown, but officials appealed Monday for other militants to surrender during a three-day cease-fire later this week. Other ethnic clashes reportedly left four people dead. A government statement said the two radicals were killed and the 85 others arrested during search operations. It did not say exactly when the operations were mounted. It said such activities would be suspended for three days beginning Wednesday as part of a government effort to restore peace to this nation torn by ethnic strife. The government has offered $ 512 to each Sinhalese radical who surrenders with his weapon during the three days. There has been no response from Sinhalese extremists to the government's offer. The Sinhalese government Monday distributed leaflets written in Sinhalese saying, `` You are fighting a futile war in which many of your colleagues have died and more more wounded.'' Two Sinhalese brothers were also killed by the radicals in central <LOCATION> Nuwara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eliya </LOCATION> district. Sinhalese radicals of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> started their violent campaign against the government after it signed a peace accord with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in July 1987 to end a Tamil insurrection for a separate homeland in the northeast. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> deployed its troops to enforce the agreement, but the leading Tamil group turned its guns on them. In the north Monday, Indian troops shot and killed a Tamil rebel after an Indian patrol was attacked at <LOCATION> Pandatharippu </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION>, about 190 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, an Indian diplomatic spokesman said. It was the first death involving Indian troops since since 42,000 Indian peacekeeping troops suspended military offensives against the rebels on Wednesday. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw its troops by Dec. 31. The Indian spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said a Tamil civilian was killed by suspected Tamil rebels in the <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> area. However, Tamil residents contacted by phone in <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> said the victim, a Tamil student and postman, were killed when Indian troops fired on a group of rebels pasting posters to commemorate the death anniversary of a colleague. Sinhalese militants have objected to the presence of the Indians troops, who they accuse of violating this country's sovereignty. They also said the government has provided too many concessions to the Tamils in an effort to end the minority uprising. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, and Sinhalese about 75 percent. At least 5,000 people have died in the Sinhalese radicals' campaign Another 11,000 people have been killed since the Tamil ethnic war started in 1983.

 The government is asking Poles for a loan, issuing <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills for the first time since World War II. However, the soaring inflation led the pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> to advise readers that while the bonds may be considered a way to support the new non-communist-led government, it was not considered a savings investment. The government hopes to raise $ 289 million in the sale, which is to begin Oct. 2. The bonds, paying an annual interest rate of about 86 percent, are redeemable within six months. Polish banks pay about half that much in annual interest. Inflation last month however hit 50 percent after government food price controls were lifted.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his maiden presidential address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, offered measured praise for the organization that he had pilloried on the campaign trail last year. `` No, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is n't perfect. It's not a panacea for the world's problems,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the opening session of the 44th General Assembly `` But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus _ and it must remain a forum for peace.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador in 1971-73, said he has seen a shift in the international body. `` In recent years, certainly since my time here, the war of words that has often echoed in this chamber is giving way to a new mood. We've seen a welcome shift, from polemics to peacekeeping.'' The president closed with an appeal to `` bring a unity of purpose to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>'' to spread peace and freedom throughout the world. Last year, during his campaign against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took several rhetorical swipes at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and he accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of wanting to rely too much on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to resolve international crises. In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Aug. 18, 1988, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` sees <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as another pleasant country on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> roll call, somewhere between <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. I see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as the leader, a unique nation with a special role in the world.'' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` You've got to understand that it is only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world, and we ca n't turn it over to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or other multilateral organizations.'' He also said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> was `` torn by tensions'' and called it `` an unreal place where the <LOCATION> Maldive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> has the same votes as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In his 1987 autobiography, `` Looking Forward,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote: `` Like most Americans who had idealistic hopes for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> when it was created in 1945, I'd undergone a sea change in attitude by the early 1970s. As ` the last best hope for peace' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> was another light that failed.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that it `` still serves a valuable purpose. It may be largely ineffective _ and sometimes counterproductive _ in the political area. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace-keeping forces have performed well.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contributions in science, medicine, agriculture, space and humanitarian efforts `` have been indispensable.''

 <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> slapped a policeman in self-defense after he forcefully pulled her from her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>, a screenwriter testified Monday at the actress' trial. `` That man was after blood I think,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>, a free-lance writer who has written for television's `` Knots Landing'' and `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' `` He reached in with his left hand and grabbed Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s wrist With his other hand he opened the car door,'' <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> said in relating the profanity-laced June 14 encounter between Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> and Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` She was just as irate as he was. She was more frightened than anything else. He was really hot. She reached up and slapped him. He was more surprised than anything else,'' said <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>, who was called by the defense. <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> said he stopped his car when he noticed the unusual sight of a policeman pulling over a white <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corniche </ORGANIZATION>, and became concerned while he watched. `` The lady looked as if she was going to be threatened and as though she would be hurt,'' he said. After describing the brief altercation that ended with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s arrest, he said, `` I could n't understand that because she was half his size.'' Monday opened the third week of the misdemeanor trial before a <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that has cost taxpayers more than $ 22,000. Defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said new witnesses turned up during the weekend and the case would likely go until Friday. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer, driving with an expired license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. The day began with Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> bounding from her car to tell reporters about upsetting letters she received during the weekend regarding an earlier out-of-court remark that she was afraid of going to jail because there were lesbians in there. `` I have nothing against gays or lesbians. I have lots of gay boys working for me,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said. `` I got letter from the lesbians and gay association. They are going to boycott me because I said there are lesbians in jail. How do I know who's in jail? Imagine a women's jail. There must be lesbians ... Maybe I should become a lesbian. What do I know? I like men.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> claims she acted in self-defense because the officer cursed her and dragged her from her car after he spotted expired registration tags on the car. Prosecutors contend that after <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> stopped Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, she drove away while he was checking for other violations and that she slapped him when he pulled her over a second time.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers on Monday presented a key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman a plan they hope can break the impasse over legislation designed to begin protecting the northern spotted owl and allow continued logging in the region's old-growth forests While the lawmakers declined to discuss the plan in detail, they indicated it would require `` expedited'' court review of timber sales planned in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s federal forests and hinted it may include a slight drop in the sales level envisioned in earlier proposals. `` I'm not prepared to rush into anything,'' <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> interior appropriations subcommittee, said after an hour meeting with Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., both members of the Northwest lawmakers consider <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>' support essential if they are going to gain the support of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> now scheduled to meet Wednesday and avoid a fight on the House floor. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> is the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chairman of the conference committee and <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> are members. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> has been an outspoken critic of a Senate-passed plan that would prohibit federal courts from enjoining timber sales over the next year in forests known to contain spotted owls. `` I heard language that makes me hopeful we can come to an agreement,'' said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. He said he was not sure agreement could be reached before the meeting. Lawmakers were searching for a compromise that would assure Northwest mills of a stable supply of timber over the next 12 months while the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> decides whether the owl should be protected as a threatened species. Such a designation would require protection of its habitat, the old-growth forest. Environmentalists have launched an all-out lobbying campaign to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan, which they charge would severely restrict their access to the courts where they have won injunctions that at one point halted more than half of the timber sales planned in the region's federal forests this fiscal year. The timber industry supports the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan, but insists it will fail unless it includes restrictions on court appeals.

 Rock' n' roll and rap musicians rallied across the street from the White House on Monday to protest groups they say want to censor their music. `` I think the framers of our Constitution would not have wanted to create a constitutional revolution where you could n't rap and you could n't rock and you could n't roll,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> told about 200 people in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Attending the rally, held on the 200th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sending the Bill of Rights to the states for ratification, were <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> of the rap group <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DMC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of Living Colour. Statements from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> were read. The musicians' principal target was the Parents' Music Resource Center, a non-profit group that has been critical of what it considers violent and suggestive lyrics. Among leaders of the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based group are <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, wife of Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, wife of Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> `` They are never going to be happy until the only thing that they see or hear is the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that they wish were out there, the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that fits their cultural standards,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, executive director of the Parents' Music Resource Center, said Monday that her group does not advocate censorship. `` We do not support legislation and we do n't support restrictions on popular music of any kind,'' she said. `` We do support our voluntary agreement with the recording industry, which has been in effect since 1985. The individual record companies ... decide which albums are the ones that get the consumer information. We do n't play a role in that decision-making process.'' The consumer information can include lyrics printed on album covers so parents can decide if they find the music's message objectionable. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, master of ceremonies for the rally, said musicians should be able to `` sing about drugs and the gang culture and teen-age sexuality and a whole list of issues that need to be sung about and talked about.'' He said Music in Action, a group that opposes Mrs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s organization, had gathered 50,000 signatures protesting the activities of the parents' group `` When we first did our concerts and this woman <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ... said that it was our fault that people fight and do things like that because she did n't have anything better to say,'' said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, known professionally as Run. Living Colour's <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said the parents' group was involved in `` an attack on the creative impulse.'' `` Say somebody is writing a song that talks about sexual politics ... and in the course of that song they use profanity to express their anger about something,'' he said. `` If the censorship groups prevail, that artist will think twice about the kind of lyrics he is writing.''

<HEAD>SWAPO Violence Condemned but Understandable, Says Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Anglican church group that visited <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> said on Monday that violence within the groups fighting for the independence of that southern African country was deplorable but understandable. `` We are aware that there have been incidents of denial of human rights and the use of torture among and within groups struggling for liberation,'' said a statement from the group, headed by Archbishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, former primate of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. `` As church people we condemn such violations of human rights and the use of torture wherever it occurs. Where it has occurred it needs to be acknowledged and those responsible held accountable.'' Dissidents said security forces of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, tortured and killed fellow Africans who questioned or opposed the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leadership headed by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s group was in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> Sept. 10-22. It was sent by Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the Anglican leader. The Anglican Communion worldwide has 70 million members. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is to hold independence elections in November, supervised by the U.N. <ORGANIZATION> Transitional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s population is 1.5-1 .8 `` SWAPO terror is a substantial problem and it needs to be addressed,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, adding: `` War is a dirty business.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had reasons for its suspicion because it, he said, undoubtedly had been penetrated by South African spies. But he said the question could not be considered in isolation from `` apartheid and violence,'' which he said has characterized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and its rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is now known. The territory was a German colony from 1884 until it was taken over in 1915 by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said difficulties there rose essentially from `` 105 years of external control and the incredible brutality and illegal occupation by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>.'' He said he was `` cautiously optimistic'' that elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> would be free and fair and that a stable government would be established. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> reported to <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> at his Lambeth Palace residence in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday. Lutherans, Anglicans and Roman Catholics are the majority churches in <LOCATION> Nambia </LOCATION>. Among the members of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s group was H.K. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> layman and former vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

 A former official at the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty Monday to charges he provided falsified passports to foreigners in return for cash and sex. <ORGANIZATION> Southwark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> sentenced <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> to 21 months in jail. Witnesses told the court that <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>, 35, charged up to $ 24,000 for a passport normally available for $ 100, and he made $ 400,000 in six months. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, who was the chief passport officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to conspiring with other unidentified people to obtain false passports between January 1986 and May 1987. `` In return for thousands of pounds, he supplied passports to virtually anyone, no matter how bogus or sham their applications were,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevan </PERSON>. The official also demanded sexual favors from Moroccan prostitutes to whom he sold passports, the prosecutor said. He said the official was photographed in bed with two of them. In sentencing <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>, Judge <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Anwyl-Davies </PERSON> said the official had breached the trust of his employers. The judge ordered him to pay $ 5,680 in legal costs. Holding an Irish passport allowed McDonald's customers to stay in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for an unlimited time and easily visit other countries, said <PERSON> Bevan </PERSON>. He said Irish passports are granted legally to people with an Irish parent or grandparent or others who are married to an Irish citizen. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> put details from legitimate birth and marriage certificates on application forms and used them to issue the false passports, <PERSON> Bevan </PERSON> said. The scheme was exposed when a reporter from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weekly, sent a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman posing as the mistress of a wealthy businessman to see McDonald, accompanied by a woman reporter. Their conversation was secretly recorded. When the story was published, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. He was arrested in August 1988 and extradited to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for prosecution. The case also led to several trials last year of people described as McDonald's customers and agents. One of his operatives, French-born <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raud </PERSON>, said at one of the earlier trials that <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> supplied passports to people from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> who might have been terrorists.

 Police patrols were doubled by Monday in a drug-infested neighborhood where about a dozen off-duty soldiers and reputed crack dealers fought a 30-minute gun battle. Hundreds of rounds from handguns, shotguns and semiautomatic weapons were fired, witnesses said, but no one was hurt in Saturday night's shootout. Police arrived, took the soldiers' firearms and arrested two suspected dealers. The next day, scuffles broke out among a handful of supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and opponents, who said they were being falsely accused of selling drugs. No serious injuries were reported. The gunfight between the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> from nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> and 15 to 20 people police described as gang members happened outside a home owned by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>, a member of the special force. `` They shot at us, and we fired back,'' <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> said Monday, pointing across his front porch full of potted red geraniums and dozing cats at a reputed crack house across the street. <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>, 32, said the gang members had become upset earlier Saturday that he was videotaping their activities from his second-floor window. He said they threatened him and he called fellow Rangers for help. The soldiers, armed with semiautomatic weapons and shotguns, showed up at an anti-drug party <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> held in his backyard Saturday night, and soon the shootout erupted. Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fjetland </PERSON> said the incident could have been avoided had residents called police. But <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> said police are too slow to react, and must wait `` until shooting actually starts.'' Army officials said they would wait for completion of a <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action was warranted against the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. But Maj. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, second-in-command of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, said, `` From everything I am told by the city police, the Rangers were right. They were having a party, and they were attacked.'' Residents of the house denied Sunday that they fired any shots at the <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> house. They also denied participating in drug deals, although they said drug activity often occurs in front of the house, The Morning News Tribune of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> reported. <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> said he and his neighbors see drug deals at the house day and night. `` I bought this place two years ago for $ 10,000 after it was abandoned. We're fixing it up and as far as I'm concerned, I think this neighborhood is going to be restored to a decent place to live,'' he said. A neighbor, 16-year-old Candy <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said the arrival of crack cocaine dealers in the past two years has transformed the tree-lined, working-class street into a dangerous place to walk. `` Now, most people are scared to be outside,'' she said. Police said suspected Crips gang member <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, 20, was held for investigation of assault, and gang member <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, 21, was held for investigation of unlawful use of a weapon.

 Police said Monday they questioned eight Jewish settlers on suspicion of firebombing Israeli property and stoning settlers to stir up anti-Arab sentiment. In one instance, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said, settlers hurled a firebomb at an Israeli-owned car near <LOCATION> Ginot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shomron </LOCATION> settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in response, settlers from the Jewish enclave raided a nearby Arab village and vandalized property. No one was hurt. Northern district police spokesman <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbel </PERSON> said eight Israeli men and women settlers were detained Sunday and Monday. `` We have intelligence that the incidents in January and February in <PERSON> Ginot </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> were carried out by residents of Ariel,'' he said. The radio said some of those held belonged to a local committee of the far right, pro-settlement <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> party, which holds three seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, mayor of the 7,000-member settlement 23 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the allegations are `` a bit of a fantasy. I just ca n't believe it.'' Ariel earlier required <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers to wear tags identifying them as `` alien workers.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media also reported that Ariel settlers were leading vigilante groups in the northern part of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Masked assailants in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hacked to death a Palestinian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> worker they believed was cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. They said <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhsen </PERSON>, 38, was axed to death in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, where he worked as a secretary. He was the 120th Arab slain by fellow Palestinians since the 21-month-old uprising began, and the fifth killed in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> since last week. At least 574 Palestinians were killed by soldiers or Israeli civilians and 40 Israelis have died. Also in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Saed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> was severely beaten by masked assailants while traveling to a government job. Hospital officials reported he was critically injured. The army confirmed the slaying and beating. Nine Arabs were shot and wounded by soldiers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, including one Palestinian who tried to attack a soldier with an ax, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. One Palestinian was shot and wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army spokesman's office said it was looking into the incidents. Also Monday, the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> was re-opened in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after the Israeli military government invested $ 300,000 to renovate the building and buy new equipment.

In the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s coalition government easily defeated two motions of no confidence, one from <LOCATION> Tehiya </LOCATION> calling for a rejection of the Egyptian peace plan, the other from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> calling for the plan's adoption.

 Maroon, white and black ribbons were tied to the empty desks of 20 students killed in the state's worst bus accident as their classmates quietly returned to classes Monday. Only five students rode the route of Bus No. 6, which tumbled into a water-filled pit after colliding with a delivery truck Thursday on a two-lane road 15 miles from the Mexican border. Eighty students from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> were on the bus at the time of the accident, which the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is investigating. Of the 61 injured, six students and bus driver <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, 46, remained hospitalized Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Teachers hugged survivors who returned to classes. Mission Junior High Principal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbenante </PERSON> began the day with an emotional speech over the public address system. Abbenante read the names of 12 junior high students killed in the wreck and asked students and teachers to join hands while he prayed for the `` holy innocents'' who `` have a place reserved for them in heaven.'' A steady flow of students overwhelmed by emotion sought consolation at crisis centers set up for the school's 826 students. At the high school, counselors roamed the hallways and attended the victims' classes. `` It's calm here, but kind of a sad calm,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahan </PERSON>, a Baptist minister on hand for students with other clergy. Classes were canceled Friday in the school district. The soft-drink delivery truck ran a stop sign and plowed into the bus, causing it to fall into the 40-foot pit. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the driver of the truck, has told federal investigators his breaks failed, but the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has not identified a cause for the wreck. The school desks of the victims were adorned with ribbons of the school's maroon and white colors. A strip of black was added to signify mourning. During a seventh grade social studies class, <PERSON> Lupita </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 13, sat in front of the desk formerly occupied by her 12-year-old friend, <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, the class secretary who was buried Friday. `` I cried all weekend,'' <PERSON> Lupita </PERSON> said, but consoled herself with the idea that, `` They're not going to be in this life now with drugs and everything. They're with <PERSON> God </PERSON> now. They're safe.'' Her teacher, <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, introduced <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON>, a counselor from the nearby <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> school district. <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON> told students it was all right to think about their dead friends, talk about them and feel sad. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Granados </PERSON>, who was in the social studies class, escaped from the bus with only minor injuries. `` It's going to be hard, but we'll get over it,'' the 12-year-old said.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said Monday it has suspended its search for more bodies of the 171 people killed when a French DC-10 exploded over the <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> desert on Sept. 19. But investigators from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> still sought clues in debris scattered over a remote area more than five miles long and a mile wide. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paillasse </PERSON>, head of the investigation commission, told a French TV interviewer he was sure an `` explosive substance'' in a front cargo compartment caused the crash, but that it has not yet been positively identified as a bomb. <PERSON> Paillasse </PERSON> said laboratory tests on wreckage are proceeding in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to find out `` from the traces of combustion, which explosive material was involved.'' The plane exploded at an altitude of 30,000 feet about an hour after taking off from <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Wreckage of the UTA airline plane was scattered over the <LOCATION> Tenere </LOCATION> desert in neighboring <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, one of the most inaccessible spots on earth. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, judicial sources said Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruguieres </PERSON> officially asked <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s counterespionage police _ the <ORGANIZATION> Direction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territoire </ORGANIZATION>, or DST _ to aid in the probe. <PERSON> Bruguieres </PERSON>, an anti-terrorism specialist, heads the criminal investigation. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Various unidentified callers to news media in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> claimed responsibility for the crash, but none was verified. The calls included the previously unknown Secret Chadian Resistance and the Islamic Jihad, which is believed to hold Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to say precisely how many bodies had been recovered when he announced abandonment of the search on Monday. `` In the heat of the desert _ which averages ... -LRB- 122 degrees -RRB- _ it is very unlikely that any parts of bodies may still be found. We have searched the area very thoroughly, and brought back anything that resembled human remains,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy. `` All the bodies and parts of bodies have been transported to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial-Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> will try to identify them. Autopsies will be performed, but we do not expect to be able to identify more than about 100 of the bodies.'' So far, only the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot and a few other people recognizable by uniforms or distinctive marks have been positively identified, he said. The plane was flying precisely along its scheduled route, and preliminary analysis of flight data showed all systems on board failed at the same instant, indicating an explosion.

 A fire broke out at dawn Monday on a Danish ferry in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> while most of its 650 passengers and crew were asleep. Two Swedish passengers were reported killed and up to 50 people injured. One news report said the fire was believed caused by sabotage. The 600-foot Tor <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> was on its way from <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s western coast, to <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s east coast, when the blaze started, police said. `` I woke up from the smell of smoke in my cabin. No one came to wake us up,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmberg </PERSON>, a Swedish passenger. Witnesses said passengers calmly went to the rear of the ferry and waited. The fire was under control within hours, and the Danish ferry used its own engines to reach the <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION>, 90 miles to the east. Swedish national television quoted unidentified shipping officials as saying the blaze, which started in a linen closet in the front of the passenger deck, appeared to have been sabotage. It gave no details. Police said initially that two people were killed, and 10 were slightly injured. However, Danish national television said later that a total of 50 people were injured. It also said the two dead were Swedish passengers. However, authorities did not immediately release names and nationalities of the victims. Most of the 540 passengers were from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Danish national radio said <LOCATION> Tor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>'s communications equipment was destroyed by the fire and that the crew was unable to send out emergency signals. A passing ship saw smoke and alerted <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> authorities, the report said. Three Danish rescue helicopters were dispatched and at least nine ships, including the West German destroyer <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, rushed to the scene to help. The 14,893-ton Tor <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, owned by the Danish shipping company Scandinavian Seaways, was on regular service on the Goteborg-Harwich route. The vessel, which can carry 1,500 passengers and 400 cars, was built in 1976 in <LOCATION> Luebeck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and is one of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>'s largest ferries with a swimming pool, a gym and a movie theater

<HEAD>US Holding Up $3 Billion for Poorest Countries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has so far refused to promise $ 3 billion dollars it is expected to contribute to loans for the poorest countries of the world, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said Monday. The money would be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of a $ 14.5 billion fund to be lent out over three years to about 55 countries where the income of the average citizen is little more than a dollar a day. It would be distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, in 40-year loans at less than 1 percent interest a year, starting next July 1. `` Unfortunately, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not in a position this past week to advise its <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> partners of its ability to take an appropriate share of a ... replenishment of this magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Congressman. He spoke at a closed door meeting of the development committee which brings together representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, now holding their annual meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A copy of his statement was distributed to reporters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also holding out against a proposal to make a big increase in the $ 120 billion dollars now availale for the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> said earlier Monday that he thought a compromise would eventually be reached on about $ 80 billion in new money. About $ 16 billion of that would come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but unlike the <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> contribution, it would not be a charge on the federal budget. IDA's money is replenished every three years. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is now working on an appropriation of $ 975 million, the final <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to IDA for the current three-year period. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest giver among the 34 current donor countries _ it provides more than one dollar out of every five. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> held out hope that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would change its mind about the <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> contribution at a meeting to be held in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in November. Discussing the proposed new three-year pool of $ 14.5 billion, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said, `` to most members, agreement on this approximate amount seems feasible and they have indicated their willingness to take a reasonable share under the right circumstances.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition he not be named said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the only holdout. Some other countries, however, will make their contributions dependent on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution, so that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offers a smaller sum than expected, they might reduce their contributions too.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continued its strong criticism of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> Tuesday, saying the French open-door policy toward Chinese pro-democracy dissidents was `` brutal interference'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of violating <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and international laws. `` People ca n't help believing that, under the pretext of upholding human rights, the very purpose of the French government is to support the anti-Chinese government activities.'' The commentary came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a `` strong protest'' to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> over the staging in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of the inaugural meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a group headed by activists who fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> following the June 3-4 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. Like the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> asserted that the federation leaders are criminals who tried to overthrow the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, and that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was seriously threatening Sino-French relations by harboring them. The French government `` has the cheek to brag that its connivance and open support to the anti-Chinese government activities of <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and the like are for ` safeguarding human rights,''' it said, referring to the political scientist elected chairman of the federation. But the Chinese government is strong and stable, it said, and `` any scheme to subvert the People's Republic will surely end up in a daydream -- anyone who bets on a handful of national scums such as <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> is doomed to fail.'' The commentary noted that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was the first nation to declare a freeze on high-level contacts and other sanctions following the June suppression of dissent and these acts `` have led to a deterioration of the Sino-French relations.'' The daily also mentioned other recent cases of `` violent terrorist activities'' against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, such as a two-hour occupation of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> education section in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in late June, an attack on the office of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s airlines in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the alleged harassment by French border police of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials traveling through <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` All these could hardly be viewed as isolated and accidental,'' the daily said. `` The Chinese government has done nothing unfair to the French government, while the latter is going further in poisoning the bilateral relations.'' It said the late President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gualle </PERSON> had shown `` foresight and sagacity'' in establishing relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 25 years ago. `` We do not want to see the door closed again only because of the short-sightedness and recklessness of some people.''

<TEXT>
 The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met Monday in the communists' worst crisis since taking power in 1948, and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> was quoted as saying he made a mistake in agreeing to join party leadership. The meeting was to prepare for a party congress starting Oct. 6 that may lead to a split in party ranks. The congress was originally scheduled for next year but was advanced because of the immense political changes under way in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The closed-door session, presided over by party chairman <PERSON> Rezso </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, discussed a draft manifesto to be presented to the congress for debate that advocates a multiparty system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and a balanced distribution of power. A brief communique issued after the meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the talks were marked by `` lively and extensive debate,'' but gave no details, indicating considerable disagreement among party factions. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said 1,276 delegates were elected to the congress. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, a reformer who is also on the four-member Presidium, gave an indication of how deep the rifts are by saying even the four could not agree on all issues. Although it was a mistake for him to have joined the party leadership, he was quoted as saying, its mandate was only to lead the party until the party congress so it was not worth considering leadership changes now. According to <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> indicated he was prepared for a split in party ranks, saying he would `` do everything possible for the organization of a renewed party after the forthcoming congress which is aware that its fate at the elections will be decided ... on the basis of the government's performance.'' <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said he supported a broad, coalition government after the elections that includes `` all major political forces.'' Parliament is due to begin debate on Tuesday on key draft legislation toward a peaceful transition to a multiparty democracy that was agreed upon by the communist party and the opposition. In weekend speeches, reformers and conservatives highlighted the widening differences between the various factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is officially called the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berend </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, said in an article published in the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> that `` the confusion within the party is chaotic.'' Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a party reformer and Presidium member, said in an Italian TV interview the party should discard `` the organizational principle called ` democratic centralism.' In our endeavors, we feel related to the social parties of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He said Sunday the party would call itself simply a socialist party after the congress and would no longer be `` a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the Bolshevik and Stalinist sense of the word.'' Party conservatives have expressed fears <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reforms could lead it out of the Soviet sphere of influence and mean the end of socialism in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said no danger exists that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would leave the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> alliance. Referring to remarks by parliament speaker <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would like a neutral status in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said this was not in the interest of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` It would disrupt the European balance of power, destabilizing the region,'' he was quoted as saying. `` Therefore, no single Western power is encouraging us to do this.'' <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> could become neutral only if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact were dismantled and both superpowers supported the move. He said this could happen `` in the foreseeable future.''

 HIGHWAY 1, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Thousands of <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> soldiers jammed the main highway in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> on Monday night as they snaked toward the border on the eve of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pledged exit from a nearly 11-year-old war. Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, American-made trucks, jeeps and artillery and Chinese `` Liberation'' troop transport vehicles clogged the 20-foot-wide stretch of highway for 120 miles from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, to the Vietnamese border. Traffic on the road that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> used as one of its main invasion in December 1978 came to a standstill. Soldiers, stripped to their undershorts, hung hammocks under trucks, cooked rice by the side of the road, and draped their laundry from anti-aircraft guns on the final night before the border crossing begins. `` I am very happy to be returning home to my family,'' said one soldier from <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Binh </LOCATION> province. `` I have been in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for 10 years and seen my wife only three times.'' Peasants gathered by the side of the road and waved to the troops, whose uniforms were decorated with flowers and medals. Speakers set up for the occasion blared the Vietnamese-Cambodian `` friendship'' song and patriotic speeches, which were prepared for the government-orchestrated ceremony. Starting Tuesday, Vietnamese troops will return home overland, by ferry on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and via the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it is withdrawing the last 26,000 of its troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and ending its occupation of its Southeast Asian neighbor. The <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance movement calls the pullout a sham, but already <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have attacked a town in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in an apparent attempt to challenge the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> army, no longer aided by Vietnamese troops. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Monday that although the Vietnamese occupation is apparently ending, `` We believe that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> can not evade its responsibility to help achieve a comprehensive political solution in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' As for the prospect of a return to power by the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said this problem can best be dealt with through negotiations and a comprehensive political solution. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcasts monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> claimed the guerrillas had seized a `` strategic position'' on the road from the western town, <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, to the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>. Cambodian officials acknowledged recently that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla forces occupy parts of the gem-rich area near <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. But Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> predicted that the rebels would be unable to hold their ground. Cambodian officials and a Soviet military observer said the two sides were throwing their best divisions at each other in <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was raining up to 2,000 mortar shells a day on the town. The battle has raised fears that <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will slide into civil war after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s soldiers are gone. Many Cambodians say they are worried the government army will be unable to stand up to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Cambodians have begun stockpiling rice in some cities for fear that guerrilla forces may cut supply lines, sending the price of rice up at least 200 percent. Ethnic Vietnamese, who fear persecution under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, also have reportedly begun fleeing back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> seized power in 1975 from American-backed Gen. <LOCATION> Lon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nol </LOCATION> after a civil war. It ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1978 and killed hundreds of thousands of people in practicing an ultra-radical form of agrarian communism. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 and ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, replacing it with a government to its own liking. Since then, the conflict has been stalemated. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supplies the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> with weapons, and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> allows the guerrilla group to use its territory. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> supply <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with arms. Peace talks failed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last month. Earlier Monday, thousands of Vietnamese soldiers in personnel carriers and tanks rolled past the Royal Palace in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> as the Vietnamese army made what it said was its last exit from the capital. School children were brought to the central square to bid the Vietnamese invaders farewell. Soldiers rolled by in American-made equipment captured from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War. A long line of Dodge buses, `` <ORGANIZATION> Saigon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>'' written on their sides, led the convoy. <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>, president of the Vietnamese-installed government, thanked the commanders of two departing divisions and hailed `` the revolutionary friendship of the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples.''

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said on Monday it will consider itself bound by major world human rights treaties and will sign an accord allowing Poles to take complaints directly to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> legal authorities. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is already a member of the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agreement </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees fundamental human rights such as freedom of thought, religion and conscience. Monday's announcement extends <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s acceptance of international judgment of its human rights practices. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> attaches major weight to the implementation of human rights,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> told the 44th <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` We intend to accede to some instruments which are not yet binding on us.'' He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will accept the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That will allow Polish citizens to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in cases involving emigration, torture, forced labor, arbitrary arrest or detention, and freedom of thought, conscience, and peaceful assembly, among other rights. Legal experts on the committee can order compensation. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> ratified the protocol last year. <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will `` accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'' at The Hague in all cases involving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We think that the obligatory jurisdiction of the Court should be enhanced and supported,'' he said. The court, an organ of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, can recommend to states, but its rulings are not binding. Reflecting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s shift toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> since Solidarity entered the government, <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> continued: `` We also look forward to the day when it will be possible for us to become a member of the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.'' That convention, dating from 1950, also guarantees basic human rights. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s participation in the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would mean Poles could take human rights complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, whose findings are examined by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Nineteen European nations have accepted the mandatory jurisdiction of that court. The Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> includes an assembly and was founded in 1949 in an effort to create a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Last December, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s declared that human rights should be given new emphasis in international affairs. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also intends to sign the Optional Protocol, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights officials have said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said in March it would accept <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction in six human rights treaties. World legal experts hailed the decision, which reversed a Soviet post-World War II policy of resisting outside judgment of its practices.

 The city's first black police commissioner resigned Monday for health reasons after nearly six years on the job. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, appointed by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, cited asthma that has plagued him for almost two decades. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s term in office has been marked by spiraling crime rates and increased street violence, largely traceable to the crack epidemic that has taken hold of so many of the city's neighborhoods. `` I intended to stay with you to the very end but I am yielding to the chronic asthma that has sapped my strength,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said in a letter to <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>. As commissioner, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> oversaw a police department with 26,790 officers and 9,714 civilian employees. He joined the police force as an officer in 1951. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 63, riled Hispanics with remarks they found offensive. In November, he told a group of Hispanics, `` Tell your relatives to be careful where they buy drugs. We do n't want to confiscate their cars.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> mentioned asthma medication that `` may hype me up'' when he apologized in 1987 for telling a woman at public meeting she was prime rape material. He drew the ire of some black groups the same year when he called black crime against blacks `` our little dirty secret.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s term expires in 1991. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> lost the Democratic primary to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> this month and leaves office at the end of the year.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee voted Monday to continue the perk of free congressional mass mailings, reversing lopsided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes that sought to end the practice and use the savings to combat illegal drugs. The conferees voted overwhelmingly to spend $ 115.6 million for three newsletter mailings a year, acting only two hours after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 245-137 to stop the valuable campaign tool. The House action was a non-binding vote. It instructed conferees negotiating a congressional money bill to accept a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision barring virtually all mass mailings. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees, saying they knew members really wanted their free mailings, ignored the advice. The majority of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes went along with continuing the free mailings, although no formal vote was taken after the direction of the conference became clear. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began the anti-free mail campaign on Sept. 7 by voting 83-8 for an amendment to stop the newsletters and spend the $ 45 million savings to treat pregnant women addicted to drugs. The provision, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., would have banned all newsletters, town meeting notices and mailings to more than 500 households House members in the conference were furious that senators, by originally going on record against the mailings, tried to interfere with the way the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does business and then put <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members on the spot. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., said he will be prepared in the future to propose changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, which are far less strict in the use of campaign money for office expenses `` They want to keep their slush funds while posing for headlines,'' he said of senators. Obey said senators used the same tactic earlier this year, when they overwhelmingly rejected a proposed 51 percent pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but secretly hoped the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would find a way to pass an increase. Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations legislative subcommittee,, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s tinkering with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s affairs was a `` real breach'' of <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> cooperation and warned, `` We can have open warfare'' unless the interference stops During floor debate, <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> was critical of the instruction to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of the confernece committee. `` It's pure demagogy, but it's great politics,'' said <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, accusing his colleagues of voting to `` pose for holy pictures.'' While the decision to continue the mailings was overwhelmingly adopted by the conferees, not everyone was happy. Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., said `` the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal was not aimed at the House. And Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., who offered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution to follow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s lead, said he would refuse to sign the conference report because `` We gave away the store. The provision on mass mailing would establish separate mass mail accounts: $ 54.5 million, or 65 percent of the total, for the 435-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>; and $ 29.3 million, or 35 percent, for the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the provision calls for $ 31.7 million to cover mailing costs through the end of 1989. Currently, there are six mass mailings of newsletters a year, but they would be reduced to three beginning next Jan. 1. There would be a two-sheet limit. The motion to instruct conferees came on a motion by <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, who asked colleagues, `` Are you willing to give up a congressional perk to combat drug addiction in newborn babies? The frank has been abused.'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said that in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended about a month before congressional elections, the cost of newsletters rose steadily as the election approached _ from $ 5.9 million the first quarter to $ 16 million the last quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> mass mailings started at $ 3.8 million the first quarter and rose to $ 10 million in the fourth quarter. Supporters of the ban said more than 1,000 babies are born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each day with substance abuse symptons. They said the savings from the newsletter ban would permit a 10-fold increase in the pregnant addict programs.

 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigative panel on Monday rebuffed an eleventh-hour request by lawyers for former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to delay his subpoenaed testimony but said he would enforce a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule permitting <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to bar television coverage. The chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by television networks seeking to block <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s use of the rule and thus to permit electronic and photographic coverage of the hearing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> on Monday denied the networks' petition fo a temporary restraining order and said she would hear arguments at a later date on whether to grant a permanent injunction. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he opposes the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is using and has asked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders to back a repeal. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had anticipated the suit, telling reporters before it was filed that as a defendant he would not comment. The House Government Operations subcommittee on labor and housing, which has been probing the scandal at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> since last spring, voted last week to subpoena <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> after the former secretary canceled a voluntary appearance negotiated after two previous delays. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said attorneys for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> requested another delay on Monday, and he rejected it. `` I have no intention of postponing the hearing,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would appear. He declined to say what advice he had given his client, but seemed to hint that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> might not testify: `` I have made some strong recommendations based on my experience in these matters but no firm decision has been made. The secretary wanted to sleep on it and make a decision in the morning. If he agrees with my recommendations then I will make it clear to the subcommittee and to the press that it was my decision.'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> repeatedly has said the comments of subcommittee members have convinced him <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will not be treated fairly, a sentiment he repeated in an interview Monday night: `` It's hard for me to believe he can be given a fair shake.'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> had said earlier <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was willing to testify but needed more time to prepare. `` The subcommittee has attempted to accommodate Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in an extraordinary fashion,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` A subcommittee can not be at the mercy of a witness who procrastinates obtaining counsel.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> did not hire an attorney until early September, more than three months after he first appeared before the committee voluntarily and after a series of government reports outlined millions of dollars of apparant fraud at the department he headed for eight years. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he had not asked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorneys if their client would refuse to testify on constitutional grounds. `` I have no idea whther Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will take the 5th Amendment or not,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` We are prepared to have him testify.'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was invoking the little-used House rule that permits witnesses appearing under subpoena to ban radio, television and still photographic coverage of their appearances. He said he had asked the speaker and Rules Chairman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., to consider changing the rule He said he would abide by the speaker's decision, but was determined to seek a change in the next session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if not this one. `` It is my judgment that congressional hearings are very different'' now, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` It is my own view that the rule is no longer relevant, that it is obsolete ... It ought to be changed,'' he said. `` I believe it is unreasonable to discriminate'' against certain media. However, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he would oppose efforts to overturn the rule in the courts because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should have the right to set its own rules.

 The premier edition of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' new morning newspaper, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION>, was snatched up around the city Monday by curious and enthusiastic readers. `` The customers like the competition,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pointer </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> newstand in <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> where 700 copies were sold in about 2 -LCB- hours. `` They like another viewpoint.''

The court changed the conditions of his bail, lifting a ban it had previously imposed on him visiting his wife and their three young children. <PERSON> Osbourne </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON>, told the court that <PERSON> Osbourne </PERSON>'s wife had been to see her husband at <LOCATION> Huntercombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, where the court had sent him at a previous hearing. But <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said that when she invited her husband to their home at nearby <LOCATION> Amersham </LOCATION> the court ban then in force had stopped him accepting. `` It is clear the parties are successfully seeking to sort out their difficulties,'' <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> told the court. <PERSON> Osbourne </PERSON>, who wore a conventional suit and tie at the hearing, said `` Thank you'' when told he could visit his wife. His bail was extended until Oct. 18 on condition he remains a resident at the clinic.

 Japanese and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> ministers agreed Monday the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government should become a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member and discussed better treatment for Koreans in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and trade relations between the two Asian lands.

 Declaring the world `` has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered Monday to slash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of such weapons more than 80 percent provided the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reduces to an equal level. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, in his first speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> as president, was designed to spur a 40-nation conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to ban chemical weapons entirely within 10 years. He also used his appearance to salute `` freedom's march'' around the world _ in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ and to praise the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for removing `` a number of obstacles'' in the way of treaties to reduce long-range nuclear weapons, and troops and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted progress on those issues and agreements on other matters _ during talks last weekend between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> _ as well as a decision to hold a summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by early next summer. `` Let us act together _ beginning today _ to rid the earth of this scourge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his comments on chemical weapons. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said after the speech that the Soviets had `` a positive view'' of the plan but that it and other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals `` will have to be studied additionally.'' At a dinner later at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where he was host, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife shook the hands of 400 guests in a receiving line, among them Shevardnardze. <PERSON> Shevardnardze </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and later told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, also in the receiving line, `` We have some news from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> replied that he and Shevardnardze should find some time Tuesday or Wednesday for a short chat. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said the news might be a response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chemical weapons proposal, but no one knew. He said the Soviets had been given an outline of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative in advance and `` they really have not responded.'' He also told reporters at a briefing that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal did not include biological weapons, which some experts consider as deadly as poison gas. One year ago, during the first presidential candidates' debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said, `` I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has in the past accused the Soviets of developing biological weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed legislation requiring the administration to destroy old chemical weapons by 1997 as more advanced weapons are stockpiled. Asked about any connection between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal and the legal mandate to destroy a large percentage of such weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official said that whether or not the new plan was `` making a virtue of necessity it is certainly part of a major effort and a serious effort now.'' Twice, as vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blocked legislation to destroy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote. In those instances, the cutback would not have required Soviet reductions as well. To get down to the equal stocks that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed, the Soviets would have to make deeper cuts since they are thought to have more chemical weapons on hand. Only the two superpowers acknowledge having poison gas, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said more than 20 nations either possess them or can produce them. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration singled out <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as being on the verge of producing chemical weapons with the assistance of West German firms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters, `` This proposal really attacks the proliferation problem by making it impossible for these countries to argue that major countries have them and are just dragging their feet in chemical weapons negotiations.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permanent representative at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and 1972, described his visit and speech as a homecoming. The delegates interrupted him twice with applause _ when he proposed the chemical weapons reductions and when he reported progress in U.S.-Soviet relations. At one point, he also mourned the slaying of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was taken hostage on a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in February 1988 and subsequently slain. He called <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> `` a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving dedication to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ideal'' and called on the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to condemn the murder. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chemical weapons proposal has three key elements: _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` ready to begin now'' by eliminating more than 80 percent of its stockpile while working on a treaty, provided the Soviets also made their cuts _ In the first eight years of a 40-nation treaty the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would destroy nearly all _ 98 percent _ of its chemical weapons if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joined the ban _ All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons _ `` 100 percent, every one'' _ would be destroyed within 10 years, once all nations capable of building such weapons signed a total ban treaty As for superpower relations, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he saw `` signs of a new attitude'' in U.S.-Soviet relations. Also, `` we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state.'' As for chemical weapons, he said, `` These horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. ... This is unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to the use of poison gas by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in their <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The threat is considered potentially explosive especially in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> where <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is feared to have chemical weapons that could be placed on the tip of missiles and fired at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged monitoring and enforcing a ban would be a challenge. But, he said, inspection procedures developed for nuclear weapons cutbacks offer useful experience. American chemical weapons stockpiles are estimated at about 30,000 tons. A small portion is stored in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has admitted to possessing about 50,000 tons, though some analysts believe the arsenal is larger. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> outlined the plan to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at their talks last weekend in Jackson Hole, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. There they agreed to exchange information about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet chemical weapons and to conduct cross-inspections of arsenals and plants. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Monday that `` from the very beginning we stood for the total elimination of all chemical stockpiles.'' In a long day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the President also hosted a lunch for the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and held separate meetings with President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Vinizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At dinner, the President said in a toast `` the resolution of conflicts by non-violent, political means has now taken center stage. And the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is leading the way.'' He was nearly 20 minutes late for the dinner and offered `` A thousand apologies'' when he and his wife finally arrived. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was delayed by meetings with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Banks reopened, a trickle of mail was delivered and trash collection resumed in this hurricane-battered city Monday, but a cold downpour hindered efforts to restore power and worsened damage to roofless homes. Two inches of rain fell, and temperatures were in the 60s. An 80 percent chance of showers was forecast for Tuesday. `` It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to make everything a little more miserable,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. At Isle of Palms, a barrier island where martial law was declared to preserve order, residents boarded ferries for their first look at destruction wrought by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> since they were evacuated Thursday. A bridge to the mainland and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> was wiped out. Residents were allowed to fill one suitcase each before they were asked to leave again. The shattered houses made the one-time seaside paradise look like a war zone. `` It looks like what happens after artillery fire,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer. Residents of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were still unable to return to their elite resort community on a 60-mile stretch of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s coast known as the Grand Strand The town's entrance was guarded by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION>, but that did not prevent looting. `` There was a lady just filling her bags with stuff,'' said shopowner <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>. `` I've caught people stealing here three days straight. It's like stealing from a graveyard.'' It was far from a normal workday in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where electrical service was restored to hospitals but hot meals and water for drinking and bathing was were still in short supply. Late Monday, Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said the city's water system was pumping potable water and 400,000 residents did not have to continue boiling water before drinking it. The downpour hampered utility crews toiling to string power lines. In homes already hit by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s blustery winds, rainwater compounded matters by seeping through damaged roofs in this 300-year-old city. `` There's a greater chance of problems with hot wires because of the standing water,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` When it's wet, it just slows you down.'' Frustration grew in some of the hardest hit neighborhoods, where residents patched damaged roofs with plastic sheeting to keep out the rain. `` The whole town's going to be called ` Hell Hole' soon. That's what it's going to be, one big hell hole,'' complained <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> Seven C & amp; S bank branches and automatic teller machines opened in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, allowing residents to cash checks to buy gas and other supplies. Other branches opened along the coast. `` We've been out of money since Thursday,'' said <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Myrick </PERSON>, a customer who needed cash to buy gas and food. `` I thought of everything in the world to prepare for the storm, but I did n't think of money,'' said <PERSON> Emmit </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. `` We've got trees to cut down and you've got to have money to pay folks.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a C & amp; S official in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, said offices would be open four hours a day until power is restored. `` If it had n't have been for the rain, we would have been swamped,'' he said. `` We have some locations where there are literally lines out the doors.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> pleaded for donations of money, lumber, canned food, disposable diapers and clothing. He set up a relief hot line. `` We've got a lot of people who are hurting here and they need our help,'' he said. A curfew remained in effect for <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrolled with bayonetted M-16 rifles to discourage looters. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, about 550 National Guardsmen patrolled, 350 of them in <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, but at least 546,000 remained without service. It could be a month before full service is restored, utility officials said. The 12th strongest hurricane to hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland this century slammed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with 135 mph winds late Thursday. The six-day rampage of Hugo and its remnants killed at least 61 people _ at least 33 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and 28 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're looking at damage between $ 1 and $ 2 billion,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He toured the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast Monday. State and local officials have estimated damage at $ 3 billion or more. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday declared four inland <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties as disaster areas eligible for federal help. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> previously declared seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties disaster areas. Insurance agents went house-to-house, gathering estimates and handing out claim checks. Some of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s victims may not be able to rebuild under a state law designed to curb beach erosion by limiting development. All reconstruction and repairs close to the water will require a permit from the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are considering an order that will allow people to repair houses provided they are less than 66 and two-thirds -LRB- percent -RRB- damaged,'' administrator <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The council will send crews out to confirm the damage before work can begin. In <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, 180 miles inland, residents suffered through a fourth day without electricity, water and food. `` We do n't know what's going on, when we'll get help,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We've had grits for the children for two days, but the Sterno's giving out.'' In <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, beaches were off limits because of contamination from sewage. The problem was blamed on residents who refuse to conserve water. `` People just ca n't shower until they utterly ca n't stand each other,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>, a city spokesman. `` They should also avoid flushing until it's absolutely necessary. If people do n't cooperate, we'll have to turn the water off. The storm also took its toll on more than half of the state's cotton crop, leveled much of the corn fields and put the soybean harvest in doubt, officials said Agricultural losses were estimated at $ 45 million to $ 50 million.

 <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> $ 300,000 and other perks to keep his mouth shut after <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> took over the scandal-ridden <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, the TV ministry's chief builder testified Monday. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> denied the account given by builder <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who testified for the defense at <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud trial. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> also said a chief <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aide claimed <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> knew nothing about $ 265,000 in hush money to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the church secretary with whom <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had a sexual encounter in 1980. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of defrauding followers by using more than $ 3.7 million in ministry money to live in high style. The TV evangelist faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, founder of the now defunct Moral Majority, took over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in the scandal involving Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> testified that the offer to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> from <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> included a maid, a security guard and telephone expenses if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` kept his mouth shut.'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> wrote at the bottom of the piece of paper: `` I'm not making any demands on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. I'm not asking for anything.'' It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> turned down the alleged offer. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> was not questioned further about the matter. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> was mistaken. The offer actually was a demand from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> dispatched <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to talk to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, but he carried no offer, <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> returned with a handwritten list of demands on the pink stationery of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s demands included hospital insurance, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s $ 300,000 annual salary for life, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s $ 100,000 annual salary for life, royalties on inspirational books and recordings made by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>, secretary and maid service for a year, use of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> lakefront house and furniture and attorneys' fees. `` Simply put, the items <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> testifed that Rev. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> sent him out to offer <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> were items that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> requested and <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> presented to Rev. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. `` I would like to think <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> just forgot the sequence of events.'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> testified that he handled the $ 265,000 payment to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. He said he was called by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, on Feb. 21, 1985. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> told <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> that if he did n't pay a woman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> $ 265,000 then she would go to The <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> Observer with allegations that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> raped her. Five days later, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said, he wired the $ 265,000 to an account number in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that was given to him by <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> knew about the payment. He said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> replied: `` No, I'm acting on my own.'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he agreed to make the payment in part because the Assemblies of God was named as the potential party in a lawsuit threatened by Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` I did n't think the church ought to be dragged into this incident,'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said. Contributors to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> who remain supportive of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> also testified. `` I've always thought from the beginning that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was a giver,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Garmager </PERSON>, a television director from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators reached tentative agreement on a plan they hope will eventually eliminate all high seas salmon fishing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. During talks in <LOCATION> Lenningrad </LOCATION> last week, both nations also: _ Expressed concern about the illegal harvesting of salmon by drift net fleets in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and agreed to seek `` multilateral cooperation in effectively regulating such fishing practices.'' _ Decided to establish an advisory committee that will develop recommendations that could lead to regulation of bottom fishing in an area of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> known as the `` doughnut hole.'' The salmon plan envisioned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would, if <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed, replace the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>. The convention has overseen the regulation of salmon fishing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> since the 1950s. Besides the illegal harvest of salmon by the drift net fleets, some nations allow a `` directed'' high seas salmon catch. `` The convention terms discussed reflect the view of the two sides that high seas fishing for anadromous resources is irrational and wasteful,'' the joint-statement said. The new agreement would include `` significant enforcement provisions'' aimed at preventing illegal harvesting of salmon and increased scientific cooperation. `` The idea is to prohibit salmon fishing on the high seas,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, who as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for oceans and fisheries led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the Lenningrad talks. `` This is something that will save our salmon.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said he expected that the legal high seas salmon fishing currently allowed on a limited basis would also be `` phased out.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> all have salmon stocks that migrate into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>.

 Suspected Communist rebels killed a captain from President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s guard force Tuesday and six police were injured in a clash with students protesting the visit of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Capt. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Daileg </PERSON>, a staff officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, was slain about 7 a.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT Monday -RRB- in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pandacan </LOCATION> district, about one mile southeast of the presidential palace. The assailants, armed with .45 - caliber pistols, escaped in a commandeered vehicle, police <PERSON> Daileg </PERSON> was the fourth member of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s guard force slain in the past four months. <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Erfe </PERSON>, acting commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said he suspected the assailants were an urban assassination team of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a 20-year insurgency to establish a Communist state. The Presidential Security Group provides guards for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and foreign dignitaries. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is due to arrive in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> late Tuesday from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a three-day visit. In another incident, police Tuesday broke up a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Adamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> leftist </ORGANIZATION> students protesting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit. Police said six officers were injured when the militants hurled a small, homemade explosive device. Nine students were arrested. Security was first stepped up Monday as leftist groups promised protests and a grenade exploded on the ground floor of an office building in the financial district, slightly injuring two women. The assailant escaped. The grenade blasts over the last two weeks have killed at least two people, prompting officials to place police and military units on alert in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area. Security has also been stepped up because leftist groups have called for demonstrations when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrives. He is expected to discuss the future of the six <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. On Monday, Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> called for phasing out the bases over five to 10 years to avoid serious disruptions in the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> economy and regional balance of power. `` I stress the need for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to undertake its own external defense eventually,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. `` Right now, we are completely dependent on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In another development Monday, President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities for releasing a report that erroneously linked her to a gun-running case. She chided the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy for a report claiming she had signed an authorization for weapons purchased in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and seized Sept. 5 in the luggage of a Filipino congressman, <PERSON> Nicanor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>. He was charged last week with illegal weapons possession. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said a report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> bureau was provided to the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government at its request. The report quoted a gun dealer in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area as saying Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` allegedly'' signed the authorization. Filipino officials later said the document was signed by Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I imagine whoever this person was _ the gun store dealer _ thought that I am the only one with the name <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters. `` What I want to see is that my name not be taken to lightly.''

 Federal investigators went inside the wreckage of a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet Monday, looking for additional clues to the cause of last week's aborted takeoff and crash into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that killed two people. Local authorities announced a grand jury would investigate the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 to see if any criminal charges are warranted. The aircraft was headed for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, when it slid off the runway. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>, district attorney in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> where the airport is located, said he initially had no designated targets and would not seek specific charges. But sources in <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>'s office said the grand jury might be asked to consider charges including criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident An airplane is considered a vehicle under state law. The last pieces of the jet, which landed partly in the water and partly on a row of pilings, were pulled from the river Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators were `` for the first time getting an opportunity to really go into the wreck and find out what exists in the wreckage,'' said <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Over the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the rookie co-pilot had inadvertently pushed a button that cut the throttle. The board said pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> told investigators he decided to abort takeoff because of a strange vibration and because the aircraft was drifting to the left. However, the unexplained veer to the left also was being investigated. The crash of Flight 5050 late Wednesday killed two people; 59 others were rescued from the of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 36, and co-pilot <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> were criticized by federal officials for failing to submit immediately to drug and alcohol testing, although they are not legally required to do so. They submitted urine samples Friday. Results will not be available for three weeks. On Saturday, they also gave urine samples to the district attorney's office after they were told a warrant was being prepared. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` did n't want anybody to see his face'' and had a blanket wrapped around his head when he met local investigators, said <PERSON> Piperno </PERSON>. The two pilots' flight licenses were also suspended because they disappeared from the accident scene. Local criminal charges against a flight crew would be highly unusual, according to industry insiders. `` We're not aware of criminal charges in the past ever being brought here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against an airline pilot'' following a crash, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Macor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I do n't recall it happening before,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON>. A lawyer for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>, has said he believes his clients committed no criminal act. <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, 29, who had flown a 737-400 only once before on a passenger flight, was at the controls, but <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> took over the throttle after <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> pushed the button, authorities said.

 Quebec Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> easily won a second straight majority government for his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, but with a slightly reduced margin over a revitalized nationalist <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION>. `` I believe that this is a sign of confidence,'' a smiling <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> said at his district headquarters. Besides the continuing quarrel between French and English speakers, the campaign was marked by environmental protests and labor unrest. The Parti Quebecois, which had been reeling from its election debacle four years ago and was suffering from internal struggles only last year, ran a strong campaign on its platform of eventual independence for the majority French-speaking province and gained seats. `` We have progressed solidly toward the goal that we think is the right one,'' its leader, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON>, said in reiterating his separatist aims. `` Even if we have n't had as many seats as we wanted, is n't it marvelous, this idea of independence for Quebec?'' he told supporters, who broke into chants of `` Le <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> aux Quebecois -LRB- <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> for Quebecers -RRB-.'' `` They said it -LRB- independence -RRB- was dead,'' <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> added. `` It is alive.'' A new Equality Party formed by English speakers irate over <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s pro-French language policies won two seats in the 125-member provincial assembly and tight races were going for two more. But <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s Liberals had won or were leading in more than two-thirds of the districts. A Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> projection after the polls closed at 8 p.m. EDT indicated the Liberals had won or were leading for 91 seats, the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> for 30 and the Equality Party for four. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, whose party has held power in the province for four years, had predicted the win as he voted in his home district of Outremont, where he was re-elected. Late Monday, as <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> was leaving his home, where he watched the results with his family, he yelled out he was feeling `` very happy.'' <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> had predicted a good showing for his party, which moved up steadily in the polls through the election campaign in this predominately French-speaking province. The Equality Party was in a tight race for a third seat. Equality Party worker <PERSON> Jocelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON> said she was `` ecstatic'' about the six-month-old party's showing. `` When we started we had to think it would happen, and it did.'' During the campaign, the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> tried to capitalize on environmental and labor protests that overshadowed <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s promises of continued prosperity The Liberals won 99 of 122 seats in the provincial assembly four years ago, and pre-election opinion polls showed little likelihood that the Parti Quebecois would be able to muster the 42 percent of the popular vote needed to make much of a dent this year. But under leader <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON>, who won an internal struggle last year to put the separatist party back on a hard-line course, the party showed during the campaign it was not in danger of either disappearing or becoming irrelevant. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, an economist, counted on <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> residents being more interested in prosperity than in independence. He touted a 4 percent annual economic growth rate, the creation of 233,000 new jobs and the social stability that lasted through most of his term. But the idea of separatism, thought to have been put to rest in a 1980 referendum in which 60 percent of the voters rejected it, proved surprisingly durable. The Parti Quebecois won 38.7 percent of the popular vote in the December 1985 provincial election. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s support among <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s English-speaking minority, which traditionally votes <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION>, may have been hurt by his refusal in December to allow more than a token change in provincial laws restricting commercial signs to the French language. His compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors _ and as long as the French-language portion was significantly larger than the English. Quebec, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest and second-most populous province with 6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking. It has 4.6 million registered voters. Supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to protect <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s special culture.

<TEXT>
 Some call it corrupting the classics. But conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> calls it Popera. Popera is a program he started at <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which plays well-known operatic pieces for people who do n't normally attend opera. `` Everyone thinks opera is ` it's not over until the fat lady sings,''' he said. `` But that's changing. Anything in art is sort of like porno films _ you have to participate to really appreciate it.'' For <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, opera is an emotional outlet for fantasy, and his goal through <PERSON> Popera </PERSON> is to expand that fantasy to people with only a passing acquaintance with the music. Opera suffers from its reputation as an art for fanatics and through the Popera program, which has been duplicated elsewhere, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> has sought to convince listeners that opera is n't unattainably highbrow Programs have included excerpts from `` Carmen,'' `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>,'' `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' and other operas in which people recognize the melody, but do n't know its origins. `` I wanted to get away from the elitist and break down the barriers,'' <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> has not been alone. Opera, it seems, is all around _ in movie scores and in plays, in commercials for pizzas. There is even an album entitled `` Madison Avenue Goes to the Opera.'' Purists rail against the trend, fearing people will learn the tunes, but miss the point. But <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> argues that there's nothing wrong with it. `` It's fun,'' he said An elderly couple once wrote him after they attended a Popera concert in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> and thanked him for giving them `` a new love in their old age.'' <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> would like to bring his baton to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one place in which the transplanted <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> has never played. `` It's pretty depressing not to have played in your hometown,'' <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> said in a recent interview while he was visiting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for auditions. `` But I think it's just a matter of time.'' He has been approached by companies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but for one reason or another, his return home has never worked out. It's not for lack of recognition; <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> made his debut in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and has conducted at most major opera houses in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and many in this country. His reputation led to his selection as the conductor of the world premiere of <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON>'s `` The Wedding Day'' at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics. He founded an opera company in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and has been credited with saving the company in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> _ where he now lives _ through <LOCATION> Popera </LOCATION>. He's won applause at annual appearances in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> opera buffs have never seen him at the podium. He tries not to dwell on it. He's too busy. Born in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> lived on three continents before his first birthday. His family fled <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War II by way of <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> before settling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where his father operated a French-language bookstore. <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, the youngest of three boys, began playing the piano when he was 3 years old. `` My mother wanted to be a concert pianist,'' he said. `` But her father would n't hear of it. It was n't proper for a woman at that time.'' At 14, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> decided to live on his own in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, supporting himself by playing jazz in clubs, sometimes finishing early enough to catch humorist <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> perform. Playing both oboe and piano, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> at 16. He toyed with five majors before settling on a career in conducting. He went to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on a Fulbright Fellowship. In <LOCATION> Siena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he happened upon an opera class. He watched from the balcony, became fascinated by the music and decided he wanted to conduct opera on the spot. He arranged to audition for the class that afternoon. `` I did n't know the scores,'' he recalled. `` I studied over lunch.'' He made it, and he's been successful ever since, conducting at the <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staatsoper </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Grand Opera, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teatro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fenice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Teatro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carla </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Opera House. He also has served as artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. Four years ago, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> was asked to take over the helm of the struggling Opera <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a small company, gives him the opportunity to experiment _ an opportunity that he might not have at a larger company. Still, he would like to move on to a bigger troupe within the next decade; he's aware that whatever happens, his abilities are well known. `` They -LRB- opera companies -RRB- keep asking me back,'' he said. `` I must be doing something right.''

<HEAD>Karl Marx Rediscovered as China Stresses Ideological Orthodoxy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> has been dusted off to do battle against what Chinese leaders regard as the serious threat of liberal thinking. Marxist theory is making a strong comeback in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as students, their democracy movement crushed, file off to political education classes and <ORGANIZATION> Commmunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, trying to figure out what went wrong, return to their ideological roots. The basic theories and tenets of Marxism have been `` lashed by trends of bourgeois liberalization,'' party theorists concluded at a recent meeting. The main reason for the student protests of this past spring, they said, was `` serious confusion in ideology and theory.'' The conservative leadership in charge since the military crackdown in early June on the democracy movement is now moving to correct ideological heresy. The official press is bombarding readers with commentaries on the need to study Marxist-Leninist thought. People are constantly being reminded that `` only socialism can save <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> there would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The Guangming Daily, a newspaper for Chinese intellectuals, noted recently that critics say Marxism `` combined with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s feudalism to form feudalist Marxism. But it contended history has proved that `` socialism has taken root, germinated, blossomed, brought forth fruit and stood many severe tests.'' <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> is on every student's reading list this fall as educators try to repair the damage done by the democracy movement. `` In the days when bourgeois liberalization spread unchecked, many regarded Marxist theoretical education as a disgusting extra burden and a troublesome matter which must be studied although it is useless,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s People's Daily said. `` Why has such a monstrous absurdity happened in a socialist republic where Marxism is the guiding ideology?'' On the annual Teachers Day in September, a senior party official, <ORGANIZATION> Song </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ping </ORGANIZATION>, urged teachers to persuade students of the superiority of socialism. `` Antagonistic forces and those who stubbornly cling to bourgeois liberal values are doing their utmost to win the younger generation away from us. Our colleges and universities must never train our own gravediggers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about bourgeois or Western leanings among its 48 million members, is demanding more serious study of the ideological basics. `` We can smash the fond dream of international capitalism'' to lead <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> down the capitalist road `` if we use Marxism-Leninism to arm the broad masses of party members,'' Politburo member <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> told students at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the senior leader best known outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for introducing market-oriented reforms that challenged basic tenets of the state-planned economy, is now being hailed for creative contributions to Marxism. Political theory took a new leap forward, the People's Daily said, when <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> in 1979 came up with the concept of the `` four principles'' _ allegiance to the socialist system, the dictatorship of the people, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Marxist-Leninist, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> thought. Marxist thought has always been a guiding force for the party, but in recent years the prevailing feeling as been that some of what the 19th century philosopher was saying was no longer applicable to 20th century political and economic forces. In December 1985 the People's Daily noted that <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> had been dead for 101 years and `` we can not depend on the works of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> to solve our modern-day questions.'' The next day it put out an awkward correction, saying <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> ca n't solve `` all'' problems. The day after that the Guangming Daily said, `` If new ideas are not implemented and new Marxist conclusions and answers are not brought forth, then so-called support for the basic tenets of Marxism will only be empty talk.'' Last year the same newspaper, now a bastion of support for the battle against liberalism, commented that there are mistakes in the works of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <PERSON> Engels </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must `` pluck up its courage to restudy capitalism'' so as to `` creatively develop Marxist theory.'' The final insult appeared to come on May Day when for the first time in three decades huge portraits of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <PERSON> Engels </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> failed to appear on Tiananmen Square for the annual labor day celebrations. But <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> now is definitely back in the fold.

<TEXT>
 Three decades after he and a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer set a world record by diving as deep in the sea as jetliners fly high in the sky, the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> deep-sea researcher <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON> has designed a submarine for tourists. It will be launched in the spring by a private company and will offer passengers `` an uncommon way to share the riches of the sea.'' The $ 4-million craft, which will seat 16 people and a crew of two, is nearing completion at a Swiss plant in <LOCATION> Winterthur </LOCATION>. It will be somewhat roomier than the bathyscaph `` Trieste'' that went down 32,748 feet to Challenger Deep at the bottom of the Marianas Trench in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> on Jan. 23, 1960, with <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON> and Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> on board. Exploring life underwater has since filled most of the 67-year-old <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON>'s life. He has done research for universities, governments, and the police, collecting marine samples, and checking up on underwater pipelines. `` We have found everything from automobile tires to aircraft down there,'' he said. He still boards his small `` working sub'' about twice a week, diving in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ` s largest freshwater body. Launched in 1979, the sub named after the Swiss scientist F.A. Forel has been used on scientific, industrial, and recovery missions in many European lakes as well as in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. In 1969, <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON> and five other scientists spent a month exploring the Gulf Stream in the mesoscaphe <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, also designed by him. But he says none matched the experience he had on his world record dive. `` By far the most interesting find was the fish that came floating by our porthole at the bottom of the Challenger Deep,'' he said in an interview. `` We were astounded to find higher marine life forms down there at all.'' Having more people share the riches of the sea is an idea initiated by his father, <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON>, who also made scientific history in the stratosphere in the early 1930s, ascending 50,400 feet in a balloon of his own design. `` I came up with the idea of sending tourists underwater and it was my father who designed the world's first tourist submarine,'' <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON> said. During the Swiss National Exhibition in 1964, the father's submarine carried more than 30,000 people to the depths of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON>'s new 33-ton, 40-foot PX44 has several more sophisticated features and more advanced electronic equipment than his father's. It will cruise at three miles an hour and be capable of diving to 300 feet on tours of up to 40 minutes, <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON> said. Powerful searchlights and large portholes will bring the depths of the sea to brilliant life for the passengers entering the world of scuba divers in relaxed, first-class comfort. But for <PERSON> Piccard </PERSON>, the PX44 will also help bring greater awareness of the environmental threats to the world's seas. `` For me, the more people discover the sea, the greater the chance of bringing marine issues into public view and the better off we will all be,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 For the past several months, 16-year-old <PERSON> Marcio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> has been closely following the nine candidates running in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s presidential-election campaign. That's because he'll be casting a ballot for one of them on Nov. 15 in the nation's first direct presidential election in 29 years. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has lowered the voting age from 18 to 16, the only country in the world other than <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to allow citizens so young to vote. `` Why should n't I be excited?'' said <PERSON> Martins </PERSON>, a prep-school student. `` Just because I'm 16 does n't mean I'm not politically mature or do n't take voting seriously.'' The lowering of the voting age is not expected to have any dramatic effect the outcome of the election. Just 4.5 million Brazilians under 18 _ less than 6 percent of the total voting population of 81.5 million _ registered to vote by the Aug. 6 deadline, according to the government's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, none of the presidential front-runners has made a special drive to attract voters under 18. But the voting experiment has sparked harsh debate across this country of 144 million people on the role teen-agers should play in Brazilian society. `` Young Brazilians today are being confronted with reality at an earlier age,'' said <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadrado </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> McCann-Erickson </ORGANIZATION> reserch and planning department in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s biggest city. `` They are more equipped to make such decisions at their age than teen-agers of past generations.'' In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 16-year-olds can work, pay taxes, marry and open bank accounts, she said. Supporters also say television, radio and a stronger educational system have produced a generation that is better-informed and prepared to take on the responsibility of voting than young people 30 years ago. Allowing 16 - and 17-year-olds to vote will help cement democracy in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s nascent republic and discourage the young from tacitly accepting future military takeovers, said Sen. <PERSON> Afonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Arinos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, a leading of the lower voting age The military seized power in 1964 and did not relinquish it until 1985, when the civilian <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> took office as president after a military-controlled electoral college vote. Critics of the lower voting age contend that teen-agers lack experience in decision-making and will fall prey to campaign jingoism and flash instead of focusing on substantive issues. `` People under 18 are not psychologically mature enough to comprehend the meaning or importance of their vote,'' said <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastos </PERSON>, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION>. But the expectation surrounding the months leading up to the election also seem to typify the mood of many young registered voters. Angered by indecision and charges of nepotism in their government and frustrated by shrinking job markets and spiraling inflation, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s young view their vote as a tool for drastic change, surveys and interviews show. Young people, though aware of the economic strains imposed by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 110-billion foreign debt, overwhelmingly blame official corruption for the nation's problems, according to a recent survey of youths 15 to 24 years old in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. `` More and more teen-agers are realizing that we ourselves are one of the last hopes for turning our country around,'' said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON>, 16, a high school student in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the national capital. Overwhelmingly, the most pressing problem facing the country's new leader is inflation, now runnign at 1,084 percent a year `` My friends talk often about economics and what it'll be like when we finish school,'' said <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, 17, a student in an English-language institute in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Juiz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fora </LOCATION>. `` We never talked this way until a few years ago.'' A depressed educational system, environmental abuse in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, violence and social injustice are other prominent issues for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s newest voters. As a result, Brazilian teen-agers are turning to liberal candidates who advocate socialist-oriented economic reform. `` The right wing has been running the country for years and look how things are,'' said <PERSON> Edno </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Braz </PERSON> <PERSON> Serafim </PERSON>, 16, a Rio student. He said he plans to vote for <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> of the far-left Workers' Party. One right-of-center candidate that has appealed to young voters is <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, a 40-year-old upstart candidate from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s poor Northeast who has pledged to clean up government. `` He's new blood,'' said <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 16, another Rio student. `` He has n't gotten himself wound up in scandals. That's important to a lot of young people. Many 16 - and 17-year-olds consider their new right a priviledge `` We're expected to perform more like adults each day,'' said 17-year-old <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, a Rio student. `` Giving us the chance to vote lets us express how we feel about the changes around us.''

<HEAD>Budget Sequester Awaits on Oct. 1</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like a bureaucratic bogeyman, a dreaded `` sequester'' is lurking at the gates of government. That's federal jargon for an automatic cut in spending, required by law if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House do n't settle on a deficit-reduction plan by Oct. 16. The word `` sequester'' actually is a verb meaning to set apart, withhold or confiscate. `` ... We are drifting toward a sequester,'' Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the Republican whip, said the other day, and blamed the Democratic leadership in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the prospect of what he said would be a bureaucratic nightmare. The word and the partisan argument will be repeated frequently in the debate that begins in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week on a comprehensive budget bill that is supposed to trim the projected federal deficit below the legal limit of $ 110 billion, a measure now snarled in the dispute over taxes. Unless the budget bill is law before Oct. 16, automatic budget cuts will have to be ordered to enforce the deficit ceiling. And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will veto any budget bill that includes a tax rate increase _ like the one <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders want to put into the measure. All of that raises the likelihood that at least the first phase of the deficit control law _ the jargon for that is `` Gramm-Rudman'' _ will be triggered next month. The president then would order across-the-board spending cuts to hold the anticipated deficit under the ceiling. Another wrinkle: if the deficit goals are met prior to the deadline, there's $ 10 billion in leeway. But if the automatic cuts are triggered, that cushion is eliminated and the limit becomes $ 100 billion. All of that was put into place to do something about the worsening deficit habit. In 1987, the system was triggered and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had to order about $ 23 million in spending cuts in order to meet the limits of the law. They took effect only temporarily. Republicans now are saying that it could happen for real this time. `` ... Maybe we'll have the first real taste of Gramm-Rudman across-the-board sequester in order to accomplish the $ 100 billion deficit that's required by that law,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, R-N.M. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, ranking Republican on the budget committee, said the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> would have to draw up cuts of about 5.3 percent in domestic programs and 4.6 percent in defense in order to come up with about $ 16.8 billion in savings. That process would begin Oct. 1. But it will be a while before anything really happens. Even if the cuts actually took effect, they would not be locked into place for 30 days. The cuts triggered in 1987 never did become permanent; government agencies got their money back after the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> negotiated a budget agreement. This fall's budget measure was stalled even before it became the arena for a tax fight that echoes the presidential campaign of 1988. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won committee approval of his proposed capital gains tax cut over the opposition of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, and they now have drafted a rival plan including an income tax rate increase on the wealthiest taxpayers. `` I will veto a rate increase,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a Thursday night television interview. `` ... I have sent that signal up to the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.'' `` Well then, we'll try to send it to him and let him veto it,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> retorted on Friday. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the president told <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders he was not going to accept take-ot-or-leave-it budget bills including amendments he would veto if they stood alone. That draws lines for the argument over who will be to blame if there are, indeed, automatic spending cuts for popular programs. And in debates like this one, those are the programs that get the attention. That's standard procedure. So the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> has warned that cuts could force such measures as three-day layoffs of air traffic controllers and reductions in loans and grants for needy college students. `` I think we're going to see one of the most important periods of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency in the next 45 days,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. He said it will be `` a real test of will'' between the Democrats and the president, with the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> `` apparently willing to potentially risk sequester'' to get their programs.

 The new season brings a new reason for thinking you're still looking at the summer festival of rejected pilots on network television. Have you seen <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Chicken Soup'' or `` Homeroom'' or CBS' `` Top of the Hill? No wonder the three networks are losing viewers to alternative viewing. No wonder their share of the audience is down to 62 percent. The share dropped below 60 percent during the summer. The fall season got under way officially last week, and the offerings are mixed. First, the good news. <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>, last seen vamping on `` Dynasty,'' has taken the vows and borrowed the tongue of an asp to have a go at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>. She rides herd on a group of unruly orphans who are the dickens. -LRB- Sorry, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. -RRB- It does have a nice twist and great expectations. `` The Famous Teddy Z'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> is the kind of agent your mother would want you to take home. Laughing all the way, of course. Creator <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is at his best tilting his lance at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, and actor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> makes the little twerp endearing. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Life Goes On'' is a satisfying story of a family coping with the usual problems plus a teen-age son with Down's syndrome. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who has the genetic condition himself, is <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>, and if you do n't watch out he'll charm your socks off. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Young Riders'' shows promise. It follows a group of <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> riders whom one critic called `` hunks on horseback.'' Anyway, it's great to see another Western on the air. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hardball'' looks tolerable. Its premise of a hard-charging cop getting on in years who struggles to keep up with his young partner is an interesting one. Here's the bad news. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Chicken Soup'' appears to be on its way to becoming a smash hit. Simply because if follows `` Roseanne.'' Scheduled anywhere else this show would be gone in a few weeks. It's not funny and it has no charm. The so-called `` <PERSON> Abie </PERSON>'s Irish Rose'' romance between <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> does n't generate enough heat to warm a flea. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, even at his cheeriest, comes across like a messenger of Doom. CBS' `` Top of the Hill'' started with great potential. The surfer son of an ailing congressman takes over his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. His idealism clashes with political realism. It has touches of `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' That lasted about five minutes. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Katt </PERSON>, quickly becomes involved in freeing a federal agent being held by a drug lord in a Latin American country. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to upset a friendly government, so no official action is taken. The possibilities for a Contra-type story arise. <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Grammer </PERSON> does a nice turn as an `` ugly American'' foreign service officer, but otherwise forget it. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s heroics become so unbelievable you expect <PERSON> Katt </PERSON> to get back into his costume from `` The Greatest American Hero.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Homeroom'' will never move to the head of the class. Not funny, no appeal. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nutt House'' is too much shtick. While <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cloris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leachman </PERSON> are marvelously loony, the show needs one sane person for them to revolve around. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` Alien Nation'' should just get on with telling its stories and lay off the heavy-handed preaching. We do n't need to be hit over the head to get its message of tolerance. CBS' `` The People Next Door'' is the kind of show that makes you wonder what's happening to the neighborhood. Tai n't funny, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>. No hard opinions yet either way: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.,'' CBS' `` Island Son,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Matters,'' CBS' `` Peaceable Kingdom.'' CBS' `` Snoops'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Mancuso, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'' are still unseen, but the expectations are high.

<TEXT>
 Author <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> once said a novel `` is balanced between a few true impressions and the multitude of false ones that make up most of what we call life.'' Could the same be said about the economy? You judge. _ We continue to experience the longest peactime economic expansion in our history, an experience that is often misinterpreted to mean that these are the best of economic times They may not be. By some measures they might even be among the worst of times, perhaps the worst in 50 years, and that brings us back to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Speaking recently to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, investment advisor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> pointed out that the economy has grown at an average of more than 4 percent a year since 1982. That growth, he observed, has come not from a normal level of economic activity but from one that was extremely depressed. So far in the 1980s, the economy has grown at just a 2.5 percent annual rate in real terms. Unless the economy grows more than twice as fast as now appears likely, he said, `` the decade of the 1980s will be the worst decade for economic growth since the 1930s.'' Worse, it follows a decade that was n't much better. After 30 years of growth averaging more than 4 percent, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has grown only 2.5 percent a year for nearly 20 years. If this is prosperity, he asks, why are average hourly earnings in the nonfarm sector of the economy no higher than they were a decade and a half ago? _ Two other misimpressions of the economy, or aspects of it, tend to support the observation by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> that, `` half the truth is often a great lie. 1. It is often believed that until the big crash of October 1987, increasingly affluent Americans were becoming more active buyers of corporate stocks. It is n't so. Federal Reserve figures show that since 1968 households have been net sellers of stock in all but one year. In that time, the percentage of household financial assets held as stocks has fallen to 19.6 percent from 43.4 percent. Following the 1987 debacle, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> sought reasons why the impact did n't spread, as forecast. One finding, startling to many people at the time, was that so few families owned any stock. 2. An impression exists that housing has been priced beyond the means of most Americans, a notion that probably results from some of the so-called affordability indexes. It is n't true, and probably could n't be true for an extended period of time before supply and demand corrected the disparity. In defining `` affordability'' these indexes usually relate the median price of a typical one-family home to the median income of Americans. Median, of course, means that one-half the houses are below the figure cited and one-half the incomes are above the income cited. That leaves many thousands of households, each with ability to buy one of thousands of houses. None of these families is required to buy the median-priced house; smart ones might find equally good houses for much less. Some seek two-family units. Some prefer to rent rather than buy. They're not priced out; they choose out. The indexes are merely guides. When they rise, it is more difficult to buy; when they fall it is relatively easier to buy, assuming other factors remain stable. Money Magazine points out still another misimpression about our economic life. It announces that the common image of Americans casting aside their aging parents for nursing homes is largely a myth. It claims that only 6 percent of all Americans 65 and older live in nursing homes, while 70 perecent of the country's dependent elderly get all their care from family and friends. Do not despair if you held such notions. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> a long time ago: `` The ability to discern between that which is true and that which is false is one of the last attainments of the human mind.''

<HEAD>War-Weary Afghans Divided Over Role for Former King</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One name arises more than any other in the pursuit of a peaceful settlement of the 11-year-old civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, the king who was ousted in 1973 after 40 years on the throne. Almost all the parties involved in the conflict between the communist government and Moslem guerrillas have reasons both to accept him and reject him. The 74-year-old former monarch, now living in exile in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, has said he is willing to serve his people if they want him. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> has proposed <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> repeatedly as the only neutral figure who could head a temporary, transitional administration if hostilities cease. But the mujahedeen rebels _ Islamic `` holy warriors'' _ are deeply divided over what role, if any, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> should play in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Seven allied mujahedeen parties based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have formed their own Afghan government-in-exile, or `` interim'' government, but it excludes eight, smaller rebel groups based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The most radical Moslem rebel groups have branded <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> a traitor who let Soviet influence flourish during his reign. They claim the Soviets gained a toehold through extensive financial investment in the country's infrastructure and that this eventually led to the Soviet military invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. But delegations of mujahedeen field commanders, many from the royalist stronghold of southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, have issued calls for the return of the king. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON>'s rule ended when <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s fledgling Marxist parties rallied behind his cousin, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, who toppled him in a bloodless coup. But when <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> tried to distance himself from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, his former communist allies, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, killed him in 1978 and seized power. The coup set off a widespread insurgency that included royalists, Moslem fundamentalists and tribal leaders. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent its forces in 1979 to replace one People's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government with another, but it failed to put down the rebellion. The Soviets withdrew the last of their combat forces last Feb. 15. `` <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> takes a very grave risk of being shot if he returns to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nawab </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group, one of the most powerful. `` The mujahedeen will not let <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> come to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, a spokesman of the guerrillas' interim government, said the former king's return `` would mean the mujahedeen and the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are defeated.'' However, in July 1987, a prominent Afghan intellectual and author, <PERSON> Sayd </PERSON> <PERSON> Majrooh </PERSON>, asked a random sampling of 2,000 Afghan refugees among more than 3 million who reside in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> whom they preferred as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s leader and 71 percent replied they favored <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>. The royalists among the mujahedeen, most notably the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> led by <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, say the former king is the only Afghan able to rally warring factions. <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>'s group, said <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> embodies the Afghans' strong respect for traditions. `` The most important thing is tradition,'' <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON> added. `` Not just anyone can come and claim a leadership role in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. No one else has emerged during these last 11 or 12 years as a unifying force.'' But <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> will not return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> until President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is out of power. He said that if the <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> were to head a transitional administration, he would convene a grand council to oversee elections and then step aside. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has channeled millions of dollars' worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to the mujahedeen, professes impartiality to a political settlement of the Afghan war. However, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s policies often have coincided with those rebel groups who say they will settle for nothing less than an all-Islamic Afghan government. `` The <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> option is no option,'' Gen. <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON>, chief of staff of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s army, said at a news conference. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has acknowledged it sent envoys to talk to <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> twice in September. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> leader and a major recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid, called the meetings a sellout to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intended to blunt the Moslem fundamentalists' power in any future Afghan government. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts are in fact aimed at suppressing the Islamic resurgence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as well as in other countries, pursuing the policy of ` nip the evil in the bud' so that the wave of Islamic reawakening throughout the world can be contained,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said in a press statement. The hardline mujahedeen groups claim <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> watched silently in luxurious exile as Soviet troops invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. `` He never cared about the jihad -LRB- holy war -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, the `` interim'' government spokesman. `` He never participated practically.''

 There is a booming new marketplace for comedy in the tradition of vaudeville and the coffeehouses and cafes of the mid-century. Comedy clubs are drawing a million people a month and $ 500 million a year. They are also serving as a farm system for television's growing demand for comics.

 Call it a laughter explosion. Ten years ago there were fewer than 20 comedy clubs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Today there are some 225 of them out there, dedicated to making people laugh for a $ 10 to $ 20 cover charge and the price of a drink or two. It's a growth rate of nine clubs a year for the last quarter of a century. And thousands of comics are laughing their way to the bank. They can find work on some 700 stages where comics are featured, not to mention the growing number of comedy shows on television. It's a $ 500 million-a-year business that draws a million people a month and shows no sign of abating. The comedy clubs have become a vast farm system for television's insatiable appetite for talent There are an estimated 10,000 working comedians vying for the stage. Home Box Office is beginning a 24-hour cable comedy channel in November, and <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> has one in the planning stage. For the thousands of comics out there, they would become huge showcases for talent. Headliners at comedy clubs are paid as much as $ 10,000 a week. In the big-time halls, with seating in the thousands, headliners can draw $ 100,000 a week. Not bad in a business in which most start at about $ 25 a night. Naturally, few make it to the top. Once there was vaudeville, which gave birth to the likes of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>. Then there were the coffeehouses and cafes that spawned the likes of <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. Then, in 1963, <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and his wife opened <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s first comedy club, the Improvisation. When they divorced, she kept the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> showcase, and he opened the Improvisation in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and now heads a chain of Improvs. Whether it is the <ORGANIZATION> Punch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and nine Punch Line franchises in other Southern cities, or the Laff Stop in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, or the Funny Bone in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, or <PERSON> Byfield </PERSON>'s and Zanies in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, or the Holy City Zoo in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, or Comedy Underground in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, or the Comedy Connection in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, or the Comedy Store in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, or <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, or any of half a dozen Catch A Rising Stars from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the stream of talent seems endless. The comedy clubs are places where young comics can hone their talents before a live audience. They also offer a mirror for the changing face of humor. For instance: Sex jokes are passe. They do n't shock audiences anymore. So now the young comics play games with personal relationships, the blurring of sexual roles and distinctions. Mother-in-law jokes are out, but mothers and fathers make great material. This glittering city, where they say good luck instead of good morning, is one of the brightest beacons for young comics on the make. It has helped launch many of them to stardom: <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenuta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> to name a few. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> is a striking redhead from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. She has been aping other people's accents since she put on her own sidewalk shows as an 8-year-old, tap dancing to `` How High the Moon'' and singing `` <PERSON> Chattanooga </PERSON> <PERSON> Choo </PERSON> <PERSON> Choo </PERSON>,'' songs her father taught her. On one particular night she is winding up a week at Catch A Rising Star, an opulent club room in the Bally Resort Hotel on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. She has the audience, most of them sitting on sofa-like seats, hanging on her every word. She is the daughter of a retired Irish cop and an <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> mother, she says. `` That's why I drink a lot and kill people.'' It is the rare comic who is over 40 these days. <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> says she is `` a good 28.'' And the lines roll on, jesting at family, anyone's; quartering religion, anyone's. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, who says he has the only comedy-only public relations agency in the country, says when you publicize actors you emphasize the physical, the hair, the looks. `` But when you publicize the comedian, it's the vanity of the mind. These people think, they observe. They're going to tell you what you already know, but you're going to think you thought of it for the very first time, and you'll laugh. `` You ca n't teach an actor to be a comic, but you can teach a comic how to act.'' Twice a year comics get together, at the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in July and the Comedy Convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Established comics take the stages in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, and up-and-comers are showcased in <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Some 200 comics from all over the world go to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> expenses-paid. The Las Vegas show plops hopefuls in front of the powerful people who hire.

 Then the comics have their own affair on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, have had for the last three years, proceeds going to the nation's homeless. This year's hosts were <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>. The show is called, what else, `` Comic Relief.'' Some 110 of the comic clubs subscribe to a New York-published handout for guests, patterned after Broadway's Playbill, called LaughTrack. It is the product of <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who says it brings in several million dollars a year, gross. It supplies a number of short features on comedy and comics. In March it took notice of the heart-attack death at age 40 of comedian <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakes </PERSON> in 1987, and noted in retrospect some of his ironic humor seen and heard on the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> show: `` I know when I die, I'm going to hell. I know it's hot down there. But is it humid? Because a dry heat I can take, but that humidity, that'll kill you. And what about heaven? Is every day the same, or should I bring a light jacket?'' Once <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> remembered asking his father, `` We're born, we live and we die. So what is the purpose of life?'' His father answered, `` <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, tax purposes.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, who took Catch A Rising Star public and just sold his original Catch for more than a million shares in the new company, is expanding. Catch has an agreement with Hyatt Hotels and <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> to open clubs in some of those establishments. It already has a free-standing Catch in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and clubs in Hyatt Hotels in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The suburban and university locations are not by chance. Fields says they are targeting areas with high concentrations of tourists and relatively young, upper middle-class people. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> may be next on the Catch list, and Fields says he is looking at locations in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Las Vegas' Catch should gross just under $ 2 million a year at this point, he says. While it does not act as agent for young comics, Catch's other function is to manage their careers for from 15 percent to 20 percent of the gross. It can offer them booking at a number of clubs and promotion and exposure to the TV and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, who runs <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>'s at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, says her 150-seat room grosses over $ 2 million a year, by running nearly full three nights a week and selling out four nights. Cover charges range from $ 10 to $ 20, depending on the talent. The cover pays for the comics and advertising. But a lot of the talent that started with her in a small 87-seat room uptown are priced out of her market now, people such as <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dice </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. `` They're on to the next part of their careers,'' she says. Mostly she makes no attempt to censor the material, but sometimes she feels she has no choice. `` There have been times when people have gotten into AIDS jokes and I take a little offense to making fun of homosexuality in the vein of people dying,'' she says. `` I told one person to knock it off, I do n't like it, do n't do it. But, says <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, a feminist, they're up there making fun of women and everything else. `` That's O.K.'' For <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenuta </PERSON>, who started in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> blues club called <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> and now is on the road touring university clubs in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, religion is what works. Southern audiences love her, <PERSON> Tenuta </PERSON> says, `` because these people want to be spanked with a Bible belt, and because of my religion, Judy-ism, I shake them up.'' She considers herself `` a living saint,'' she says. `` Even though I came from a large Catholic family, I was always the isolated petite flower. I always heard voices and the saints talked to me. When I was little, I was kind of forced to play the accordion. At the same time I had six brothers so I had to practice in the closet while they watched the Bears game. I learned to play ` Lady of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>' in the dark.'' Each comic has his or her own material. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzer </PERSON>, a successful comedian now living in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, says his allergies are ignorance and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his favorite performer is <PERSON> Pinky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, his personal heroes are <PERSON> Moyshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. His most irrational act, he says, was registering to vote. His most irrational fear: the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

The squash harvested, he moved on to sweet corn, then tomatoes. Just after Labor Day, he started on greens.

The staff was impressed, but he brushed off their thanks. `` You ai n't seen nothing,'' he said. `` Wait'll next year.'' `` A little better organized'' in 1986, <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> donated 16,000 pounds of home-grown vegetables. In 1987, he topped 26,000 pounds. Last year, when the skies dried up and the sun beat down until the soil cracked like an over-baked cake, <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> harvested 28,000 pounds of food from his rocky three-fifths of an acre, all of it destined for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s poor. But do n't get the wrong idea about <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON>. Just because a guy spends 40 hours a week on his 69-year-old knees growing food for the poor, and urges others to follow his example, is no reason to brand him a do-gooder. `` I'm no <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>,'' he says. What he is is a veteran gardener who found himself face-to-face with retirement, a divorced father of four grown kids with no hobbies beyond the joys of coaxing fruit, flowers and vegetables out of the recalcitrant earth. As <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> sees it, his giveaway garden is less an act of altruism than an act of survival. `` I've known retired people with more money than they know what to do with, but they've had jaws down to here,'' he says, cupping a dirt-stained hand over his belt buckle. `` I started out to keep doing what I've always done. It was not, ` How can I help the poor?', but ` What can I do with all this? Oh! I will give it to the poor.''' Until a neighbor suggested a local shelter as a recipient of his bountiful harvest, `` I knew zero about the homeless.'' One might assume that a man who spends so much time toiling on behalf of the hungry and homeless would have pondered the matter, but, `` I really do n't think about it that much. It's too distressing. `` It's a national obscenity. I should n't be having to do this stuff. It's not the way the ball game should be run.'' End of discussion. Rather than ruminate about politics, he prefers to contemplate the heft of a cabbage or the sweetness of a lettuce, raising his voice to be heard over the locusts' buzz. It is difficult to lure <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> out from between the neat, weedless rows of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> chilies and turnip greens. Guests find themselves conversing with the muddy soles of his shoes or his rapidly retreating back as he strides off in mid-sentence to yank a weed or pulverize a beetle. `` He's very single-minded, but a lot of fun to work with,'' says <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON>'s `` migrant workers,'' 16 men and women who take turns helping plant, weed or pick. `` It's one of the enjoyments of my retirement,'' says <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, who signed up after <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> made an appeal at <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's not a believer, but he does have that instinct to do for somebody else. He comes to church twice a year, at the beginning to ask for volunteers, and at the end to say thanks.'' In the four years since he began, <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> has seen his produce become a staple on soup kitchen menus around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, the nation's seventh poorest city in per capita income. The city of 125,000 has two soup kitchens; a third lost its lease several months ago and runs a food pantry while searching for new quarters. At the Community Soup Kitchen, which serves 75,000 meals a year, `` It's hard to describe how much <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> means to us,'' says coordinator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>. `` Very often we get donations from all kinds of people, and they're all welcome. `` But what do you do when someone shows up with five pounds of tomatoes and you've got 200 people lined up outside? <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> grows food in quantities we need, and it's all first-rate stuff.'' The fruits of his labors were instrumental in helping the soup kitchen expand from soup and bread to full meals. The <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> delivers his vegetables, is at the heart of a network that distributes food to 350 agencies around the state. Soup kitchens, shelters and food pantries `` shop'' at the warehouse, paying up to 12 cents a pound to cover overhead costs. For the most part, the food bank subsists on throwaways from the food industry, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> is `` our precedent-setter. He grows prime, lovely produce that's brought to the food bank within hours of being picked. He stands alone as an example of how a simple idea can have a really big impact on people in need.''

 <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> has donated 100,000 pounds of home-grown tomatoes, beans, squash, peas, cabbages, lettuce, greens, corn and peppers. By his calculation, his three-fifths of an acre has served up about what the average home gardener might expect from an acre and a half. But after 35 years working for <ORGANIZATION> Asgrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which donates seed and fertilizer, <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> is n't your average home gardener. For one thing, his is a 10-month operation, beginning in February and continuing into December, long after the hardiest volunteers have succumbed for the winter. Last year, he called it quits 10 days before Christmas, after harvesting a hundred pounds of collards and kale. According to his careful records, the snow measured 3 inches that day. With an eye toward bigger yields and greater efficiency, he spends evenings scribbling in the large loose-leaf notebooks he uses to record weather, measure progress and plot strategy. `` Keeping track of yields is like keeping score in golf,'' <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> says. So far, despite the blight that wiped out this year's tomatoes, he's ahead `` You can grow an awful lot if you manage your land right,'' he says. Since space is limited, he starts most of his seeds in trays, moving them outdoors just long enough to `` finish'' them. By limiting the time each vegetable spends in the ground, he can plant several crops in a given spot over the season. In mid-September, he harvested turnips from the same patch that bore cabbages during the summer. In another section, kale followed collard greens, which in turn supplanted lettuce. `` Plants have certain limits,'' <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> says. `` When a squash plant produces a couple of fruits, it's done its job. The name of the game is to keep it going.'' One way is by picking off mature leaves and working them into the soil alongside the plant. `` If it does n't run into mildew, it'll go on forever.'' Dense planting is another way to boost production. `` You can crowd, provided you know how to compensate with extra applications of fertilizer and water.'' His three cats help with wildlife control, although insects still claim their share. Maggots stole 40 percent of last year's cabbages, but a dusting of organic phosphate saved this year's crop Chemical-free gardening `` is like riding a unicycle _ a neat trick if you can pull it off, but a hell of a way to get to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> discovered the joys of the soil while tending a community garden he shared with other graduate students at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he worked toward a Ph.D. in history during the late 1940s. When teaching jobs proved scarce, he went to work for what was then <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. Though he never billed himself as a plant scientist _ `` I've never had one hour of formal instruction,'' he says proudly _ his customers were free to draw their own conclusions about `` Doc'' <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON>. He spent much of his career as the company's advertising director, putting together seed catalogs. `` There ai n't no one around who takes better pictures of vegetables.'' To accurately depict them, he had first to grow them, a sufficient excuse for buying a homestead on 1 -LCB- acres atop a ridge in <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. The property came with a strawberry patch and a tractor with a plow attachment. Sold! `` I also looked briefly at the house.'' Many of the photogenic peas and symmetrical squashes that showed up in subsequent catalogs came out of <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON>'s garden, a loosely run affair where weeds flourished alongside vegetables. The garden `` was a source of food and relaxation, cheaper than golf or a boat. Growing food gives you the feeling you're master of your own destiny. It also gives you fresh vegetables that taste quite a bit different from the ones you can buy.'' In time, it became a laboratory of sorts, with <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> taking advantage of his access to the company's plant scientists and experimental varieties of seed. Later, as an Asgrow consultant, he traveled the country, advising customers and picking up tips. `` I have the sort of brain information sticks to,'' he says, `` like a Harris tweed suit walking through a burdock field.'' He'd always intended to keep working indefinitely, but heart problems and ensuing ailments persuaded him otherwise. Mindful of a friend who had retired only to die six months later of cancer, <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON> resolved not to make any plans. When he retired in January 1985, he did n't look any further ahead than the 20 75-foot rows of beans he thought he'd plant in the spring. Surviving four years has eased his fears somewhat, though most of his plans still involve next year's crops. Almost in spite of himself, the man who insists he's no <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> finds himself looking at the bigger picture. Under his tutelage, <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> volunteers are in their third year growing cabbages, peppers and beans on donated land. And last year, members of a Congregational church in <LOCATION> Woodmont </LOCATION> grew beans and cabbages on the church's lawn. `` I want to see a lot more of that kind of thing,'' says <PERSON> Liddell </PERSON>, who dreams of a full-scale community effort to feed the hungry, with a garden at every church and `` a station wagon full of church people picking up leftover vegetables from farm stands and delivering them to food banks.'' `` My days in this are numbered, but I could talk to people, explain to them, tell them what's possible. All that's lacking is someone who wants to do it badly enough. You also need expertise, but if you have the enthusiasm you can learn what you need to know.''

 <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> was content as a wife, mother and homemaker until a dream changed her life and led her to become a guardian of some of the youngest and most-abused victims of AIDS. `` In my dream, I was in heaven and God told me I was going to hell because he had given me so much and I had never helped anybody in return,'' she says. The result is a non-profit charity called <LOCATION> Proyecto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amor </LOCATION>, or Project Love _ <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s first home for newborns and toddlers who are not only infected with the AIDS virus but also have been battered, neglected or abandoned. `` I want the kids nobody wants,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> says. She and her husband, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>, who owns a swimming pool construction company, used their savings to buy an $ 85,000 home and half-acre lot for <ORGANIZATION> Proyecto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amor </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piedras </LOCATION>. Local businesses, civic groups and individual donors provided paint, furniture, clothes and toys. After months of untangling red tape with the health authorities, the home, which Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> runs with an assistant, eight nurses and two cooks, finally opened in July. <PERSON> Proyecto </PERSON> <PERSON> Amor </PERSON> is a cheery bungalow surrounded by palms and broad-leafed tropical plants, with a swing set, a slide and monkey bars in the back yard. The rooms are airy and freshly painted, the closets bulge with little dresses and shirts. Bright, new cribs sit in tidy rows in the three bedrooms. `` This is my bed,'' 4-year-old <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON> says proudly, hurrying over to a crib where he has left his teddy bears from the night before. <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON>, 11 months, were the first children brought to <LOCATION> Proyecto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amor </LOCATION>. -LRB- Their names are changed here at Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON>'s request. -RRB- Twelve more children, including a newborn whose drug-addict mother walked away from her in the hospital, are expected in the coming months. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, with a population of 3.3 million is experiencing one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world. Since 1982, there have been 2,940 reported cases of AIDS and authorities estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus. Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> met <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> on a visit with her church group to a shelter for battered children. At the age of 4 months, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> had been left alone in an apartment with two toddler brothers for about five days. She was undernourished and had pneumonia and a fungal infection. Blood tests determined that she was HIV-positive, a carrier of the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Police picked up <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON>, at the age of 2, wandering the streets of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, the capital's historic district. His mother was a chronic drug abuser, and he was found to be an AIDS carrier. He was taken to the same hospital where <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> was staying. They shared a room there for nearly two years, and now they easily play together around their new home, very much like a brother and sister. `` They've been together so long, they have to be together now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> says. `` It's like they're the only one the other's ever had.'' <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> was born to a drug addict with four other children, and she nearly died of neglect. `` She did n't smile. She did n't cry,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> says. `` When they told us about her, they told us she needs a lot of caring, she needs to be held a lot. She had never been held.'' <PERSON> Proyecto </PERSON> <PERSON> Amor </PERSON> is licensed as a shelter for up to 15 children ranging in age from newborn to 7. The <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> pays $ 2,000 a month for each child, which covers food, medicine and a $ 5,000 monthly staff payroll, Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> says. The Blays, who have two young children of their own, retain title to the <ORGANIZATION> Proyecto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amor </ORGANIZATION> property and pay taxes and utility charges, even though they do not live there. Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> says they plan to build on more rooms if necessary and did not want to ever give up ownership for fear it would become too much like an institution. `` I want it to work as a home, full of love for these kids, as long as they last,'' she says. <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> all appear healthy now, but medical statistics are stacked against them. Mrs. <PERSON> Blay </PERSON> says she is trying to prepare herself emotionally for their deaths. `` I know that they have a sickness that will one day bring their lives to an end,'' she says. `` But I have faith they are going to last a long time. `` The little boy and the little girl have told me they're going to run this house when they grow up.''

 <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is experiencing one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world. Since 1982, there have been 2,940 reported cases of AIDS among the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island's 3.3 million residents and authorities estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus. Among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, only <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reported higher per capita AIDS cases last year than the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rullan </PERSON>, chief epidemiologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, estimates at least 16,000 people, and possibly as many as 30,000, are infected with the AIDS virus across the island. An islandwide survey of households to determine the spread of AIDS among low-risk groups found HIV infection among one in every 125 people. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, a city of 1.1 million people, the infection rate was 1 in 65. The danger for children is that needle-sharing drug abusers account for 58 percent of the AIDS cases reported, increasing the risk of a rapid spread into the general population, <PERSON> Rullan </PERSON> says. Pregnant women who contract AIDS from blood-contaminated needles or sexual contact with intravenous drug abusers can pass the virus to their unborn children. A study in 1987 at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> found 1 in 60 pregnant mothers infected with the AIDS virus. Now, all babies born in the capital are screened for the infection. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Toro </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Fundacion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>, or the AIDS Foundation, says there were 64 cases of pediatric AIDS in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> by the end of May.

 Visitors to the old French colonial post of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are mostly businessmen and backpackers these days.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, once the throbbing capital of a vast French West African empire, has fallen on hard times. The atmosphere is still there. In fact, the place reeks of it. Palm trees sway. Beige and pink colonial-style buildings with wrought-iron balconies and flowering bushes line the narrow streets. Local residents in brilliantly colored dresses and robes go about their daily business under a tropical African sun. One almost expects to see pith-helmeted French army officers and colonial administrators step from the governor's palace, or emerge from an afternoon aperitif on the veranda of the Hotel de la Poste. More likely, however, is the appearance of a young Senegalese in his <ORGANIZATION> Adidas </ORGANIZATION> sneakers and running suit, or perhaps a Land-Rover filled with expatriate aid workers. Horse-drawn carts still clip-clop through the narrow streets. Their drivers, upon seeing an obviously foreign face, will insist at some length that the visitor needs to be ambulated someplace. The heart of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> is on an island in the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> estuary. It was from here that Gen. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Faidherbe </PERSON> ruled over a vast chunk of 19th century <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and `` pacified'' its natives. The island is connected by the iron <LOCATION> Faidherbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> to the mainland and by two other bridges to the Langue de Barbarie, a spit of land that separates the island from the waves of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> has been abandoned,'' bemoans <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Durande </PERSON>, who runs the 150-year-old Hotel de la Poste. `` There are a few tourists who do a circuit from <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Casamance </LOCATION> in the south and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Durande </PERSON> in an evening conversation over coffee in a hotel dining room dripping with atmosphere. `` Otherwise, it's mostly businessmen and a few backpackers.'' City officials are trying to spruce-up the town and make it attractive to moneyed visitors. A few of the principal historical buildings are being restored, or at least repainted. But the place is crumbling faster than it is being stuck back together, which in itself gives it a certain forlorn charm. A prime example of decay is the once-fine <LOCATION> Adamson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, named after 18th century botanist <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, author of the eight-volume `` Natural History of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>.'' The museum is slowly being swallowed by dust. Examples of typical Senegalese fauna rot in the display cases, skins falling away, stuffing ignominiously hanging out. Interesting exhibits of costumes, artifacts, tools and house-building methods of the country's many ethnic groups are falling to pieces, the explanatory labels frequently so yellowed they are illegible. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haidara </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and Documentation on <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> that houses the museum, can only shrug his shoulders and plod on with the little money that is available. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> was founded in 1659, first as a headquarters for French companies plying trade in gum arabic, ivory, leather, gold and slaves, and later a colonial and political capital. The English snatched it up on several occasions when <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> wars spilled over into <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ for six months in 1693, from 1758 to 1779, from 1809 to 1816. As a result, several <ORGANIZATION> Armstrongs </ORGANIZATION>, O'Haras and <ORGANIZATION> Pattersons </ORGANIZATION> are numbered among <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> families. When the Estates General met in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> during the French Revolution, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> sent its famous `` Cahier de Doleances,'' or book of complaints. It was supposed to be from all of the people, but in reality, according to <PERSON> Haidara </PERSON>, it was a plea from the French and the mixed-race population. `` I've searched in vain and not found the name of one true <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Louisian </PERSON> in the documents,'' the historian said. `` And the cahiers mainly demanded ` freedom of commerce,' which in those days really meant the slave trade.'' At one time, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> served as the capital of the colony of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, the capital of the federation of territories known as <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and capital of <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. The city lost the first two titles to <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, the booming port with deeper, calmer water farther to the south, and the third to <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>, built after independence in 1960 on a vacant piece of desert 200 miles north. Leaving the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, and its one stoplight winking forlornly in a particularly useless spot, one enters another world on the Langue de Barbarie, a teeming African world of bustling markets, aggressive colors and hot sand. The langue is slowly disappearing. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourang </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, says when his father wanted to walk to the sea, he had to get up early in the morning to get there by afternoon. Now, he says the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> is at his feet. That's a bit of exaggeration, but the land is wearing away. Turning south, one passes through the <LOCATION> Guet-Ndar </LOCATION> district, 900 yards long by 400 yards wide and packed with 18,000 people, mostly fishermen. The district and the people are poor. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louisians </LOCATION> consider them a crude lot. But the whole area is vibrant and alive, a contrast with the city, which seems to be holding its breath.

 Ever since she was a child and a bat flew into her bedroom one night, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has feared the little monsters. Now she's scared to death. It all began when she and her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, bought a century-old farmhouse in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, not knowing the attic was a roost for 1,600 of the night-flying creatures. `` I've never heard of this many bats in a house before,'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> says. At dusk, the sky blackens and fills with screeches as hundreds of bats pour out of the house, spreading their wings and dropping like miniature parachuters before circling back up over their roost and heading for the nearby <LOCATION> Chenango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to feed. `` I do n't want to go up there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> says, motioning toward the attic where the bats hang upside down from the rafters during the day like clusters of grapes. But while many people like the Whitneys are trying to rid their homes of bats, conservationists are working to save them. Bat experts say the winged mammals are vitally important for insect control, eating up to 50 percent of their body weight during each nocturnal feeding. `` Bats are some of the most misunderstood animals in the world,'' says <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, director of the Texas-based Bat Conservation International. `` They've been shrouded for centuries in myth and misinformation because they fly at night and are needlessly feared.'' Her organization educates people about the importance of bats. And with the return of <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> to movie screens across the country this summer, that job was made a little easier. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> says requests for information about bats has doubled. Even <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has been leaning on the Caped Crusader to help her deal with the thousands of bats in her home. `` You have to have a sense of humor about it. I'm buying all this Batman paraphernalia,'' she says, pointing to the bat sticker on the window of her black Renault. `` I tell my friends I'm driving my Batmobile to the Bat House.'' Bats have been soaring around the planet for 60 million years, at speeds of up to 40 mph. They're not blind but use sound waves for navigation and to hunt for Despite sensational accounts of people being bitten by rabid bats, such attacks are rare. Less than one-half of 1 percent of bats contract rabies, and those that do seldom become aggressive, said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. In fact, bats do more for us humans than we think. Many flowers, fruits and plants grown in the tropics, including peaches, grapefruit, avocados and bananas, depend on bats for pollination. The bat's instinctive radar system may lead to development of devices to help the blind. Man has also put bats to use in research for new contraceptives. A unique hormone allows bats to give birth once a year. The female is inseminated in the fall, but fertilization is delayed until spring, after a winter of hibernation. Even so, having hundreds of bats living in your attic is enough to, well, drive you batty. `` We've been fighting them for five years,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, who has 2,000 or so living in the attic of his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> home on the shore of <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> has spent almost $ 1,500 trying to keep the flying creatures out of his attic. But it has n't done any good. They can get through a hole the size of a dime, he says. `` I've sprayed ammonia, bought cases and cases of mothballs, and all it's done is stunk up the house,'' he says. His two daughters refuse to sleep in the house. They sleep outside in the family's truck. There are no exact figures on how many houses in the country are infested with bats. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> knows of about half a dozen homes where more than 500 bats have moved in and taken over.

 He says in most cases of major bat infestation, the houses are old with dark and poorly ventilated attics, something bats love. He says the homes are also near water, which attracts numerous insects and makes for a good night's meal. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON>, who works for a research arm of the state health department that studies rodent diseases, such as rabies, visits many of these bat-infested houses to get information for his research. Once he's finished gathering data, he shows the residents how to bat-proof their homes. And he does a little handholding. `` A lot of time these people just need someone to talk to and to tell them things are n't so bad,'' he says. `` They need to know that their house is not unlivable. They just have to get the bats out. `` I guess you could say I'm the living Batman.'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and her husband did n't know their house had bats when they bought it _ as is _ last spring, intending to fix it up themselves. Now they're living elsewhere. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> says she remembers smelling a powerful odor when she walked through the house and recalls seeing animal droppings. But she just assumed the previous owners had pets _ lots of them. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> says the bats were probably hibernating in nearby caves when the Whitneys saw the house and returned shortly after the purchase agreement was signed. The Whitneys discovered the bats when <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> peeked into the attic and saw foot-high mounds of bat guano. `` I was shocked,'' he says. `` They were just hanging on the rafters. It was like being in a cave.'' He went immediately to the county's environmental officials. When he mentioned the address, they began nodding their heads. `` They told me the house had been infested for years,'' <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> says that because the colony is so large, it probably dates back to the early 1920s. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> found bat guano beneath the insulation, which was put into the house in the 1930s. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a self-employed roofer and contractor in the <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION> area, plans to renovate the house himself. He says the roof will have to be torn off and replaced, and all the manure - and urine-soaked insulation will have to be shoveled out of the walls and replaced with new insulation He says the ceilings and walls on the second floor will also have to be removed because they're soaked with bat waste. `` It's not an unsolvable problem,'' <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> says. `` People are abandoning houses with bats. I looked at the deeds in the county office and they show that this house has changed hands a lot. I guess the owners discovered bats and ran. `` But there's nothing wrong with the house. It will take a total renovation, but it's structurally sound.'' The Whitneys, who have two young children, hope to move in this month. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> says the best remedy for ridding an attic of bats is waiting until they're out for a night of feeding and then seal off points of entry and exit. He says the best time to bat-proof is late fall through winter, when bats are hibernating in caves. He says bat-proofing should not be done in late spring and early summer because baby bats can become trapped inside and repopulate. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> says he's looking forward to getting some help in his private war from the <ORGANIZATION> Oneida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The organization is preparing a grant application specifically to get money to help people bat-proof their homes. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> says he's pretty much bat-proofed the living areas of his home. He says that before he did he used to get bats in the house all the time. Now he sees only a couple in the living quarters. But at most of these homes, the outside still belongs to the bats. `` You can get a stiff neck from watching them come out of the house,'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> says. `` It's like kids with a house facing <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION>.''

<DATELINE>MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here on this resort island in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, Jamaican waiters and Austrian cooks square off in a soccer match. Jamaican Independence Day is celebrated on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with a dinner party thrown by the waiters. Islanders still talk about the time a tureen of goat's head soup from the party wound up the next day on the serving table of one of the smaller hotels. Down on the wharf on a recent weekend, the sugary smell of fudge mingled with that of horses and cyclists and tourists all perspiring under an unseasonably hot sun. Above it all at the cliffside Grand Hotel, <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Champagnie </PERSON> smoothly waited tables by the golf course. Not a drop of sweat beaded his brow nor stained his white coat. He does n't mind the heat. In fact, he's quite happy. `` I like the work,'' he says in a thick Jamaican accent. <PERSON> Champagnie </PERSON> is among 32,000 foreign workers brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s temporary certification program to take jobs some employers claim Americans either ca n't or wo n't fill. These legal aliens cut <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sugar cane, pick <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> apples and, in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, they wait upon the mostly white, rich tourists at the Grand Hotel on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Federal overseers acknowledge the program is a target for legal suits from any number of contestants _ including displaced <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and advocates for foreign laborers. `` Court cases go hand-in-hand with this program,'' said one administrator, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruening </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. This year, for instance, apple growers in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were ordered to pay more than $ 2 million in back wages to 10,000 underpaid Jamaican field hands. Yet employers such as the Grand Hotel swear by the program. Service at the impeccable Grand was getting, well, sloppy, before the Jamaicans arrived, says owner <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Musser </PERSON>. Ten years ago, the hotel was hiring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> college students who cared little about what to do with the wine cork. `` I think our service showed it, dramatically,'' <PERSON> Musser </PERSON> says. Even that kind of help was hard to find. Eight people answered the hotel's advertisement in a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspaper offering $ 3.35 an hour minimum to waiters, waitresses and chambermaids. Five of the American applicants were hired. Only two showed up for work, <PERSON> Musser </PERSON> says. `` Every year we try to recruit, but it is very difficult,'' he says. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the Grand's headwaiter, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON>, sifted through thousands of applications for the same jobs. The 123 Jamaican waiters, Austrian cooks and Mexican maids the Grand Hotel hired not only wanted the seasonal jobs, they are professionals who work the high-class resorts of their home countries the six months of the year they are not on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. American waiters are not that hard to find, says <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Borowski </PERSON>, head of human resources for <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s other large resort, Mission Point. But Mission Point does not recruit in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The hotel hires seasoned waiters from resorts in western <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` The supply is there,'' <PERSON> Borowski </PERSON> says. After seven years of using foreign labor, the Grand's waiters now are almost entirely Jamaican. <PERSON> Musser </PERSON> refuses to say how much his foreign waiters earn _ `` We like not to spread that around.'' _ or how much of their wages are deposited directly in Jamaican banks, a requirement imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Federal law requires that foreign laborers earn as much as their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts. And according to figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the Grand's waiters earn $ 3.35 an hour, above the standard $ 2.52, but the hotel's no-tipping policy eliminates the standard gratuity. Instead, the Grand waiters are paid $ 2.20 for each $ 40 dinner they serve. <PERSON> Champagnie </PERSON> expects to earn about $ 8,000 for his six months at the Grand Hotel, comparable to what he earns during the winter at a resort in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, where his wife and children stay. Someday <PERSON> Champagnie </PERSON> hopes to save enough money to stop waiting tables and open a real estate company. `` I took this for traveling experience, to better myself in life,'' says waiter <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaubault </PERSON>, 27, from <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. `` It's a future here, so I really work hard.'' The Grand's Jamaicans live as cheaply as they can on an island built for vacationers. Workers can buy their meals at a hotel cafeteria and the Grand charges its employees about $ 125 a month to live in dormitories behind the hotel, <PERSON> Musser </PERSON> says. `` Rice, kidney beans and soup meat ...,'' butcher <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Granning </PERSON> ticked off the usual shopping list for Jamaicans at <ORGANIZATION> Doud </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION>, the only grocery on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> ` And chicken. They buy a lot of chicken.'' Now the bellboys of summer are going home. The college kids who put on aprons and waiters' jackets are back in school. The Grand's Jamaicans leave this month to return to their native jobs before the tourist season in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> gets into full swing.

 <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> has shed her sexy armor for her new role as a plain, tart-tongued nun in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>.'' `` It's funny not to have all the armaments of looks, sexuality and sensuality,'' says <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>, whose last role was Sable, the alluring vixen on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dynasty.'' `` It's strange to work without the designer gowns and the makeup people and hairdressers standing by.'' `` I feel insecure that people do n't flirt with me on the set anymore.'' In the new comedy series she's an adventurous nun who reluctantly takes charge of a group of unruly orphans who have just driven out her predecessor. It's an uneven match as the kids quickly learn their new overseer is no pushover. She's tough and has no tolerance for nonsense. `` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> is not sexually aware,'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> says. `` It's quite a turn for me after Sable That's why it was so wonderful for me to do the pilot while I was still in ` Dynasty.' But perhaps after this I'll be longing to play a harlot. `` I'm grateful that people can see that <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> was an acting job and Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> is an acting job and that I'm both and yet neither is me.'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> maintains a home in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where her two daughters attend school, but she has spent most of her time here since 1985. That's when she became the glamorous, scheming Sable in `` The Colbys,'' a spinoff of `` Dynasty.'' The show folded two years later and she moved over to `` Dynasty'' to match wits with <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> -RRB- until its cancellation at the end of the past season. She did the pilot for `` Sister Kate'' last spring on a weekend away from `` Dynasty.'' `` That's the reason I could n't get a haircut and why <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> has a ponytail,'' she says. `` It's the only effective way I could think to do my hair. I wear the ponytail now. That's how decisions are made. We're in the rough-and-tumble of a sitcom. Television is just a very rushed process.'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> says if `` Dynasty'' had not been canceled she would have stayed with that show. She thinks <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> checked with `` Dynasty'' executive producers <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> before going ahead with the pilot. `` I really did n't think <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would pick up ` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>' so I took off to <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>,'' she says. `` I did n't know we were on the schedule until I got back to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. There were a lot of phone calls to every hotel in <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>, but I was in a mud hut. `` <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION> is a long way to go to get away from the telephone, but it was glorious. The Balinese do n't watch TV so they had no idea who I was. It was lovely to be with such friendly people.'' She took a copy of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>'' with her to <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION> in case neither `` Dynasty'' nor `` Sister Kate'' worked out. `` I was slowly working my way toward thinking of playing Cleopatra,'' she says. `` It's my private goal, it's my thing. It's a very hard role I do n't know if I would ever dare.'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> has come up with her own background for Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>, which she says she must have to get a real grasp on the character. `` She has to have had a damaged childhood to lead the solitary life,'' she says. `` She's seeking peace and quiet and the security of the church. She's taken her vows of obedience so she goes where the church sends her. But I think she likes working with the children. `` I was brought up by nuns. I loved them, but I was also frightened of them. I was nearly 35 before I could slouch over a table. Sister <PERSON> Philomena </PERSON> stuck a ruler down my back. The tapping of the black boot fills me with dread even to this day.''

 Behind any good female impersonator, there are a few good wigs. Not to mention an exotic wardrobe and a good supply of false eyelashes. Ask <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, star of `` The Lady in Question,'' the comedy spoof of 1940s movie melodramas in which he plays <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnet </PERSON> -LRB- `` That's Gar-nay, honey'' -RRB-, a brilliant concert pianist trapped in the schloss of a sinister German baron during the dark days of World War II. Before the play is over, <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> discovers, among other things, happiness, humility and a softer hair style. Turning <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> into <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnet </PERSON> has become an eight-times-a-week job since the play opened to favorable reviews last July at off-Broadway's Orpheum Theater. He depends on a trio of dedicated co-workers to help create his female stage persona _ <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, who did his wigs, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, who designed and are in charge of his clothes as well as the costumes of other cast members. `` I'm a creature of habit,'' <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> was saying the other day. `` My evening starts at 6 o'clock when I go over every line I say in the play to warm up my voice. I arrive at the theater at 7 and after chatting with everybody for about 20 minutes, I get to work.'' The makeup and eyelashes _ $ 3.25 a pair from <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mardi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boutique </ORGANIZATION> _ go on first. `` I've been doing this drag stuff for so long now that I get that makeup on quick,'' says the lanky, low-key <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>. `` I'm better than any woman in a fire. Then I guess I put my costume on and then my wig and then my hat. Then I'm off for business.'' A white gown, originally made for <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> by <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> two years ago, was the inspiration for `` The Lady in Question,'' according to <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> wanted something similar to a famous lounging gown the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> designer <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> created for <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> in `` The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Story.'' When <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> tried the gown on, he stood in front of a mirror and exclaimed, `` ` I see it now: An anti-Nazi play, and I'm a big Parisian fashion designer.' We laughed about it then,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> recalls now. The Parisian fashion designer eventually evolved into a concert pianist, but the gown remained the same. `` When you design for <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> you are dealing with the same things that <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> and other designers did for <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> says. `` These were not curvaceous women. They had shoulders and sort of straightish figures. In fact, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> comes pretty close to <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>'s original measurements, except for the waist.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> first met <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> in 1983 when she was hired as stage manager for his one-man show. Out of necessity, she began to look after the wigs he collected for many of his early shows done at the <LOCATION> Limbo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lounge </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>'s first venture, `` Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,'' moved off-Broadway in 1985 to the <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playhouse </LOCATION> _ where it is still running _ <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> came along. Since then, she has done all the wigs, most of them various shades of red, for all of <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>'s shows. `` Copper is <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' color,'' insists <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a cheerful woman who says she first became fascinated with hair as a child of the'60s when beehives and teasing were in. `` He does n't look good in blond.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> are big movie fans, particularly of films of the 1940s, the period of `` The Lady in Question.'' Their work is a collaboration with all of them making suggestions on what <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> will wear. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> will give you an idea of what he wants without taking your hand and putting it on the paper,'' says <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, who made sure <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> had a different costume for each of the play's six scenes. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> did most of the men's clothing for `` The Lady in Question'' and also shopped for fabric, shoes and accessories for the rest of the costumes. `` Then we worked together on construction,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> says. `` We built these costumes from a lot of things I found in shops all over the city.'' There are certain things that do n't change in designing, particularly for the wigs. `` We have to soften <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' forehead because he is a man,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says. `` So we always do little wispy bangs. And the hair is usually no shorter than the base of the neck because we want to make his neck look more streamlined and feminine.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> buys the wigs from a shop in back of a liquor store on 19th Street and then styles the long, flowing hair herself. There are 13 wigs in eight different styles in `` The Lady in Question.'' Most cost between $ 20 and $ 50 and are made out of synthetic fiber from the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> tried using human hair but it did n't hold up as well, and synthetics were able to look larger than life. <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> wears three different wigs in the show. He starts with a copy of a 1940s roll _ three large, surfer curls in front and rolled in the back; then a <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanwyck </PERSON> takeoff, and finally a loosely flowing hairdo that <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> calls his `` <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> wig.'' `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' first two wigs are very stylized whereas the last one is soft, to go along with the way the character is progressing,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> starts out as very hard-boiled and becomes more human as the play goes on. In the last act, when she becomes this giving, loving woman, her hair is very soft.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> washes the wigs periodically with shampoo and conditioner. They are dried under a hair dryer and then combed. Backstage at the Orpheum, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> has a little table where she keeps a hair dryer, shampoo, combs, brushes and assorted mousses and gels with which she touches up the wigs about three times each week. `` Sometimes wigs can be temperamental,'' she says. `` As they age, they are harder to deal with and start losing their shine. Wigs do n't last long. Usually after three months, they are ready to be replaced, and I have to start all over again.''

 Forty years after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> stood on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Oct. 1, 1949, and declared a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the nation is still searching for the ideal People's Republic and frequently at war with itself. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has much to celebrate this Oct. 1, its 40th National Day. Emerging from a long past of foreign domination and internal decay, it is a strong and independent nation, a world leader. The fireworks, flowers and galas marking the anniversary are deserved recognition for a government that has managed to feed, clothe and educate a nation whose population has swollen in these past four decades from 540 million to 1.1 billion, a fifth of the entire world. But the 40th year of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been chaotic and few people are in the mood to celebrate. It has been four months since the army crushed the democracy movement in a spasm of bloodshed, and martial law troops still stand guard to keep people off <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, focal point of the uprising primed by students. Any thoughts of a military parade such as was held on the 35th anniversary were set aside. No one wants to see tanks on Tiananmen Square again. Market-oriented reforms that have doubled the size of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy and vastly improved the lives of millions over the past decade are in serious trouble The conservatives in power have put a hold on new reforms until the problems of inflation, corruption and excessive growth can be solved. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who was the main proponent of reform, was purged because of his liberal leanings. The grand old man of reform, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 85, appeared recently in public for the first time in months, looking robust. He had been reported to be seriously ill. The government has acknowledged that after four decades of indoctrination, it has failed to persuade many of the nation's young of the virtues of Communist rule Since the student protests, time devoted to political education has doubled and tripled in offices and schools. The official press is again talking of `` class struggle,'' a notion largely forgotten since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> <PERSON> Renzhi </PERSON>, a 78-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who experienced the pre-1949 past and stood on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> proclaim the birth of a People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 40 years ago, speaks for many older Chinese when he says: `` I believe in socialism. That's the hope of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Yet on the same campus young students shrug off the hours of political education they are given and whisper that they know the truth _ that they live under a government willing to train guns on its own people. The many 40-year retrospectives in the media couch their impressive figures on economic growth with reminders that all this is due to socialism. `` Only socialism can save <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and there would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> intoned in its series titled `` The Rise of an Oriental Giant.'' Politburo member <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON>, in addressing Culture Ministry officials responsible for planning this National Day, had told them the events should emphasize that `` public order has been restored and people are living and working in peace'' after the quelling of the `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' on the bloody night of June 3-4 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He added, `` We should explain with convincing facts that only socialism can save and develop <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' There is much to be said for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s accomplishments since <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s Communists defeated <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists in 1949, driving them off to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Life expectancy, around 35 at the time, has nearly doubled to 69. Cholera, malaria, smallpox, plague and other infectious diseases have been largely brought under control. The nation victimized by imperialism and gunboat diplomacy now sits permanently on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in the place of Nationalist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It joined the exclusive nuclear club by exploding its first atomic bomb in 1964 and has independently launched 25 satellites since 1970. It has normalized relations with both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and, lately, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> without leaning too heavily toward either. Except for the Korean War and some brief border clashes with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, it has rescued the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people from centuries of civil and international strife.

 The economic strides are impressive. Coal production jumped from 66 million tons in 1952 to 947 million tons last year, rolled steel from 1 million tons to 47 million tons in the same period. Grain harvests grew from 113 million tons in 1949 to about 400 million tons this year. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produced 14,000 bicycles in 1949, 41.2 million in 1988; 1,600 refrigerators in 1957, 7.4 million last year. Foreign trade is now $ 100 billion a year, 100 times more than four decades ago. Foreign investors have poured $ 12 billion into 16,000 joint ventures and other projects. In 1978, the year <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> started his reforms, 10,000 Chinese had washing machines. Now 43 million do. In 1983 only four out of every 100 rural households had televisions. Now almost a third do. Rural incomes, at 545 yuan -LRB- $ 147 -RRB- per person a year, are triple those of 1978. Urban residents earn 1,119 yuan -LRB- $ 302 -RRB- a person, up 87.6 percent over 1978 after deducting price rises. Daunting problems remain. Illiteracy has been cut from 80 percent of the population to 20 percent, but that still leaves 220 million people who ca n't read and an underfinanced educational system that does little to encourage children to stay in school. The government says 60 million people, more than the entire population of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, live below the poverty line of 200 yuan -LRB- $ 54 -RRB- in annual income. Some in remote, barren areas depend on government handouts for survival. Forty years after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> announced the end to exploitation of the people, more and more people are asking whether the progress achieved has been worth the pain. A million people in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> streets this past spring demanding democratic reform attested to disillusionment with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which, like other absolute rulers, is tainted by corruption, privilege and disdain for the common man. After four decades <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still lacks a legal system that protects people from the whims of politicians and police, and the large majority have little or no control over where they will live or work. The Communist Party's claims to infallibility have long been discredited by its excesses and miscalculations. There was the `` anti-rightist'' campaign of 1957 that led to the persecution of tens of thousands of intellectuals; the economic fiasco of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s Leap Forward in 1958, which was followed by crop failures and mass starvation; and the tragic folly of the leftist Cultural Revolution, which nearly destroyed a whole generation of educated Chinese Optimistic Chinese point out that in the past decade under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> the periodic political campaigns against `` spiritual pollution'' and `` bourgeois liberalization'' have been far milder, with fewer arrests and less persecution than in the past. But since the June military attack on protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, followed by a nationwide crackdown on dissent, the mellowing of the masters seems less certain. The party in turn is demanding patience, saying it will put its divided house in order and guide the nation to prosperous stability if only people learn to forgo Western political ideas and consumer habits. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, set the stage for National Day 1989 by returning to <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>, the still-impoverished town of cave dwellers in northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> set up his revolutionary base in the 1930s and 1940s. `` We should carry forward the <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> spirit of self reliance and hard struggle,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. `` It will be hard to accomplish the socialist modernization drive without such a spirit.''

 Tears welling in her eyes, <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> stood in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Oct. 1, 1949, snapping pictures of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> proclaiming the new People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` He represented the hopes and feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' said the only woman photographer on the official rostrum that bright fall day. <PERSON> Hou </PERSON>, now 67, and her photographer husband, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaobing </PERSON>, who is now 73, had been with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s Communists since the famous caves of <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> in the northwest and took thousands of pictures during the 1938-45 war against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the 1945-49 civil war against <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists. `` We lived with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We fought against the Japanese. Then we went to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> together. I was so moved that my eyes were filled with tears when I took those pictures.'' In January 1949, after the Communists marched into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, then called Peiping, <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> was assigned as a photographer at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the city. By mid-1949 the Communists had seized <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, the Nationalist capital, and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and were swiftly moving southward. On Oct. 1, with <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> under siege and the Nationalists fleeing to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> announced the founding of his new People's Republic. <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>, who became <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s much-admired premier, arrived first on the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> rostrum to assure that all the preparations were in order. It was 3 p.m. when <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> pushed a button raising the new national flag of five yellow stars on red before a crowd of 100,000. He told them: `` The Chinese people have triumphed over their enemies, changed the face of their country and founded the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. ... `` The Chinese people, one quarter of humanity, have stood up.... From now on no one will insult us again. Among the dignitaries on the rostrum were <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON>, commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Soong </PERSON> Ching-ling, sister-in-law of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> and later vice-chairman of the Chinese parliament, and <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoqi </PERSON>, the president-to-be who would be persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Tiananmen, the gate to the old <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or Imperial Palace, was `` very shabby'' in 1949, <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> recalled. There was no elevator to the rostrum and the leaders scrambled up a steep stairway. Tiananmen Square, then enclosed in a red wall, was about one-fourth the size of its current 100 acres. Residential houses crowded the space outside the square now occupied by two massive archetypes of socialist architecture, the Great Hall of the People and the history museum. <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> said the street running past <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> was far narrower than it is today, and it took well into the evening before a procession of 300,000 people could pass by the rostrum and see their new leaders. `` The people did not want to leave,'' her husband, Xu, said. `` They chanted, ` Long live <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>! Long live the Communist Party!' and Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> shouted back, ` Long live the people,' in a clear, resounding voice.''

 On the surface, life is back to normal in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The tanks are gone. The bodies of the dead have been cremated. The buses are running again. The markets are bustling. Everyone goes to work. One of the few visual reminders of a popular, seven-week, student-led movement for democracy and the violence that ended it June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square are the soldiers at main intersections and on bridges throughout the capital. The government is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Oct. 1, 1949. But people are frightened. `` There's no law anymore, no legal protection,'' a college student said. `` They can just come and take you away.'' Many say they fear the soldiers, who the government says are here to protect the people. Others fear the telephone hotlines and the boxes in every work unit to report people. One man said anyone could put a neighbor's name in the box and accuse him of throwing stones at soldiers, and the police would come to arrest him. He, like many other people, tells of friends who were hauled away, beaten and interrogated. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents also worry about the miles of footage taken by the police and on cameras mounted on main streets during the weeks of demonstrations. Police now are studying the film, and many people wonder if their faces will be found. One old man, who said he was persecuted during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, was asked by a foreigner how the police could find one person in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s population of about 10 million. He waved his hand impatiently and looked away _ to show what a silly question he thought it was. He did not participate in any protests, never went to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, and even told young friends and colleagues not to go. Yet, he is fearful. In a room he and his friends once considered safe to speak freely, he now speaks in low, hushed tones. `` We have to be very careful now.'' A young intellectual who took a foreign friend to his home barely spoke until they reached his room. There, with a sigh of relief, he said: `` It's OK. You can say whatever you want here It's safe.'' But driven by a thunderstorm to the foreigner's hotel room, he was restrained. Later, outside, he said: `` There were many things I was afraid to say in your hotel room. Who knows? Maybe those smoke detectors are actually bugs.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the site of animated, open discussions about politics and the government in the spring, is virtually empty of students now. The start of the fall term was delayed until after National Day, to prevent disturbances during the 40th anniversary of the Communist takeover. But earlier in the summer, the graduating class was still on campus undergoing several weeks of political study. In contrast to their earlier eagerness, many students politely backed away from talking to strangers about political issues. The few who talked did so only in a remote corner of the campus, away from others. Many Chinese have learned it is best not to talk about the events of May and June. `` What's the use?'' said a student. `` People's hearts and mouths no longer are connected,'' said the old man.

 Underground economies _ typified by merchants selling goods on street corners _ are growing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, draining billions of dollars in taxes and other revenues from financially troubled governments. But peddling goods, often smuggled, from foldup tables on the streets is the only way many South Americans can survive rising taxes, eroding wages and entrenched bureaucracies. `` The only way to earn enough to feed your family is to be self-employed and ignore the government, its red tape and its taxes,'' said <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavares </PERSON> on a busy street corner in downtown <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, where he sells cheap disposable lighters and ballpoint pens, earning five times what he did as an office assistant. Even self-employed professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers and psychiatrists are going underground. Not far from <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavares </PERSON>' corner, a dermatologist in an elegant private clinic tells a patient his bill will be 50 new cruzados -LRB- about $ 15 -RRB- if the patient wants a receipt for income tax records; without the receipt, it's 37 new cruzados -LRB- $ 11 -RRB-. The underground network provides millions with jobs or extra income, but experts say the gross national product of many countries would grow 50 percent or more if underground economies were counted. The informal economy `` dodges direct taxation but uses public schools and roads,'' the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent newsletter distributed in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` It avoids massive paperwork, government inspectors and the burden of dealing with 38 government entities to make a simple business decision.'' The bank estimated `` an additional 30, 40 or even 50 percent of extra economic activities are out there bubbling away and contributing to a much more sizeable gross national product.'' Economist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrizzelli </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> sees government as the reason for the growth of the informal economy. `` The government, with its interventionist and highly centralized economic policies, is a virus that attacks the country's economic organism,'' he said in an interview. `` The informal economy represents the antibodies society creates to protect itself from this virus.'' <PERSON> Barrizzelli </PERSON>, who recently concluded a study on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s underground economy, calculated it was about half the size of the country's official GNP, put at nearly $ 350 billion The Brazilian government claims underground activity would raise the GNP by only 13 percent. But <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said at least half the country's labor force of 60 million is involved in the informal economy. Other Latin American nations report similar figures. In <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the informal economy represents 40 percent to 70 percent beyond the country's official GNP, put at $ 70 billion to $ 90 billion. About half of the nation's work force of 12 million is believed to participate in the underground economy. In <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, about half of the country's 3.3 million workers are involved in the underground economy, which would add 15 percent to 20 percent to the country's $ 7.1 billion GNP. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s $ 22.5 billion economy would grow 40 percent if the informal activity were included in official statistics. <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a private economic research foundation, said the informal economy in his country is a response to the mountains of red tape that discourage small businessmen from registering their operations. It also is a reaction to the protectionism enjoyed by large business enterprises, said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, author of `` El Otro Sendero'' -LRB- The Other Path -RRB-, a study on the underground economy that has become a best seller in nations across the continent. Throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the most visible signs of the underground economy are the street vendors who sell just about everything from flashlights, cigarette lighters and clothing to candies, fruit and popcorn. Others collect bottles, rags, loose paper and cardboard to sell them to recycling companies. They are people who could not find jobs in the formal economy or left low-paying ones. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Morresi </PERSON> is one such dropout from the `` official'' economy. He sells candy smuggled in from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on a street in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. `` It is hard to find work and when you do, it does n't pay enough to live,'' he said. `` I earn more doing this than as an employee.'' In <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> has made a living for 30 years weighing people on his scale near the presidential palace. He earns $ 86 a month, with which he has educated his nine children. <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavares </PERSON>, 30, joined the underground economy in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> this year after quitting his job as an assistant in the personnel department of a construction firm, where he earned the equivalent of about $ 100 a month. `` I wanted to open a store to sell lighters and pens,'' he said. `` But the taxes I would have to pay and the bureaucracy involved to get a license made me abandon the idea.'' Today he sells his merchandise, which is smuggled in from neighboring <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, and takes home around about $ 500 a month, a sum few wage earners make in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> where the monthly minimum wage is $ 75. `` Because I do n't pay taxes or pay rent, my prices are at least 50 percent less than those charged by stores selling the same product,'' <PERSON> Tavares </PERSON> said, claiming he makes 100 percent profit on each item he sells. But the biggest slice of the informal economy consists of self-employed professionals, who declare only a fraction of what they really earn, economist <PERSON> Barrizzelli </PERSON> said. The dermatologist in the <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> clinic, speaking on the condition of anonymity, explained his reasons for working off the books: `` If I declared all I earn, I would fall into a higher tax bracket, which would make it hard for me to make ends meet in an economy where prices rise almost daily.'' Inflation in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was 1,084 percent in the past year, and growth was practically zero. That combination of recession and inflation has hit many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries and is one of the prime causes of the growth of the informal economy. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, government figures show that in the first five months of 1989, industrial output dropped 3.6 percent, while GNP declined 2.4 percent in the first quarter. Despite those negative economic indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s newsletter said, `` energy consumption rose, employment levels remained more or less steady and there was relative social stability. The only explantion for this, the bank said, was the informal economy. Economist <PERSON> Barrizzelli </PERSON> said he is convinced the informal economy will continue to grow and thrive as long as free market economic policies are not adopted in the region. `` The informal economy represents the only functioning version of capitalism in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, because it is the only sector where supply and demand is a determinant factor.''

 A sizzling hot Corvette, a quartet of new Japanese luxury cars, federally mandated safety devices and an influx of four-door trucks from overseas top the new car and truck news for the 1990 model year. While consumers are admiring all the new sheet metal and technological changes for the new vehicles, they may find themselves hit with a dose of sticker shock. Prices for 1990 cars are higher, and part of the reason is safety. The federal government ruled that cars manufactured after Sept. 1, 1989, must have either supplemental air bags or automatic seat belts on the driver's side. Cars with air bags also must have manually operated lap and shoulder belts. By the 1994 model year, passive restraints _ either air bags or automatic belts _ must be standard for the front-seat passenger, too. All Chrysler models built in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, about 15 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> fleet and just less than half of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s will have standard air bags this year. Costs of the systems, which manufacturers often decline to reveal, could add hundreds of dollars to the price of a 1990 car. Each of the Big Three has blamed air bags for part of its price increases. In the truck market, importers were shaking in their boots in January and February, worrying about whether the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would classify their sport-utility vehicles as cars, with a 2 -LCB- percent tariff, or as trucks, with a duty 10 times stiffer. The department ruled, in effect, that four-door vehicles are primarily for passenger use, making them cars, and two-door versions are mostly for commercial purposes, making them trucks. That ruling had a direct impact on the prices of the imported trucks, which already had been hurt by a currency exchange rate that ballooned prices of their vehicles. The number of two-door sport-utility vehicles from overseas will drop substantially. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> is making just 3,000 of its new Corvette ZR-1 cars, which have engines packing 370 horsepower to push the sports car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds.

 Ethanol added to gasoline will reduce carbon monoxide air pollution in cities by as much as 25 percent, says the president of a consulting firm specializing in fuel blend quality control. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Downstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternatives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> firm, says that a 10 percent ethanol-gasoline blend burns more thoroughly, thereby decreasing auto emissions. `` In addition, it enhances the gasoline's octane level, which lessens the occurrence of ` engine ping,' or the knocking sound that results from using unleaded fuels which contain a lower octane value,'' says <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` A regular unleaded gasoline has an octane value of 87 compared to a 10 percent ethanol blend with a value of 89.5 or 90.'' Reynolds notes that auto companies are experimenting with other alcohol fuels but ethanol is the only alterntive which blends easily with gasoline and needs no modification of cars. Ethanol is derived fom agricultual crops containing sugar or starch. `` In the late 1970s, alternative fuel programs were driven by fears of being dependent on foreign crude oil. Today both the automotive industry and consumer must look toward fuel alternatives as a means for self-preservation,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> says.

 The little antennas with the funny corkscrew parts are more and more noticeable on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> highways these days, as manufacturers add cellular phones as options to new cars. Business people who ca n't afford to be out of touch have found that beepers and pagers have limited ranges, and to answer one, a driver has to stop and hunt for a public telephone. That can be tough while driving on an interstate highway somewhere in the middle of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. There are at least two dozen companies making cellular phones for cars and trucks. Some of the devices are powered by batteries and can be carried around. Others must be left in the car. A mobile phone can be used while being held, like one at home, or in its rack, usually mounted on the center console or transmission hump. Placing a call is pretty much the same as using a phone at home. The signal goes through a `` cell'' and then is relayed by microwave to its destination, whether it's another mobile phone or a stationary one. Making the call is getting easier. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobilenet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is marketing a voice-activated phone that recognizes two different voices and can dial and cut off telephone calls without anyone touching the handset. It also can be used like a conventional mobile phone. A tiny microphone, mounted on the post between the windshield and driver's window, picks up preset commands and places calls. `` A lot of cars in Fortune -LRB- 500 -RRB- companies have cellular phones, and company policy says you have to use them on the hook,'' says <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, marketing manager for GET Mobilnet. Some telephone numbers can be programmed in so the phone will dial it on a one-word command, like `` office.'' Safeguards are built in to prevent the phone from dialing the number if the word comes up in casual conversation. `` If you have your wife with you and have a girlfriend named ` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>' and you say ` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>,' you could be in trouble,'' <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said.

 In the old days, the AM radio in the big nine-seat station wagon would fade in and out nearly as often as the odometer clicked over another dozen or so miles. No more. Radio stations are different these days. So are cars and their audio systems. A car equipped only with an AM radio is a rarity now. Some cars come with AM-FM radios, cassette tape players or compact disc players as standard equipment. And there's everything in between. As Americans take more and more to the highways, so do their audio tastes. Inside any car on the road, someone's probably listening to some jazz, oldies, easy listening, gospel or head-banging rock' n' roll music. They also may be learning a foreign language or how to be more forceful in business. There's a good chance some of that is coming from a tape or disc player. Manufacturers whose brand names have been in living room systems for years are showing up more and more in cars an trucks. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bose </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aiwa </ORGANIZATION> and Pioneer are only a few. Many vehicles are coming with a radio, cassette player and four speakers as standard equipment. Others come with options boosting power, measured in wattage. All that can make the systems attractive to thieves. To deter them, manufacturers make systems that can be removed from the passenger cabin and stowed in the trunk or others that blend into the dash board. Other ways to keep the car's stereo system where it should be include alarm systems with window stickers warning passers-by or a registration system with an identification number on each radio, tape or disc player.

When he cranks his car up and turns up the radio, `` it's kind of difficult to breathe and swallow,'' he says. <PERSON> Hoffsaess </PERSON> has equipped his car with a system that can put out 143 decibels through two dozen speakers. Accelerating jet planes are quieter. <PERSON> Hoffsaess </PERSON> gets defensive when somebody challenges the wisdom of putting all that sound in a car. `` Who's anybody to tell me what's too loud?'' he says. `` I mean, what might be too loud for one person might not be loud enough for another person.'' The cost of volume does n't come cheap. <PERSON> Hoffsaess </PERSON> shelled out a cool $ 12,000 just for the stereo. That's about the cost of two well-equipped Yugos, each with an electronic digital AM-FM cassette sound systems.

 Read any good tires lately? OK, so the sides of tires are n't the most compelling reading. They still provide a lot of information that can help consumers be sure they have the right tires on their cars or trucks. All the words, letters and numbers on the sides of tires can be as easy to follow as the family tree in `` Wuthering Heights'' for a typical consumer. Each tire carries the manufacturer's name and registered name of the model of tire. Usually that's in big letters, sometimes in raised white letters. That's easy to understand. A little more difficult, perhaps, but also in large print, is the size designation. This can start with a `` P'' for passenger tires or `` LT'' for light truck. Then there are three numbers _ the tire's width in millimeters. After a slash, there are two other numbers, representing the height of the tire from the tread surface to the rim, measured as a percentage of the tire's width _ for example, 75. The letter `` R'' for radial, `` B'' for bias belted or `` D'' for bias only tires follows to indicate the design of the tire. After that is a two-digit number showing the size of the wheel it fits, measured in inches. Continuing along that line are designations of whether the tire meets the Tire and <ORGANIZATION> Rim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s snow and mud specifications, noted by the letters, appropriately, `` M & amp; S.'' The last bits of information closest to the tread are ratings for tread wear, traction and temperature. Tread wear is rated by a three-digit number, with 100 as a base. For example, a tire with a `` 340'' rating will last 3.4 times longer than a tire with a 100 rating under the same driving conditions. Traction is rated on an A-B-C scale with A being the best traction at 40 mph on a wet surface. Temperature ratings also are on an A-B-C scale with A being the most-resistant to the effects of temperature at 85 mph. Now the fine print comes in. Nearly all of the rest of the information is printed on the tire nearest the wheel rim. The longest section involves tire safety warnings about inflation, and what can happen if a tire is underinflated or overinflated. There are descriptions of what the tire is made of, its design, the number of plies in the tread and sidewall, whether the tire needs a tube or not and the loads the tire can handle. Also on the side of tire is the recommended pressure when the tire is cold. That information often is carried in booklets that come with the car. Much of that information is required by law. Other information not required in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> but included are markings for Common Market countries. The code includes references to load capacity, speed, the country giving approval and the tire size and type, all in letters and numbers. All the numbers may not be easy reading, but following the manufacturer's recommendations in inflation and care can prolong the life of a tire.

 Would you buy a used car from a saleswoman? <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> found the question intriguing enough to choose it as a topic to complete her doctorate in sociology at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I found myself wondering how a woman got into auto sales, something I perceived as an all-male domain,'' she said, after a female salesperson sold her a 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, a car the sociologist really had n't intended to buy. Her research showed that women car sellers ranged from 23 to 52 years of age; one-third were single parents, primarily divorcees; and more than one-third of the sample had school age children. `` A third of the women are married,'' she reported. `` They cited the support of their husbands in sharing the responsibility of caring for the children.'' Their previous occupational backgrounds varied, `` from so-called pink collar backgrounds, such traditional female jobs as beauticians, secretaries and housewives,'' to teachers and social workers, or artists and photographers. Many of the women she studied played out feminine stereotypes to sell cars, said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. `` They take on roles men expect of them _ the matronly grandmother or mother _ or they act silly or ` dizzy,''' she said. `` These are the roles that men accept and feel comfortable with.'' She found that `` some older men simply will not buy a car from a woman. They feel intimidated and uncomfortable divulging personal financial information to a female. They'll try to stump the female salesperson, asking her tough technical questions about the cars displayed on the showroom floor, queries they would n't pose to a man.'' On the other hand, women love to find women on the sales floor, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said.

 Some windshields can melt an icy coating, cut the sun's glare or resist shattering when rocks hit them at 50 mph. But there's one thing common to all windshields, and it can interfere with driving: dirt. But cleaning windshields may cause long-term problems if it is n't done properly, says a <ORGANIZATION> Fairleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dickinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> <PERSON> Haase </PERSON>, who teaches physics at the <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, school, has studied windshield wear and how light is diffused by the grooves and pits left behind by dirt or flying pebbles. Windshield washers and wiper blades may take away some dirt, but the abrasion may leave behind scratches that can cause problems down the road. `` They help you see in the short run, but louse it up in the long run,'' <PERSON> Haase </PERSON> says. The research, done during the last four years in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, showed scratches and pits caused significant vision problems in less than 2 percent of the windshields tested, while dirt accounted for serious problems in about 25 percent. He says it is n't clear yet if recent automobile design trends making windshields less vertical will help move dirt and small objects over the car or if longer wiper blades needed by larger windshields will hurt. `` The fact that the windshield is fitted is good. You have to get a better windshield washer,'' he says. The Volkswagen Beetle was the best, he said, because of its small windshield and short wiper blades. While offering no specifics, <PERSON> Haase </PERSON> says washers that spray a wide stream of fluid or those integrated into wiper arms would help.

 It's time to get your car ready for winter, and that includes what you carry in your car or truck. In addition to what's under the hood, drivers need to think about gear to cope with a stalled or stuck car in bad weather. Here are some tips for coping with a blizzard, before and after leaving the garage: _ Keep at least a quarter if a tank of fuel in the car, refilling it frequently. Besides providing fuel to keep the car's heater in operation while waiting for help, more fuel in the tank reduces chances for condensed moisture to get into the fuel system, making starting tough and running rough _ Let some fresh air into the car if you are stuck. Even though lowering a window a bit lets in a blast of frigid air, it helps remove deadly carbon monoxide and other gases from the car's interior Those gases can build up if a heater is operated while the car is stuck and windows are rolled up tightly. _ Stay in your vehicle. It protects you from the weather and is easier for others to find. _ Stay awake. Do not allow all the people in the vehicle to sleep at the same time. _ Turn on the car's dome light at night. It helps makes your vehicle visible in darkness. _ Keep a well-stocked first-aid kit, a flashlight with new batteries, a windshield scraper and brush, jumper cables and blankets or a sleeping bag in your vehicle. _ Take special things for trips in remote areas where especially severe weather is possible. That can include a shovel, paper towels, a sack of sand, a fire extinguisher and tow chains. _ Be sure you know how to operate jumper cables. Here's how: Move one vehicle close enough to the other, without touching, so the cables can reach between batteries without being taut. Turn off both engines. Connect one end of the red jumper cable to the positive terminal on one battery and then the other end to the positive terminal on the other battery. Clamp one end of the black cable to the negative terminal on the good battery. Connect the other end of the black cable to the engine block of the vehicle with the bad battery, being sure it's away from the fan. Start the vehicle with the good battery, then the vehicle with the bad one. Disconnect the cables in reverse order of connection.

 The temperature's beginning to drop, and in some places, leaves are about to begin their change to autumn hues. That means it's time to take a few moments and spend a little money now to avoid long hours of inconvenience and a big repair bill later in the winter when driving's less fun than it has been for the past several months. Here are some tips for getting your car into shape before the first leaves fall: _ Have the cooling system flushed if it has n't been in the last two years Cleaning the system and replacing antifreeze in the fall helps the car run smoothly in the winter. If the cooling system has been flushed in the last two years, have the potency of the antifreeze checked. _ Inspect the battery terminals and clean them if necessary Be sure the battery has a good charge. _ Be sure your vehicle is properly tuned A well-tuned engine starts easier in lousy weather and runs better than a poorly tuned engine. _ Check windshield wiper blades and switch to heavy-duty ones if driving in snow and ice is anticipated _ Get an oil change It only takes a few minutes, and many businesses will check levels of other fluids in the vehicle at the same time. _ During winter, frequently check the level of windshield washer fluid _ Before cold weather sets in, check the heater's operation It may get a little warm for a moment or two now, but that's better than starting a long trip in freezing temperatures and finding there's going to be no heat for you and your passengers. _ Inspect tires for tread depth and uneven wear Frequently check inflation pressure. _ Check the brakes, and remember that cold weather, snow and ice increase stopping distances

 For the comfort of the behind of the one behind the wheel, a Swedish automaker has some advice on adjusting the seat to fit yours. <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> offers these tips for `` sitting pretty'' while on the road: _ Move the seat up or down until the top of your hip line is just below the lowest part of the steering wheel. _ Adjust the seat forward or backward until the clutch or brake can be fully depressed without lifting your left buttock off the seat cushion. _ Sit completely back and adjust the angle of the seat-back until the whole length of your back is pressing against the back rest. -LRB- Sitting too upright puts too much stress on the lower back and upper thighs; leaning too far back puts stress on the neck and shoulders. -RRB- _ Adjust the lumbar support until there is a gentle awareness of a supporting pressure in the lumbar area. _ Adjust the steering wheel until your arms are slightly bent, with hands at the `` 10 and 2 o'clock'' position. The advice comes from <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moule </PERSON>, an osteopathic consultant and sports injury specialist. `` Despite the amount of time Americans spend in their cars, they have not been taught how to use seats correctly and therefore do n't spend the necessary few minutes to achieve the correct driving position,'' says <PERSON> Moule </PERSON> `` It's easier to blame your aching back on your car seat design, rather than take the time to learn all the benefits of well-designed car seating, and adjust the seat until it fits you properly.''

 Driving with the gas gauge on empty is n't a good idea, and not just because you may find yourself stranded. When too little gasoline is in the tank, condensation can form, literally watering down the gas that's there. That can cause starting problems, hesitation on acceleration and poor overall performance. -- _ Keeping a maintenance record for your car can pay off. In addition to being a handy reference if you want to complain to a service department about a job you think was poorly performed, the log can be a selling tool, too. If you can show a potential buyer that you have taken care of your car, there may be less concern by the purchaser of getting stuck with unseen problems. -- _ Here are some things which may indicate a problem with your brakes, according to Allied Aftermarket Division, which markets Fram, <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON> and Autolite products: _ A spongy feeling in the pedal. This may indicate that air has gotten into the brake fluid, making it less efficient. _ The pedal throbs when pressed. Throbbing can be caused by a problem with brake drums or rotors. Drums press against rotors to slow the car, and when the contact surfaces are uneven, throbbing occurs. _ Brake fade. The driver notices that it takes longer to slow from one speed to another when using the brakes. It often occurs when there is frequent braking during rush hour traffic situations. Heat is the most common reason for fading. -- _ Tough drunken driving laws are turning into good news for limousine operators, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> MVMA </ORGANIZATION> says about half of the revenues collected by limousine operators come from business uses, but lots of folks are leaving the driving at party time to someone else. It can be cheaper and safer for a group of friends to rent a limousine for the night, forget about parking charges and stay away from steering wheels after having a few too many, the organization says. -- _ What a difference a hemisphere makes. There are five vehicle dealerships in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, selling <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION>, Jeep, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, Chevrolet, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, Mercury, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, Cadillac, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, there are just three. But they have hundreds of service bays apiece. -- _ Households with more than one car in the driveway or garage are n't as rare as some may think. The <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says about 30 percent of all households in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have two vehicles and about 9 percent have three or more. -- _ Motorists who run red lights in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> may find themselves on something like `` Candid Camera.'' The city's police have set up automated cameras at busy intersections in the Big Apple to photograph the license plates of motorists who go when they should stop. Offenders could be fined up to $ 50, but no points will be charged against their licenses. -- _ The rebates that car buyers see advertised these days are n't anything new The original <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> offered rebates of $ 40 to $ 60 to each purchaser of a Model T.

<HEAD>Economists See No Recession Before 1991</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The economy will continue to grow through 1990, forestalling until at least 1991 a recession that many once forecast for next year, top business economists said today. Nearly two-thirds of the 72 forecasting experts surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> said they think a recession is not likely before 1991. A third of them said a recession will not arrive until 1992 or later. `` If the expansion does continue until that time,'' the association said, `` it will set a record for the longest expansion -LRB- in either war or peacetime -RRB- in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The nation's economy currently is enjoying record peacetime growth which will be seven years old in December. The longest expansion ever occurred in the February 1961-December 1969 period that included the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. The survey was being presented at <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A copy was made available here. In its previous quarterly survey last May, <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> found that 63 percent of the respondents expected the next recession next year. Now, only 37 percent foresee a serious downturn by 1990. In today's survey, 32 percent said the next recession would not begin until 1991, another 14 percent said 1992 and 17 percent said 1993 or later. Twelve percent said a recession would arrive before year's end and 25 percent expected it next year. `` At the time of this writing, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> seems to have engineered the much-awaited ` soft-landing,''' the report said, referring to the continued but slower economic growth sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> as it seeks to control inflation. `` Economic growth has dropped to below 3 percent, inflation is dropping and interest rates are easing,'' it continued. `` A majority of <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> panel members expect this soft landing to continue through 1990, with real growth at a level fast enough to keep the unemployment rate below 6 percent, but slow enough to keep inflation in the 4-4 -LCB- percent range.'' However, the survey responses did imply a slowdown in economic growth in the last half of this year. The forecasters' median growth rate for the gross national product, the nation's broadest measure of economic health, during the final three months of 1989 is 2.1 percent. That compares with a 3.1 percent growth in the first half of the year. The survey found a substantial majority expect growth to continue at about the same 2.1 percent rate throughout 1990. At the same time, the economists scaled back their inflation forecast to 5 percent for the October-December quarter, down from 5.3 percent in the May survey. The median forecast for inflation in 1990 is 4.3 percent. Progress on the nation's twin trade and budget deficits, meanwhile, was expected to continue. The economists' median forecast for the trade deficit was $ 110 billion this year and $ 100 billion in 1990, compared with $ 122.8 billion in 1988. The survey found the survey panel expects a $ 150 billion budget deficit this year and $ 135 billion in 1990, compared with $ 155.1 billion last year. The forecast is far from the $ 100 billion Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction ceiling mandated for fiscal 1990. Other forecasts in the survey included: _ Industrial production is expected to grow at 3.1 percent this year, slowing to 1.7 percent in 1990 _ Construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average 1.42 million units this year and 1.45 million units in 1990 _ Car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this year and before falling to 14.7 million in 1990

 <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it was forced to seek federal bankruptcy protection after failing to work out an agreement with creditors. Chairman <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said it became apparent last week that the company was `` at least two or three weeks away'' from an agreement with holders of its senior debt. `` That may not sound like much time, but they are critical days in our efforts to restructure our business,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` We decided the bankruptcy court provided a better forum for proceeding with our fundamental restructuring.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws on Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where most of its creditors are based. The petition involves only the parent company and some land developing subsidiaries of <LOCATION> Lomas </LOCATION>, which has more than $ 6 billion in assets and operations in mortgage banking and real estate finance. The action freezes payments on a total of $ 2.1 billion in debt. Hurt by real estate problems and a slow-down in mortgage lending, <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> had reported a $ 56.4 million loss in fiscal 1988 and a $ 304.5 million loss in the year that ended June 30. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said the firm's operations should not be affected by the action and he anticipates no `` material staff reductions.'' In June, <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> announced a major restructuring program that sought to reduce its outstanding debt by nearly two-thirds, from $ 5.7 billion to about $ 2 billion. The company already had reduced its total debt by $ 1.9 billion from the sale of assets. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> missed a $ 145 million payment on its senior debt on Sept. 1 and the creditors could have forced the immediate repayment of all senior debt. But talks had been continuing between <LOCATION> Lomas </LOCATION> officials and the debt-holders.

 About 5,400 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> steel plants walked off the job today after rejecting the latest contract offer. The workers voted overwhelmingly over the weekend in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wooster </PERSON> to reject the four-year proposal and strike the company, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichelson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1123 </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>.

No new talks have been set. <PERSON> Nichelson </PERSON> said union members' top concern was the company's pension plan The minimum pension for a worker who retires with 30 years' service is $ 592 a month The company had proposed raising that to $ 667 a month, but the union was pushing for $ 1,000 a month, <PERSON> Nichelson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> also offered 43 cents an hour in a cost-of-living increase and a pay increase of 25 cents an hour in the first year, to be followed by an average increase of 25 cents an hour in the second year and 50 cents an hour in the third year. There would be no wage increases in the final year of the contract. The average hourly wage at <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> now stands at $ 11.83, <PERSON> Nichelson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who presided over the growth of Casual Corner from a small sportswear shop to an 800-store chain, died in a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> nursing home. He was 71. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who died Saturday, and his partner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carples </PERSON> took advantage of a trend toward sportswear that swept the country and helped revolutionize retailing by providing easy access to the clothes. In 1950, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who was a buyer for the former Brown-Thomson retail store in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carples </PERSON>, a manager at <ORGANIZATION> Sage-Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, opened their first store in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <PERSON> Carples </PERSON> said sportswear was a new concept whose time had come when the first Casual Corner opened. `` It was only natural that people were dressing more casually and were less formal in their approach to life because of the move into <LOCATION> suburbia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carples </PERSON> said. `` Casual Corner was designed to appeal to that.'' The two men strove to create an atmosphere at Casual Corner far removed from department stores. `` We wanted to create something more fun than work,'' <PERSON> Carples </PERSON> said. `` And we felt we could create a store that would be really fun to work in and shop in _ where both customers and sales people coultners' fun.'' In 1950, <ORGANIZATION> Casual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> did $ 45,000 in business. In 1960, it grossed $ 2 million and in 1969 annual sales were $ 14 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers worked behind closed doors today to try to restart stalled talks over whether they can lift oil production and still keep crude prices steady. Algerian Mines Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON>, one of the mediators in the discussions of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, left early to return to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> for a legislative meeting. Hurrying to his car, he said he had no statement to make but wished his colleagues `` much success.'' `` We have n't agreed on anything yet,'' <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON>, told reporters. `` We're still analyzing the situation.'' <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> has been pressing the ministers to maintain their production ceiling at the current level in an effort to lift crude prices by a dollar, up to the cartel's target of $ 18 a barrel. But a senior Algerian delegate, who demanded anonymity, said, `` We are willing to consider an increase in the ceiling if that does n't mean a decline in the price. That is our basic position.'' Other countries want to raise the supply cap from the current 19.5 million barrels a day in the last three months of the year. They argue demand is strong enough to absorb the increase without upsetting prices. Ministers of the 13-nation cartel met for several hours Sunday evening before breaking up to try to resolve their differences privately. One official leaving the meeting said the meeting was `` going badly.'' `` It seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem,'' said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>. According to an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> official who did not want to be identified by name, a majority of the countries, including <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, want an increase in the ceiling. They are at odds, though, over how to divide up the additional supply. <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON> said he favors an increase in the supply cap, with the extra amount shared proportionately among all 13. Each would get a certain amount added to its individual supply quota. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> already are pumping beyond the quotas assigned them in June. A smaller group, including <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, wants to maintain the ceiling at the current level to ensure that the group reaches its price target. The ministers are described as very insistent on _ and locked into _ their positions. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> told reporters, `` We are still deliberating about the best way to achieve -LRB- our -RRB- goal.'' He likened the oil ministers to hikers carrying maps and compasses. `` But there seems to be some discussion about the route to reach that objective,'' he said. `` The pro, con and the handicap of the terrain are -LRB- being -RRB- evaluated.'' He said the objective is `` Point X ... Everybody agrees the one goal is Point X.'' He declined to say more, but the goal is certain to be the benchmark price. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> has predicted demand for the cartel's oil would reach 22 million barrels a day in the October-December period. The cartel's executive body, according to sources, has said prices could reach $ 18 a barrel even if the cap were lifted to as much as 21.5 million barrels a day _ but only if everyone agreed to abide by his quota. <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON> suggested the ministers had given up any attempt to solve the problem of finding a more acceptable way to divvy up production shares and set individual quotas. `` We should address the problem of the quotas if we can,'' he said. `` We will continue -LRB- the discussions -RRB- in the meantime from now until November.'' Their next meeting is scheduled for late November. In June, some ministers said they would try to settle the quota issue at this meeting. There was no indication when the meeting would end. Indonesian Oil Minister <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> said he would leave Tuesday for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The talks are officially held by a monitoring panel made up of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The other members _ <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> _ were invited to attend.

<HEAD>High Prices in Japan Cut into Income Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite a higher per capita income, the Japanese have less purchasing power than consumers in other advanced industrial countries because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prices are so high, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says. In an annual report released Monday, the agency estimated that prices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were 39 percent higher than those in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and 47 percent higher than those in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Its conclusion was based on a survey of prices of 400 selected items in the three cities. The survey showed that housing rent and food subject to import restrictions were particularly costly in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but consumer durables such as automobiles were not much more expensive than in the other two cities, it said. The agency said 3.5 ounces of beef cost 86 cents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and 97 cents in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> last November but cost $ 2.75 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. A videotape recorder, however, cost $ 471 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, $ 682 in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and $ 504 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The agency said prices of imported brand items, which should have fallen as the Japanese yen rose in value against other currencies, had remained very high relative to their prices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>. Because of the yen's rise, a sudden increase in Japanese domestic prices quoted in dollar terms is `` unavoidable,'' the report said, but the economic mechanism should work toward bringing these prices into line. The agency said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s higher consumer prices resulted from such things as government restrictions, consumer behavior and high land prices.

 Grain and soybean futures prices declined slightly today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting forecasts for good weather. Temperatures in most grain-growing areas were expected to warm up this week after a chilly weekend. With little rain in the forecasts, conditions should be ideal for corn and soybean harvesting and winter-wheat planting. Frost occurred in the northern tier of Midwestern states over the weekend and touched the northern extremes of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but the chill was no worse than traders had expected and had little impact on prices this morning. Traders said slack export business also contributed to the early decline today. In early trading, wheat futures were -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 3.88 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.29 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower across the board with December at $ 1.39 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 4 \ cents lower with November at $ 5.70 -LCB- a Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar tumbled in European trading today, pushed down by concerted central-bank intervention following the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to curb the currency's strength. Gold prices rose as much as $ 4 an ounce in morning trading. Traders said the intervention included the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> trading, and the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> early in the European day. Unlike previous central bank dollar sales, which have occurred in concentrated bursts, Monday's intervention appeared to have been deliberately spread out over a greater length of time, dealers said. The Swiss <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, for example, intervened more than 30 minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, one <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> trader said. Dealers said there is talk in the foreign-exchange market that the central banks may have to come up with new intervention strategies. As a result, the market was likely to remain timid, dealers said. Central bankers and finance ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations said at a weekend meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, that the dollar was too strong. The officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said they would cooperate to curb the American currency's strength. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar sank against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6130 to buy one pound at midafternoon, compared with $ 1.6086 in the morning and $ 1.5755 late Friday. Other afternoon dollar rates compared with late Friday: 1.9010 West German marks, down from 1.9495; 1.6500 Swiss francs, down from 1.6890; 6.4375 French francs, down from 6.5925; 2.1480 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1935; 1,372.50 Italian lire, down from 1,407.50; and 1.1765 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1807. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.77 yen in the afternoon. The dollar's fall triggered a gold rally. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 367.00 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 364.50. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 368.75 an ounce. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 368.30 an ounce, up from $ 365.50 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.95 to close at a bid $ 367.86 an ounce. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.33 a troy ounce, up from Friday's $ 5.27.

 The value of the dollar plunged in hectic trading on world currency markets today as the world's richest countries dumped the greenback as a way of showing their determination to block any further rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The dollar sell-off began in Japanese currency markets in turbulent trading which was later matched in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> markets. Traders reported that the dollar's plunge was aided by coordinated selling on the part of the central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Finance ministers and central bank presidents from those countries, along with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, on Saturday issued a blunt statement expressing displeasure with increases this year in the dollar's value, a rise which many fear will abort needed improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit A stronger dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products less competitive on overseas markets. The finance ministers, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the annual meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, pronounced their satisfaction today with the dollar's decline. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> said that the coordinated intervention on the part of governments to push the dollar lower was a `` confirmation and illustration'' of the resolve of the Group of Seven to cooperate on international economic matters. Some critics have complained that the G-7 coordination process was in danger of coming apart, given a failure so far in the year by the group to influence the dollar's exchange rate. <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>, briefing reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> communique `` meant what it said'' and he said it reflected `` the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in monetary terms.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen. The dollar later fell even further in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, president of the West German central bank, confirmed for reporters that widespread intervention was occurring and said that it was `` appropriate and reasonable'' given the need to make further progress in reducing world trade imbalances. Despite today's sharp plunge in the dollar's value, private economists said it remained to be seen whether intervention would work any better in the long term than it has up until now at keeping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency from rising. The sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are focusing on such topics as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration efforts to reduce a portion of the Third World's debt burden and proposals to assist in the dramatic political and economic reforms under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> officials told reporters today that there had been no final decision on the question of doubling <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> resources, although they predicted that the matter could still be resolved by the end of this year. While there is overwhelming support among the 152 nations for at least some type of increase, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has veto power on the issue, remains opposed. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Managing Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> insisted that the outlook for an increase still looked encouraging, saying he believed there was a `` growing perception of the weight of the responsibilities put on our sholders'' to help carry out the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's Third World debt reduction strategy In the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> communique, issued late Saturday after a day of closed-door dicussions, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and his counterparts from the other countries expressed their displeasure with the persistent increase in the dollar's value this year. The joint statement called the dollar's increase `` inconsistent with longer-run economic fundamentals'' and said a further rise could `` adversely affect prospects for the world economy.'' The Saturday session was the first meeting of the finance ministers and central bank presidents since last April. At that time, the officials had also decried the rising value of the dollar, although the language used was milder in tone. The stepped-up sense of urgency led many private economists to expect a heavy effort at intervention today. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, said he was also looking for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to show more willingness in the months ahead to raise interest rates in their countries as a way of influencing currency markets. Higher interest rates overseas relative to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreign investors. But some analysts said they were not sure whether the latest effort would be any more successful than the April vow to keep the dollar from rising in value. Despite heavy intervention in the currency markets since last spring, the dollar has continued rising and now stands about 20 percent above its January level in relation to the Japanese yen. It is about 25 percent above its January level against the West German mark. Before Saturday's G-7 meeting, the dollar bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks, well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading range sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks. `` The fact of the matter is intervention does not work in the long run,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> DRI-McGraw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. He and other economists said what really was needed was for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries to improve underlying economic conditions. For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that would mean stronger efforts to reduce its budget deficit, which drains away domestic savings and pushes up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, and greater efforts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to reduce their huge trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the administration was making strides in reducing the federal deficit and he called on countries running large trade surpluses, such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to do more to stimulate domestic demand and open their borders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. msc

 The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION>, starting from scratch in an attempt to buck the trend of newspaper mergers and shutdowns, debuted early today before a curious and eager community. The first edition of the tabloid featured a photograph of a bright sun rising over the Gateway Arch. The lead story was the launch of the newspaper, and its headline was `` <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, We Have Liftoff.'' The Sun is the first major newspaper to begin from scratch in a big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city since the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times debuted in 1982. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the Sun, is moving to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to become editor-in-chief. `` I think it's pretty clear that print has a good future. I have n't the least doubt the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> will be profitable. It's one of the lower risk ventures we've undertaken,'' he said `` This newspaper will be successful if it's relevant. That's our number one priority.'' To herald the Sun's rising, Ingersoll and other executives gathered at a sidewalk reception this morning at the city's downtown offices A Dixieland jazz band played in the background as Sun employees waded into traffic to hand out free copies of the morning newspaper. Sue Selvidge, a clerk at World News in downtown <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said this morning that the paper was selling briskly. `` Everygody likes to see something new,'' she said. Already, the Sun has attracted 55,000 subscribers _ nearly twice the level company officials had been aiming for after a month of publication. Advertising space in the inaugural edition was sold out. The Sun started printing 200,000 copies of the newspaper about 9:30 p.m. Sunday night, three hours earlier than its planned deadline, in order to meet expected heavy demand. The 1-day-old Sun will be competing with the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION>, which will be 111 years old in December. The Post-Dispatch has been the city's only daily newspaper since the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe-Democrat </ORGANIZATION> folded in October 1986. `` We definitely welcome competition,'' said the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON>'s managing editor, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipman </PERSON> `` We find it exciting and challenging.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>'s circulation has been increasing all summer and its 10 biggest advertisers are spending more money than they were a year ago. Last week's paid circulation stood at 564,000 on Sunday and 384,000 on weekdays. The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> took note of its new competition with a story on the bottom of today's front page that included this quote from Editor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>: `` It's a good-looking newspaper, but it's not a newspaper that was invented on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> or is the likes of something that people have never seen.'' Sun officials are calling the new tabloid a `` laptop'' paper that's `` user friendly.'' Although industry analysts are closely following the Sun's progress, they do n't think it will have that big an impact on the industry `` No matter what happens in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, I do n't think you're going to see many people rushing to try the same thing around the country,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, a Washington-based newspaper analyst <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said there are only 19 cities in the country that still have two commercially competitive newspapers, and it appears that number will be shrinking soon.

A year ago, the count stood at 917, the company said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.

In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500.

 Employees of the state-run television corporation went on strike Monday to protest a proposed bill establishing private television. The blackout, which was to last until 1 a.m. Tuesday, was the longest in a series of work stoppages that began Sept. 7 to protest the legislation breaking the state monopoly on television. Parliament was expected to pass the bill. The government rejected a series of employee demands at a meeting on Monday, said <PERSON> Sifis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakavoulis </PERSON>, deputy president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kakavoulis </PERSON> said one of the employees' key demands was that they be represented on a special council overseeing state and private radio and television. `` Another point of contention with the government is that the bill does not oblige private television stations to present any Greek programs,'' <PERSON> Kakavoulis </PERSON> said. `` This means that they will be able to present only foreign programs, with which ERT wo n't be able to compete.'' Foreign programs are cheaper to buy than Greek productions. The government has called the strikes politically inspired and said it would ask the courts to declare further work stoppages illegal. The employees' federation is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which lost the June 18 general elections after eight years in power. The elections produced a hung parliament, resulting in a conservative-leftist coalition that promised to clean up scandals from the previous socialist administration. New elections are scheduled Nov. 5 Private TV stations are expected to start broadcasting after the general elections.

 Grain and soybean futures prices drifted to a mixed close Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, where a lack of significant news kept the trading floor quiet and activity thin. Bearish forecasts for a week of clear weather _ good for harvesting in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and winter-wheat planting in the Plains _ were offset by predictions for frost later this week in northern growing areas.

 Striking workers picketed Monday near <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> steel plants after contract talks broke off Sunday and more than 5,400 people walked off the job. Pickets marched peacefully at three plants near <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> also has two other plants in the state. The walkout affects a total of 5,440 out of 7,000 employees at the three facilities. The walkout began at 12:01 a.m. Monday, when a four-year contract expired after a dispute over benefits and pay. No new talks were set Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>. Negotiations began in mid-August. `` I think we've sacrificed enough, and now it's time for our fair share,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Roan </PERSON>, a bearing operator who has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> 23 years. `` This is just a matter of getting what we think we have coming to us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Timken </ORGANIZATION> proposed raising the minimum pension from $ 592 a month to $ 667 per month for those who retire after 30 years' service.

<HEAD>Andersen-Price Waterhouse Merger May Be Scrapped: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The proposed merger of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Price Waterhouse into what would become the world's largest accounting firm may be scrapped due to differences over retirement funding, according to a report published Monday. A dispute over the name of the combined firm and various sticky legal and internal issues also threaten to derail the merger talks, the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting unidentified parties close to both firms. Neither Chicago-based Andersen nor New York-based Price Waterhouse would comment on the report. Some industry observers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that while retirement funding may be a major obstacle to a merger, the negative consequences of not merging are likely to bring the bickering companies together in the end. If the problem is combining retirement plans, `` who ought to be better able to do that than accountants,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The Journal said <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> accrues or sets up a reserve for its partners in advance of their retirement, and they generally receive $ 25,000 to $ 50,000 a year in benefits after they retire. Price does n't fund its retirement benefits in advance and pays its partners about $ 100,000 a year after they retire, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said many people in the acconting field were saying a merger looked unlikely, `` but if you had asked me a month ago, I would have told you they were saying it would n't work then, too.'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and Price will merge, largely because of what each firm stands to lose if they do n't. Without a merger, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounting firm, would be unlikely to regain the No. 1 position it lost earlier this year when <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> combined their operations. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> needs to expand its foreign operations, currently the smallest of any major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounting firm, and would be unlikely to do so without a merger, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiling </PERSON>, who resigned from <LOCATION> Andersen </LOCATION> last month as a managing director in consulting to join <ORGANIZATION> CSC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said that without a merger to strengthen its accounting business, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s consulting arm would possibly split off as a separate company. Consulting has been <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s fastest-growing business in recent years but the firm has been unable to halt the defections of its top consulting partners, who are unhappy with subsidizing the accounting and related operations. For Price Waterhouse, the No. 5 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounting firm, failure to merge with <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> would mark its second aborted merger since 1984, when merger talks with <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells fell through. <PERSON> Deloitte </PERSON> combined with <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. `` Two failed mergers does n't look good,'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said. Other hurdles <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and Price would have to overcome include a potential conflict of interest in their dealings with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to the Journal. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> has joint ventures with both firms to develop computer integration products while Price is the auditor for both firms. Accounting profession ethics rules ban business ties with audit clients. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and Price Waterhouse began formal talks to explore the feasibility of a merger in July. The two firms announced on Sept. 5 that they would need more time to continue their merger talks. A merged company would reap $ 5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and $ 2.7 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> revenue.

<HEAD>Governing Body Urges Members to Pay Arrears</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cabinet ministers who oversee the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that back dues owed by member nations continue to grow, and they urged repayment of the arrears to help ease the burden on other countries. In a communique after several days of deliberations, the <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> also said many of the organization's 152 member nations support a `` substantial increase'' in the lending funds provided by the institution. The question of increasing the lending reserves is one of the central issues at this year's annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which was to begin Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> is urging the member nations to double so-called quotas from $ 120 billion. Others say he will only get a 50 perent to 70 percent increase, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they believe the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has adequate resources to respond to the needs of poorer countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest contributor to both organizations and has the biggest voting share. `` There was widespread support in the committee on the need for a substantial increase in quotas ... although a few members believe that the Fund has adequate resources at the present time to fulfill its responsibilities,'' said the statement issued at the end of the panel's deliberations. The committee called for a decision to be made on the proposed increases by the end of the year. The panel welcomed `` the significant reduction in the number of members in arrears.'' But is also was `` concerned that the overall amount of arrears had nonetheless continued to rise, owing to the failure of a few countries with protracted arrears to meet their financial obligations.'' The back dues to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> totaled $ 3.75 billion at the end of September, compared with $ 2.37 billion at the same time last year. Those with the longest back dues, which have been declared ineligible for further lending until they repay some of the money, are <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. `` The committee again called on all members in arrears to adopt policies promptly to correct their economic imbalances and regularize their relations with the fund, bearing in mind the burden that overdue obligations impose on other fund members,'' the statement said.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had made the last major asset sale under a $ 5.5 billion divestiture plan as an investor group led by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy its <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> canned food business for $ 1.48 billion. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON>'s senior management, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kikkoman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also are members of the investor group. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> said proceeds from the sale will bring to approximately $ 4.9 billion the amount of money it has earned from its divestiture program. The company began selling assets to reduce its debt following the record $ 24.53 billion buyout of the food and tobacco giant by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheckler </PERSON>, who analyzes <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the asset sales are `` proceeding well'' and that the prices <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> has received were generally in line with expectations. The company previously announced the sale of five European food businesses for $ 2.5 billion; its Chun King food division for $ 52 million; its <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 44 million; and the fresh fruit operations of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> for $ 875 million. `` We do n't anticipate that there will be any more major divestitures,'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management would look at the company's businesses individually and decide where it could make further cuts, <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Sheckler </PERSON> said she expected <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> to sell individual grocery product lines to achieve its goal of $ 5.5 billion. There had been speculation that <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> might sell its <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LifeSavers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but the company apparently plans to retain the division. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to sell <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION>'s canned food business to a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>. However, the company was forced to revamp the deal after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s staff expressed concern that the transaction did not comply with regulations limiting banks' ownership of nonfinancial companies. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> was forced to reduce its stake in the <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> holdings because federal banking rules prohibit banks from owning more than 5 percent of voting stock and 25 percnet of non-voting stock in non-financial firms. Businesses included in the latest sale included <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON>'s processed food business in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the Far East and its pineapple operations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> said it would keep Del Monte-Aylmer <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION>'s processed food business in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> food businesses in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that had been managed by <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON>.

 A unit of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has offered to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s non-communist government privatize its economy, including creating a new financial system, a bank official said Monday. Sir <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryrie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the bank's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he made the offer Sunday to Polish Finance Minister <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> IFC </ORGANIZATION> is the section of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that deals with private enterprise rather than government. `` Other groups are talking about help to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> IFC </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be named. `` We're making a concrete proposal.'' Such a venture poses problems, <PERSON> Ryrie </PERSON> said at a news conference at which he discussed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` You have economies which are entirely state owned and controlled, now trying to make the transition and it's a very difficult transition to make,'' he said. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> said he had seen the economic plan of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s non-communist government, but that it was too soon to comment on it. One major problem is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 42 billion debt, three-quarters of which is owed to governments rather than private banks. Creditor governments are being asked to postpone payments due this year and next. The <ORGANIZATION> IFC </ORGANIZATION> program calls for new private foreign investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, especially joint ventures between foreign investors and Polish interests. It also offers to help on privatizing state-owned enterprises, creation of a new bank or banks to provide a base for more private companies, and help in developing capital markets. <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> represents <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as one of the 152 governments that own the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Checchi Told to Cut KLM Investment in Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has asked <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> to sharply reduce the $ 400 million investment made in the carrier by <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, according to a published report Monday. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> made the request in a meeting last Friday where <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> his conclusions from a review of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s financial health, The Wall Street Journal reported. The newspaper, quoting two unidentified sources, said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> had no comment. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> has disclosed <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s findings, which are expected to made public later this week. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> made the investment to help <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> finance the $ 3.65 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. Although foreign companies can not own more than 25 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> provided 57 percent of the $ 700 million in equity <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> raised to buy Northwest. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> officially owns only 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> because its investment is mostly in nonvoting preferred stock. One person familiar with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s decisions said he wants to cut <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in Northwest from $ 400 million to $ 175 million, an amount equal to 25 percent of the $ 700 million in equity <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> raised, the Journal reported. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have expressed concern about the foreign interest in recent airline takeovers and the level of debt carriers are being forced to assume. Foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines raises concerns about national security, competition and bilateral negotiations on international routes, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has said. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> declined to comment Monday on the newspaper report. Northwest also has declined to disclose what <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> last week.

 A show of strength by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> major industrial companies sent the dollar sliding Monday. Gold prices moved higher. Several central banks, including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, sold dollars against major foreign currencies to bring the dollar down sharply from its recent high levels. The dollar regained some ground late in the day, but dealers said trading was nervous after a weekend meeting in which Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank chiefs said they were determined to keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency from rising. `` They're trying to show some muscle,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior currency trader with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the seven nations. `` The market is wondering who's going to win the battle.'' In a strongly worded communique, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said `` a rise in the dollar above current levels, or an excessive decline, could affect prospects for the world economy.'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, predicted `` the market is going to be nervous going long'' because traders are concerned about continued central bank intervention and possible interest rate hikes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. When interest rates rise overseas, the dollar tends to fall if the increases are not matched in this country. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said some dollar traders expect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth to slow and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to relax interest rates here. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> led Monday's market intervention, and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> also sold dollars in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also intervened in later trading, as did the British, West German, French and Swiss central banks, they said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.69 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it skidded to 142.13 yen from late Friday's 146.05. The dollar also plummeted against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6080 to buy one pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, more expensive than $ 1.5755 late Friday. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound was quoted at $ 1.6175, compared with late Friday's $ 1.5715.

Gold advanced earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 367 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 364.50.

 Animal-rights activists said Monday they are beginning a nationwide boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to pressure the company into stopping the use of animals in product safety tests. The giant consumer products company said it has been studying alternatives but that there are n't sufficient methods available to make the elimination of animal tests possible. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazard </PERSON>, executive director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Doris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, met with company representatives at <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters to present her group's demands, but said later she was disappointed with the results. She told a news conference earlier Monday that 36,000 of the Doris Day League's members nationwide have returned cards indicating they will support the boycott. The group accuses the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G of needlessly torturing rabbits and other animals in laboratory tests in which cosmetics and other products are forced into the eyes to document exposure risks. P & amp; G, which manufactures a wide range of products from <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> toothpaste to Pampers disposable diapers, had $ 21.4 billion in worldwide sales during the past year. The Doris Day group and other animal-rights associations, including In <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> and People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, say the tests are cruel, unnecessary and produce irrelevant data that could be replaced by more humane tests. Ms. Hazard said <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G representatives turned down her requests Monday to provide data on the number of animals used in testing and would not commit the company to support bills before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designed to phase out the use of animals in testing. She said P & amp; G officials also refused to disavow any relationship or contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which animal-rights activists say is an industry group secretly committed to battling the activists and persuading the public that animal testing is necessary. P & amp; G spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrey </PERSON> said the company proposed the coalition only as an industry vehicle to educate the public that sufficient alternatives have n't been develped to permit the elimination of animals in product tests. Ms. <PERSON> Ulrey </PERSON> said P & amp; G has spent $ 10 million in the last three years on research into alternatives. She said that compares with $ 150,000 that <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G plans to spend this year on the industry coalition. She said alternatives to animal testing include scientific data-based predictions of effects of product exposure, and computer-simulated results of exposure. This year several companies, including cosmetics maker <ORGANIZATION> Avons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, have announced that they were discontinuing animal tests and replacing them with alternative methods. But Ms. <PERSON> Ulrey </PERSON> said: `` Right now, the scientific community says you can not completely walk away from animal testing.''

<HEAD>Government Issuing Bonds for First Time Since WWII</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seeking new sources of money amid an economic crisis, the government is asking Poles for a loan, issuing treasury bills for the first time since World War II. But soaring inflation led the pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> to advise readers that the bonds can be considered a way to support the new non-communist-led government _ but not an investment for savings. The government hopes to raise 420 billion zlotys, or $ 289 million. Bonds redeemable within six months will have a total face value of 600 billion zlotys. The annual interest rate will be about 86 percent, about twice as much as banks are paying in interest. But inflation during the month of August alone was put at 50 percent after government controls on food prices were lifted and the value of the zloty continued to plummet as the government printed more money to cover the budget deficit. The government budget deficit totals more than 4 trillion zlotys, or $ 2.75 billion. Finance Vice Minister <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Podsiadlo </PERSON>, announcing the start of the bond sale next Monday, said he is optimistic the government would be able to repay its obligations from the receipts from the next bond issue planned. Planning for the bond issue began under the previous finance minister, who was replaced by a Solidarity supporter after <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> took office as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist prime minister Aug. 24 and formed a cabinet Sept. 12. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has been struggling to put together an economic recovery plan that will satisfy Poles pressed by rising prices and shortages of consumer goods and Western bankers considering aid plans and rescheduling of payments on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39 billion foreign debt. The bonds will be sold at banks and post offices until Dec. 30 and will be available to individuals, enterprises and foreigners who obtain permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Surge After Crop-Threatening Chill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cotton futures prices made strong gains Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after a chilly night in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> threatened further damage to a crop already badly battered by inclement weather. On other markets, copper futures fell; gold and platinum rose; energy futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Cotton futures settled .15 cent to 1.27 cents higher with the contract for delivery in October at 73.15 cents a pound. Prices had surged the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit earlier in the session on reports of record-low temperatures overnight in the high plains of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Delta Region. Cold temperatures temporarily halt the development of the cotton crop, which is rapidly maturing and in the early stages of the harvest. `` It stops the growth completely until it gets warm again,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, cotton specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Profit-taking brought prices down near the end of the session but forecasts for more cold weather later this week kept traders on edge. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton crop has had a poor season, with too much rain in some areas and not enough in others. In a Sept. 12 crop report, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> projected this year's harvest at 12.28 million bales, 20 percent below last year's crop. Copper futures prices fell sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news of a larger-than-expected, 13,500-metric-ton increase in copper stocks registered with the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The market had expected the exchange's weekly report to show a buildup of about 10,000 metric tons. Copper settled 2.6 cents to 2.85 cents lower with September at $ 1.335 a troy ounce. Gold futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and platinum futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar weakened on international currency markets. Gold settled $ 3.60 to $ 4.20 higher with October at $ 370.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to 0.5 cent lower with September at $ 5.283 a troy ounce. Platinum futures settled $ 7.30 to $ 8.10 higher with October at $ 488.10 a troy ounce. Most energy futures rose moderately amid jitters about an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were reported to be near an agreement to raise their collective production ceiling to 21 million barrels per day from 19.5 million barrels. Analysts said world demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil exceeds 22 million barrels per day and many doubted the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations would adhere to production quotas. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 20 cents higher with November at $ 19.46 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to .72 cent higher with October at 57.51 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .23 cent lower to .50 cent higher with October at 61.67 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures drifted to a mixed finish on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, where a lack of significant news kept the trading floor quiet and activity thin. Frost occurred over the weekend in the northern tier of Midwestern states and touched the northern extremes of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> but the chill was no worse than traders had expected and had little impact on prices. Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with December at $ 3.90 \ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.30 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 1.42 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 11 cents higher with November at $ 5.72 -LCB- a Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid profit-taking following the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Friday that 7,000 to 10,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork bellies would be donated to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Hog futures advanced slightly while cattle futures were narrowly mixed. Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .22 cent higher with October at 71.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .28 cent higher with September at 83.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to .35 cent higher with October at 43.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .73 cent to 1.08 cents lower with February at 48.20 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Wolf Defends Profits He Would Make from Employee Buyout of UAL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an apparent move to deflect criticism from employees over the profits he stands to make from a pilot-management buyout, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> says he is willing to work without a `` golden parachute'' and a year's In an interview published in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> defended the estimated $ 76.7 million he stands to reap from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock and options he holds if the proposed takeover of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, is completed. Under the $ 6.75 billion buyout proposal, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots would make pay and benefits concessions worth $ 250 million a year over seven years in exchange for a 75 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. In his first interview since the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board of directors approved the pilot-management buyout earlier this month, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> told the Journal that he plans to forgo his $ 575,000 annual salary for the first year after the takeover. He also said he was willing to work indefinitely without a contract, which would prevent him from receiving his substantial `` golden parachute'' severance pay should he leave <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said he has asked other senior managers to follow his lead and work without contracts. He also said he plans to donate $ 1 million from his profits to educational charities. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, 48, is guaranteed to benefit financially from the $ 300-a-share proposed buyout by senior managers, the pilots union and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. He said, though, that he would do everything in his power to make sure the employees make a profit on their own investment in the takeover. While <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> warned there is no way to guarantee that rank-and-file employees will benefit from the takeover, he added, `` It is my objective to return to employees 100 percent of their investment and a significant profit margin on top of that.'' Documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> disclosed Friday how much <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> is guaranteed to make once the buyout is completed, as well as the information that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, would receive $ 37.7 million from his <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock and options. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> would get $ 22.5 million for his 75,000 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares and $ 54.17 million for his options to buy another 250,000 shares. Pope stands to make $ 3 million on his 10,000 shares and $ 34.65 million on his options. The two would continue to run the company under the buyout plan. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> disclosures came while <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and other senior managers were trying to persuade all <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> employees to make wage concessions and productivity improvements to help facilitate the takeover. So far, only the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a party to the takeover, has agreed to participate. In addition to the $ 250 million a year in concessions, the pilots have pledged $ 200 million from pension funds toward the buyout. The sharpest criticism of <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and the other senior executives has come from the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which is not participating in the buyout. A Machinist spokesman said the union finds the Wolf windfall `` offensive,'' and also objects to the fact that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s outside directors recently voted themselves $ 20,000-a-year salaries for life and unlimited free travel privileges on the airline. The employees would own 75 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> under the proposal, making it the largest employee-owned company in the nation. A management group headed by <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> would hold 10 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would hold the remaining 15 percent in exchange for a $ 750 million investment.

<HEAD>Sale Agreement With Coors Could End Stroh's Long Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 425 million buyout proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could mean the end of independence for <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a 139-year-old, family-owned pillar of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s business community. Coors and <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> said Monday they reached an agreement in principle on Friday for the sale, ending a bid for national dominance that <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> began in 1982 when it acquired <PERSON> Jos </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 494.7 million. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> said in February it wanted a partner with cash to help pay off debts and enable it to come closer to matching advertising dollars with the likes of beer market leader <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. But on Aug. 31 of this year, Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, great-grandson of the company founder, announced there were no takers and that <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> was trimming support of community events and laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar workers to cut costs. Two hundred of the layoffs were in the company's <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> headquarters, the rest in its seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breweries. The company, founded in 1850 by German immigrant <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, made its last beer in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in 1985. `` That there wo n't be a <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> family in the beer business is difficult for many people who have been in the industry,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON> of the trade newsletter Beer Marketers Insights. `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has been a well-liked person and his Uncle <PERSON> John </PERSON> -LRB- board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB- was adored. So it's the end of an era in the industry.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> issued a statement saying his company had neither the size nor the money to compete with larger publicly held competitors. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> spent an estimated $ 21 million last year promoting its major brands, <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> and Stroh Light, while <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> spent an estimated $ 204 million promoting Budweiser and Bud Light, Beer Marketer's Insights said. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> had cut expenditures such as sponsorship of auto racing, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s television specials and community programs, including annual Freedom Festival fireworks over the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The company recently launched an advertising campaign stressing the family's background as brewers with roots in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> more than 200 years ago. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> said that made the decision to sell difficult, but caused the family to lean toward dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, also a family-run operation. `` I think you'll find a lot of people will be glad the suspense is over,'' said one employee entering the company Monday after the announcement of the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a relief,'' said the worker, who would n't give her name. Several other <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> employees declined comment. One man said he did n't know how to react because he did n't know yet what would become of his job. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> workers face a period of suspense waiting for word on who will be laid off and who will stay to manage the company's remaining businesses Those include Sundance sparkling fruit-juice beverages, <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> juice drinks, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler wine coolers, and interests in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> brewery and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sleeman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guelph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, senior vice president, counsel and secretary, said the sale would n't affect <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> family enterprises apart from the brewery company, including family interests in the <LOCATION> Stroh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> and Brewery Park office complexes and the newly opened $ 16 million, 109-room <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION>, all in downtown <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` Precise plans which we have for any of our remaining facilities or businesses have not been determined,'' said <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, senior vice president, counsel and secretary. He said details would be worked out in time to close the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> in January or earlier. <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> family members would n't comment beyond <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s statement.

 Crude oil futures rose Monday amid expectations that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would legitimize current production by raising its quota but would not go any higher. `` There are a lot of optimistic people out there,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreis </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` As long as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production does n't change and as long as demand remains strong out there, it's not going to make that much difference.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 18 cents to close at $ 19.46 a 42-gallon barrel. December crude rose 20 cents to $ 19.32 and January advanced 22 cents to $ 19.21 a barrel. Among refined products, heating oil for October delivery added 0.54 cent to finish at 57.51 cents a gallon, while other contract months posted slightly higher gains. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery, which had risen last week after reports of hurricane damage to a big refinery in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, declined 0.28 cent to 61.67 cents a gallon. November slipped 0.3 cent to 58.13 cents, while contracts for later delivery rose. Traders said the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> dominated the day's trading. Late in the day, some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> delegates said the cartel was close to signing an agreement that would formalize <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production at about 21 million barrels. However, a meeting scheduled late in the day was abruptly postponed until Tuesday. Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Chalabi </PERSON> said the delay was due to slight differences among some members over the exact quota. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has a stated ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day, but so-called cheating by some of the 13 members has put the oil-producing group's actual production at about 22 million barrels. Some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> sources have said they believe current world demand is enough to sustain a higher quota without weakening prices. Although crude prices are below levels of this spring, they have remained in the $ 19 - $ 20 range Analysts said legitimizing <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production at around 21 million barrels a day probably would not dampen prices as long as members stick to the agreement.

<HEAD>Financial Firm Files for Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it filed for bankruptcy court protection so it can focus on restructuring plans after negotiations with creditors dragged on for three months. `` It was just to the point where time had run out,'' <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> said. `` It was really the pressure of the time that had passed.'' <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors filing Sunday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The action freezes payments on a total of $ 2.1 billion in debt. It involves only the parent company and some land developing subsidiaries. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> is the nation's third-largest mortgage banker with more than $ 6 billion in assets and operations. Hurt by real estate problems and a slowdown in mortgage lending, <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> reported a $ 56.4 million loss in fiscal 1988 and a $ 304.5 million loss in the year that ended June 30. In June, <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> announced a major restructuring program that sought to reduce its outstanding debt by nearly two-thirds, to about $ 2 billion from $ 5.7 billion. The company already had reduced its total debt by $ 1.9 billion from the asset sales. But as <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> was implementing its restructuring plan, it also was trying to negotiate an agreement with senior debt-holders. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> missed a $ 145 million payment on senior debt Sept. 1, at which time creditors could have forced the immediate payment of all senior debt. Talks had been continuing between <LOCATION> Lomas </LOCATION> officials and the creditors. `` Despite substantial progress in restructuring our business, exhaustive negotiations with our lenders over a three-month period did not produce timely closure or a satisfactory debt restructure,'' <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chairman </PERSON> and Chief Executive <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said in a statement. `` As the complex negotiations and disputes among creditors dragged on, time simply ran out,'' he said. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> had hoped to settle with the 50 lenders by the end of July, then the end of August. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said it became apparent last week the firm was `` at least two or three weeks away'' from an agreement with holders of its senior debt. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> said all of its senior creditors except two banks _ holding 3 percent of the debt _ had agreed to the restructuring which analysts believed could have forestalled a bankruptcy court filing. Subsidiaries including <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON>' mortgage banking, life insurance and leasing companies, did not seek bankruptcy protection, the company said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar plunged on world markets Monday as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its major allies demonstrated determination to push the currency's value lower in a bid to solve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit problems. The sell-off began in hectic trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and was later matched in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> markets in what traders described as a rout for the dollar. `` The market is shell-shocked,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, a trader in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The manner in which the central banks conducted the intervention in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today was extremely effective.'' The dollar began dropping when markets opened in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with the decline continuing later in trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar lost 1.4 percent of its value, falling to 142.95 yen, compared to a Friday level of 145 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell further to 142.69 yen. The slide continued in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the dollar skidded to 142.13 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, down 2.7 percent from Friday's level of 146.05. The dollar also lost ground against the West German mark, the British pound, the French franc and other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. Traders reported heavy selling on the part of the centrals banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. The well-coordinated moves were timed to back up a blunt statement expressing displeasure with the dollar's rise in value this year. The statement was issued late Saturday by finance officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The discussions, being held in conjunction with the annual meetings of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and its sister lending organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, were hosted by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. The communique expressed fears that the dollar's rise threatened to abort the improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes American goods more expensive on overseas markets. Finance officials pronounced themselves pleased with the impact of their efforts Monday and said they stood ready to take further coordinated efforts if the markets try to push the dollar higher again. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> termed the coordinated intervention a `` confirmation and illustration'' of the new resolve on the part of the Group of Seven countries. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, president of the West German central bank, said that Monday's sell-off of dollars by central banks had been `` obviously quite successful.'' He said `` we will still continue to coordinate with our American, Japanese and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> colleagues in order to achieve the results we agreed upon in the G-7 meeting.'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> added to market nervousness with his statement, in response to a question, that hinted the West German central bank might be poised to push interest rates higher in view of rapid growth in that country. Many economists said they are looking for Monday's coordinated dollar selling to be followed later on by coordinated changes in interest rates to further depress the dollar's value. A rise in interest rates in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would tend to weaken the dollar because it would boost the rate-of-return on investments in those countries in relation to dollar-denominated investments. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been putting pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates in this country, a move that could also relieve the upward pressure on the dollar, but economists said this was less likely to occur given lingering inflation worries at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Before Saturday's meeting, the dollar had risen by about 20 percent against the Japanese yen and 25 perent against the West German mark this year. Those rises occurred despite a record level of dollar selling on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> over the summer. Some economists expressed the belief that the latest round of intervention could carry more weight, especially if backed up later by coordinated interest rate moves. `` I think it is in the interest of all countries to push the dollar down,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is worried that weaker exports could lead to a possible recession in 1990, an election year, while <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> are both worried about the need to push interest rates higher to combat inflation. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a speech Monday before the World Bank-IMF meetings, called for continued efforts to provide debt relief to more nations under the so-called <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan. He called this approach `` the only hope for achieving our common goal of extending prosperity throughout the world.'' Finance officials from other countries said they still hoped to achieve agreement for boosting the resources of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> before the end of the year although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made it known that it was not yet convinced of the need to boost the lending institution's reserves, known as quotas. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meetings continue through Thursday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled to address the gathering on Wednesday.

 Celestial Seasonings announced Monday it will buy <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s only independent herb-tea manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Cominso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a move to establish a strong presence in the Canadian herbal-tea market. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. `` Cominso will accelerate Celestial's commitment to expanding the herb tea and specialty tea markets in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said Celestial's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Barnet </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinblum </PERSON>, in a prepared statement. <PERSON> Feinblum </PERSON> said the agreement `` demonstrates Celestial's desire to establish operational bases in countries of growing importance to our business.'' Established in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1928, <PERSON> Cominso </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> in 1948 and entered the Canadian market as an importer and marketer of herbs. In 1981, it began manufacturing herb teas under contract for other companies, and later became an independent herb tea maker. Cominso president <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrab </PERSON> said the company's sales account for about 50 percent of the Canadian herbal tea market, with the main competition being <LOCATION> Lipton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which manufactures its tea in a factory in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He said Celestial, the largest specialty tea company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with more than half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> herb tea market, had not yet established itself in the Canadian market but would do so now. `` Celestial Seasonings' innovation created the herb tea industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and together we expect to dramatically increase the herb tea industry in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hrab </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hrab </PERSON> said he will continue to oversee operations at Cominso's plant, which employs about 30 people in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> `` We figure we will double our employees because we expect Celestial to have a very big push in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Holding Up $3 Billion for Poorest Countries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to promise $ 3 billion it is expected to contribute to loans for the world's poorest countries, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said Monday The money would be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of a $ 14.5 billion fund to be lent out over three years to about 55 countries where the income of the average citizen is little more than $ 1 a day. It would be distributed by bank affilaite the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 40-year loans at less than 1 percent interest a year. `` Unfortunately, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not in a position this past week to advise its <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> partners of its ability to take an appropriate share of a ... replenishment of this magnitude,'' <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said. He spoke at a closed door meeting of the development committee, which includes representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, now holding their annual meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A copy of his statement was distributed to reporters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is holding out against a proposal to make a big increase in the $ 120 billion now availale for the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> said Monday he thought a compromise eventually would be reached on about $ 80 billion in new money. About $ 16 billion of that would come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but unlike the <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> contribution, it would not be a charge on the federal budget. IDA's money is replenished every three years. The contributions now being sought would be lent beginning next July 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is now working on an appropriation of $ 975 million, the final <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to IDA for the current three-year period. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest giver among the 34 current donor countries, providing more than one-fifth of the money. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> held out hope the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would change its mind about the <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> contribution at a meeting to be held in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in November. On a proposed new three-year pool of $ 14.5 billion, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said: `` To most members, agreement on this approximate amount seems feasible and they have indicated their willingness to take a reasonable share under the right circumstances.'' A <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the only holdout. But some other countries will make contributions dependent on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share, so if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offers a smaller sum than expected other nations might reduce their contribution.

 The recession many experts once predicted for next year will not occur until at least late 1991, according to business economists, who on Monday forecast slower but continued economic growth through 1990. Confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s `` soft-landing'' policy of controlled expansion to limit inflation and unemployment was a primary reason for the largely favorable report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to prevent growth from going too fast or too slow. It seems to be working, and the vast majority of this group likes this very much,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of the organization, which is holding its annual meeting here. A majority of <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> forecasting experts, 52 percent, expected the current record peacetime expansion to continue until late 1991 or beyond. That would surpass the 106-month record set during a period in the 1960s that included the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Only 9.9 percent expected a recession this year, and only 21 percent predicted an economic slowdown in 1990. Association experts also forecast that the growth in the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, would continue at the current 2.1 percent annual rate through 1990, then rise to an average 2.7 a year for the 1989-93 five-year period. `` No boom, no bust, more good news than bad,'' was how <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> characterized the report, which also predicted continued low levels of inflation and unemployment. The <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION>'s predictions were echoed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke to 400 of the association's members Monday. `` We anticipate continued growth for the economy albeit at a slower rate,'' said <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, who predicted a 2.5 percent growth rate in 1989 that would pick up somewhat in mid-1990. `` Our best guess ... is for sustained moderate growth, gradual reductions in inflation and continued low employment,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> economists predicted 5 percent annual inflation for this year's October through December quarter and 4.3 percent for all of 1993. Unemployment, the lowest in 15 years, should average 5.3 percent this year and rise only to 5.7 percent in 1990, the panel said. While economists welcomed slower growth as a way of curbing inflation, they acknowledged it would be so sluggish for the next two years that it would feel like a downturn for many industries. `` Some parts of the country and some industries ... are going to feel they're in a recession,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Businesses most affected would be producers of consumer goods because consumers are holding onto their wallets, the <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> said. Consumer spending, which grew 3.4 percent last year, will grow 2.2 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 1990, economists said. `` For a country in which ` shop'til you drop' is almost the national battle cry, this could easily be viewed as the most un-American forecast ever issued by the <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> forecast panel,'' the association report said. Meanwhile, consumers are saving more, said the panel, which expects the savings rate to soar because of continued low unemployment. The <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> also expected the nation's twin trade and budget deficit to continue their slow decline. The economists' median forecast for the trade deficit was $ 110 billion this year and $ 100 billion in 1990, compared with $ 122.8 billion in 1988. The survey panel expects a $ 150 billion budget deficit this year and $ 135 billion in 1990, compared with $ 155.1 billion last year. The forecast is far from the $ 100 billion deficit reduction ceiling mandated for fiscal 1990 by the Gramm-Rudman law. Other forecasts in the survey included: _ Industrial production should grow 3.1 percent this year, slowing to 1.7 percent in 1990 _ Construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average 1.42 million units this year and 1.45 million units in 1990 _ Car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this year before falling to 14.7 million in 1990

 <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it reached an agreement in principle on a $ 425 million buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a move analysts said effectively creates a `` Big Three'' group of dominant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breweries. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, the brewery's president and chief executive, said the proposed acquisition of most of <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s brewing and container facilities and brands would strengthen his company's distributor organization, product quality and brand names. `` If we are going to be in the beer business long-term, we've got to be a major and significant competitor,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> The purchase price includes cash plus assumption of long-term debt and certain other liabilities. The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by the boards of directors of both companies and government regulators. A combined Coors-Stroh would control about 18.7 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer market _ <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> now holds 11 percent _ trailing only <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s 41 percent share and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with 21 percent The next biggest afer Coors-Stroh, <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has about a 7 percent market share, according to industry estimates. A buyout also would end the independence of 139-year-old <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, a Detroit-based brewery that makes such brands as <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON>. Coors brands include <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>; Extra Gold Draft; <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Original Draft; JH Light; <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>'s Red, and Winterfest. Coors also introduced the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> Light bargain brands a month ago and is marketing them on a limited basis. <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The Coors family controls 100 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' Class A voting stock and about a third of its nonvoting, publicly traded Class B stock. The Class B shares rose $ 1.50 to $ 23.75 a share in over-the-counter trading Monday. Coors began expanding from a regional to a national brewer in the early 1980s and now sells its products in 49 states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> operations would be consolidated under <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit of $ 12.1 million, or 33 cents a share, in the first six months of this year, down more than 47 percent from a year earlier. In announcing its earnings in July, chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> said the beer industry faced stiff price competition, rising operating costs and flat volume growth. For its part, <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has had financial problems in the wake of its move to go national by acquiring <PERSON> Jos </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. Analysts say <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, which is privately held and does not report its earnings, was unable to make inroads on the growth of industry leader <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has been looking for potential partners since February and announced Aug. 31 it had been unsuccessful and was laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar employees nationwide. Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, great-grandson of the company founder, issued a statement that his company had neither the size nor the money to compete with larger publicly held competitors. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harriman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said combining the two companies means <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> could compete better and benefit from economies of scale, distribution and purchasing. `` You may have more clout all along the line, more bang for the buck in advertising, and more bang for the buck in general,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Sends `Twiggy' Back for Trial, Lets `Lisa' Go</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court ruled Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its top officers must go to trial on the question of whether its optimistic statements about a novel new office computer disc-drive dubbed `` Twiggy'' misled investors. The Cupertino-based company was sued by a group of investors claiming fraud in connection with the promotion of a computer called `` Lisa'' and a compatible disc-drive, `` Twiggy,'' in 1982 and 1983. Both proved commercially unsuccessful and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> replaced Twiggy with another system before beginning actual sales of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, which later was discontinued. The investors contend they bought <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> stock at an artificially high price based on <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s misrepresentations. They said they suffered severely when the products failed and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> stock plunged 75 percent. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled 3-0 that unlike information about the market risks of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, problems linked to Twiggy `` were not made known to the market by the press or by anyone else,'' although internal tests indicated the mechanism's information processing ability was slow and unreliable Appeals Judge <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said the appeals court could n't determine if <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s `` failure to disclose <PERSON> Twiggy </PERSON>'s technical problems had no misleading effect on market price. So the court said the matter should be decided by a lower court jury. The court said that `` any overall impression created by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s optimism was adequately counterbalanced by the press' documentation of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s risks. It upheld a grant of summary judgment to <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> involving the <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carleen </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVassur </PERSON> said company officials were pleased by the ruling, which she called a `` very significant decision'' that shows <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> acted properly in promoting the products and did not violate any securities laws. As far as Twiggy, <PERSON> LeVassur </PERSON> said authorities are confident the matter will be resolved in <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s favor. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, designed for medium - to large-sized corporations, had several technological innovations that proved commercially viable when incorporated into <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s Macintosh computer <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> pioneered use of the `` mouse,'' a hand-held device that allows communication with the computer without using the keyboard, and `` icons,'' graphic displays of the computer's functions.
