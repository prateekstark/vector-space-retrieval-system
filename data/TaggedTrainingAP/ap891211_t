 When she was born, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s doctors said she would never be able to walk, but the 14-year-old high school freshman has overcome congenital bone defects and is now a cheerleader. After enduring years of operations, including amputation of both feet, she attends <ORGANIZATION> Wynford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royals </ORGANIZATION> basketball games, wearing artificial limbs that fit over the calf up to the knee. `` My parents and God have helped me,'' she said before dashing onto the court at a recent basketball game. `` She has the guts and potential that are God-given,'' said her father, <PERSON> William </PERSON>. `` We take very little credit. She's done it on her own.'' At birth, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>'s hips were dislocated and the bones in her legs were n't formed. Doctors said she would never walk. At three months, doctors wrapped her body in a full cast, hoping to straighten her hips. She wore the cast until she was 11 months old. After hundreds of treatments by specialists at <ORGANIZATION> Shriners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for Crippled Children in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, she finally decided at age 10 to undergo amputation instead of bone fusion. After the first amputation, she walked into her fourth-grade classroom on the first day of school with a prosthesis on her right leg and a pair of crutches. She underwent the second amputation in June 1988, but only after playing for the seventh-grade girls volleyball team and trying out for cheerleading.

 More than a half-century after fleeing the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, 81-year-old <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> on Monday received her doctorate in sociology at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> university. `` It's the last thing I expected in my life,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I'm elated, I'm proud, I'm surprised.'' The dean of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s sociology department, <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> was awarded the degree magna cum laude It was a big surprise for the retired <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> interpreter, who was 25 when she fled the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1933, leaving behind her completed 247-page thesis for her doctorate. She first fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and then to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops marched on <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I'm not particularly proud of myself in general, but I thought the dissertation was rather good,'' Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said. It was delivered in German. `` But frankly I did not expect a magna cum laude. That was a very enormous surprise,'' she said, chuckling. Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last week to take part in a colloquium Friday, part of 75th anniversary celebrations at the universtiy's social sciences department. `` I'm absolutely shattered. I think I never have been so exhausted, not only physically, but psychologically too, after that day on Friday,'' the soft-spoken Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said. As part of the colloquium, Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> read several poems, taking an active part in the ceremonies, said Professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kettler </PERSON>, who was instrumental in arranging for her to get the degree. <PERSON> Kettler </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Trent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, said it took him a year, along with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>'s half-sister, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Papanek </PERSON>, to make arrangements for awarding the doctorate. `` It was like one of those ideas you suddenly have in the shower,'' <PERSON> Kettler </PERSON> said. `` This is the university facing up to its responsibility to its students and faculty. She did the work and deserves to be recognized for it.'' Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1908 to parents of Jewish descent, who fled their native <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> as political exiles after the failed Russian revolution of 1905. She lived in neutral <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> from 1914 through 1917, where she had fled with her mother to avoid World War I. Later she returned to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to study, and in 1928 began working toward her degree under the noted sociology professor, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannheim </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> recalled how she enjoyed being in Mannheim's presence, and how the students used to meet him at Cafe <PERSON> Laumer </PERSON> in the university area of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bockenheim </LOCATION> district `` We very often met there with <PERSON> Mannheim </PERSON>. Of course, all the young ladies there adored him, he was extremely attractive, I've never forgotten that,'' she said Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> then pointed out photographs showing herself, and other students reading and chatting at the cafe with Mannheim, taken between 1930 and 1933. `` He went to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> right away'' after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> came, Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said. `` I never saw him again. I lost contact with him.'' <PERSON> Mannheim </PERSON>, who last worked at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, had published dozens of manuscripts on sociology, including `` Man and <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in an Age of Reconstruction,'' in 1935. He died in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1947. Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said she was ready to defend her thesis, titled `` The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emigration </LOCATION> after 1789 _ A Contribution to the Sociology of Political Emigration,'' when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> took over <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> university in 1933. She said a Nazi student retrieved her thesis, which she left behind on a desk in the university, before she fled to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> she worked as a translator and secretary for a literary agency, but fled again in 1940 when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, leaving everything behind, including her thesis. A French neighbor kept Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>'s belongings, and after the war traced her to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and sent the thesis to her, she said. Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>, who worked as a simultaneous translator, `` mostly in Russian,'' for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, shelved the thesis for years until her half-sister, Ms. <PERSON> Papanek </PERSON>, a research professor of anthropology at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, began trying to get it published. Later, efforts by Ms. <PERSON> Papanek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kettler </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> university's <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> and Professor <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Honegger </PERSON>, arranged for Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> to finally receive her degree. Miss <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said she will return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Thursday. `` I'm incredibly tired and I have the feeling when I come back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> I'm going to go to bed and stay there for a couple of days,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A mob informant and his <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> police guards developed such a loose relationship over 3 -LCB- years that they frolicked in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> together and sold vehicles to each other, even though the protected witness was serving a prison term. And security was so lax that anybody looking for informant <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> _ a prized witness who traveled to court surrounded by police sharpshooters _ had only to look in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> auto title applications to find the address of his supposedly secret hideaway. His widow, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON>, and her lawyer also alleged in recent interviews at her <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> home that police told Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> to turn in phony receipts for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s expenses. A <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> attorney general's report also said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, serving a 10-year prison term for murder at the time he was a protected witness, illegally had guns and improperly collected welfare and often was allowed to roam freely. He frequently was ferried to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with his guards, some of whom allegedly brought their girlfriends. `` It was just as if they were a bunch of fraternity guys, skydiving, drinking, women,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s attorney Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s revelations are the latest about her husband's custody that have surfaced since he died June 11, 1988 They flabbergast the man who founded the federal witness protection program. `` Our prime goal is to keep him alive, to keep him in the right frame of mind to testify,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Partington </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal recently named <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, public safety commissioner. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 43, died of a heart attack while on an unsupervised skydiving trip to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. The attorney general's report later acknowledged police knew he had a history of heart problems. Police found cocaine in his car. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> state police are investigating, but previous reports by the attorney general and The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> showed the state spent as much as $ 169,000 on <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and his wife during his 3 -LCB- years in police custody _ purchases included bullets, liquor, jewelry, concert tickets and 52 skydiving trips. Two of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s guards have committed suicide since his death and two were reassigned from the police intelligence unit to the uniform division. Former <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, who became the attorney general's chief drug enforcement officer while continuing to be paid by <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> after stepping down as chief, recently resigned from the attorney general's office and the force, citing continued publicity about the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was supposed to be a key witness against six reputed mobsters but testified against only one before his death. Because he died, charges against most of the others were dropped. Under an agreement with the attorney general's office, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> lived at the <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> police station from his arrest in February 1985 until his transfer to a <LOCATION> Glocester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, safe house in January 1988. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> alternated between living in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and with her husband in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Police and the attorney general's office refused to release the safe house address, but it was listed on a March 1988 title application <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> filed at the Motor Vehicle Registry in connection with a car loan. `` That is unbelievable,'' <PERSON> Partington </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to be a police chief or security expert to say it's unthinkable'' for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s address to be in public records. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> paid Detective <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> $ 3,000 for a 13-year-old <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> motorcycle in April 1988, according to sales tax documents provided by a source close to the investigation who demanded anonymity. `` I know about a motorcycle,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who declined to answer other questions. <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and state police and the attorney general's office wo n't comment on the case. <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, who stepped down in 1988, denied knowledge of any transactions between <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and his guards, but would say no more. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> won ` t talk about many things because of the pending state police investigation. But <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said that among her other allegations are that: _ <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> sold a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cordoba </ORGANIZATION> to police matron <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> in early 1986. No title could be found under either name and <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> referred questions to Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said she took over loan payments on <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s 1984 Buick after his death. _ <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> told his wife her sixth-anniversary ring in 1987 was bought from <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who denies it. _ Police officers told her to get phony receipts to include with the ones submitted to the attorney general for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s expenses _ receipts the attorney general's report says often were not reviewed. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> says she never heeded the officers' advice and wo n't name them. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said her husband made at least a dozen state-paid trips to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for family visits and to clear up outstanding charges, including a prison break. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said the guards often brought girlfriends. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said the guards and women would stay in hotel rooms while <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would stay with his wife at her home, more than a mile away. It could not be determined who paid for the rooms or if the guards watched Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s house. <ORGANIZATION> WPRI </ORGANIZATION> televison in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> recently broadcast home videos of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and his guards frolicking in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and at a vacation home in <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>. One tape showed an officer, with his arm around <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, saying: `` The criminal justice system has been very, very good to us, huh <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>?

<TEXT>
 Parallel to the revolution around it, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s 700-year-old shrinking Jewish community has staged its own tumultuous uprising and deposed old leaders who had accommodated the Communists. Freedom might fire the dwindling band with fresh life, the new leader said, but even that may not be enough. Furor erupted when the Council of Jewish Communities did not protest the police beating of student demonstrators Nov. 17. It was the only Czechoslovak religious group to remain silent. Rabbi <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> sent his own letter, decrying `` brutality and arrogance,'' then threatened to quit if <PERSON> Bohumil </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> did not relinquish command of the council. Young Jews already had criticized the two, in another letter, for what they described as sacrificing principles to appease authorities. In a noisy open meeting Sunday, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Jews reinstated <PERSON> Desider </PERSON> <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON>, a 68-year-old historian who was council president until Czechoslovak authorities forced him out in 1985. `` Everyone is watching me now,'' <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON> said, `` but I can not create a heaven in 24 hours. These will be difficult times.'' His main concern is that simple attrition will accomplish what <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> could not: turn <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s 13th century Old-New Synagogue into a museum. The Nazis found 47,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and killed most of them, but spared the medieval Jewish Quarter, with its relics and documents, as a museum of deviant culture. Jews returned after the war, but more than 1,000 are on community rolls, fewer than 2,000 others live in the city and three-quarters are over 65. About 10,000 Jews live elsewhere in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` For every 20 who die, two or three others join,'' said <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>. `` We are very worried about the numbers.'' Asked whether new freedoms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> would help the Jews, he replied without a pause: `` No.'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said the government Council on Religious Affairs probably would end its subsidies, and the community would find it hard to survive. Jewish leaders accept the money on grounds the state seized priceless objects in the 1950s and never paid compensation. Pressed on the subject, <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> chuckled and added: `` On balance, I suppose I'd rather have freedom.'' <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON> said he was negotiating to keep the annual stipend, equivalent to about $ 30,000, but only if other religious groups retained theirs. `` We hope that Jews around the world will help us,'' he said. Money aside, many <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Jews think a more open <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will bring out Jews who once feared praying in public. `` I think things will be better,'' said <PERSON> Vida </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuwirthova </PERSON>, a 27-year-old puppeteer who runs a Jewish children's troupe and works with the Jewish choir. `` We badly need young people.'' Her choir has emerged from years in which authorities would not let it perform in public because choir members refused to exclude the wife of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON>, a dissident writer whose works were banned until recently. Ms. <PERSON> Neuwirthova </PERSON> knows it will be an uphill fight. She has yet to persuade her husband, who is not a Jew, to allow a bar mitzvah when their 2-year-old is 13. `` He does not want his son to be different,'' she said. Bar mitzvahs average one every two years, but <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON> plans to encourage foreign Jews to come to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for bar mitzvahs and weddings in what he calls the oldest continuous Jewish congregation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Saturday morning services are in a narrow, vaulted room off the locked main temple. A dozen old men in shawls murmur Hebrew, sitting at a kitchen table whose plastic cover is patterned with gaily colored animals. Much livelier is the community's kosher restaurant in the building next door, not to be confused with the nearby Old Synagogue Restaurant, which serves roast pork and dumplings. Tourists normally outnumber Jews in the cobbled streets that wind among houses built centuries ago by merchants and intellectuals. Two old synagogues are museums, containing 300,000 of the silver ornaments, prayer shawls and documents <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> planned to display. At the old Jewish cemetery, visitors thread their way among broken stone tombs where people were buried up to nine deep to save precious space. Only for holidays, and in times of crisis, do <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Jews come out in force, and the question is how long there will be enough. `` Who knows?'' reflected <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON>. `` In 10 years, we might still be all right. But in 20?'' At the open meeting, <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Radvansky </PERSON>, a 33-year-old pediatrician who reads no Hebrew and wears no yarmulke, drew loud applause for a tongue-lashing. He said he joined the community as a child to be among other Jews and was distressed to see people leave it over the years because of internal squabbles. Clearly, he was unhappy about compromises made with communism. <PERSON> Radvansky </PERSON> excoriated Jews who fight among themselves as their numbers dwindle, and proposed a group for people interested in Jewish culture, whatever their own religion. `` We must stop this stupid bickering and protect our heritage,'' he said. `` Otherwise, we will disappear.''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Artists and intellectuals in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> are excavating the dark past of the Nationalist government, sparking a cultural boom in this economic powerhouse. Movies, court cases, a radio drama and the recent election campaign have created a flood of pressure on this island of 20 million to confront its past. The boom has also given voice to native Taiwanese, who make up 85 percent of the population but have had scant political influence since 1949 when the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seized power after losing a civil war to the Communists on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We are awakening after a long sleep,'' says <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, editor of the prestigious Journalist magazine. `` We are finally learning who we are, where we came from.'' Taiwanese have always regarded their rocky island as `` the orphan of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' as a popular song goes. Since the 17th century, they have been ruled by Spaniards, Dutch, Japanese and Chinese from the mainland. When the Nationalists took power, they imposed the culture of the mainland on the little island. Mandarin Chinese replaced Taiwanese dialect in the classroom and students were fined if they spoke the local patois. Taiwanese history was dominated by Chinese history. Only fools or gangsters spoke Taiwanese on TV. `` I do n't know how many times my teacher made me stand with a board around my neck, saying ` I ` ll never speak Taiwanese again,''' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shui-pien </PERSON>, a leading opposition politician. `` The mainlanders made us feel like Taiwanese natives were second-class citizens.'' A change came in 1987 when then-President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> ended 38 years of martial law. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s astounding economic growth had created an increasingly sophisticated population which no longer tolerated harsh political repression. The government relaxed its tight controls on the press, legalized opposition political parties and began tolerating some dissent. A further boon to the cultural boom came in June, when Communist Chinese troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crushed a pro-democracy movement. The tragedy in Tiananmen Square sparked Taiwanese to probe Nationalist abuses. In October, `` City of Sorrow,'' an award-winning film, opened in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to packed houses. The movie was the first to explore the Feb. 28, 1947 massacre, when Nationalist troops slaughtered tens of thousands of Taiwanese after clashes between island natives and mainland immigrants. A deaf-mute plays the central role and witnesses the horrors _ a powerful metaphor for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s silenced intellectuals. In its portrayal of a gangster clan, the movie probes the politically sensitive question of organized crime's influence over politics. Ironically, the film is reported to be backed by gangland money. A wildy-popular radio drama also has its roots in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s past _ the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> occupation from 1895-1945. <PERSON> Liao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tien-ting </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, who robs Japanese imperialists and gives to the poor. The show draws thinly veiled parallels between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s occupation and Nationalist government domination in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Its announcer has entered politics and is a strong supporter of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s recent election campaign, the first multiparty race in its history, also made use of the past and Taiwanese culture. One successful candidate for the Legislature, <PERSON> Yeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-lan </PERSON>, advocated independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a seditious act under the Constitution. Her victory gave voice to an undercurrent of support, especially among native Taiwanese, for cutting all ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Taiwanese folk songs filled the air at her rallies. A guerrilla theater troupe acted out scenes of alleged <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> brutality _ the 1947 killings and the death of <PERSON> Yeh </PERSON>'s husband, a dissident who immolated himself in April to escape police interrogation. The troupe also portrayed scenes from a 1979 riot in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>. On Dec. 10, 1979, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> for human rights and hundreds were injured in a brawl. The government rounded up more than 150 dissidents and dozens were sentenced to long jail terms. A celebrated court case has also returned attention to the bloody clash. In September, fugitive dissident <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>, wanted for allegedly fomenting the riot, was arrested as he tried to slip into <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> on a fishing boat. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>'s case sparked exposes in the increasingly free press. In October, the Journalist claimed police used torture and intimidation to extract confessions of participants in the riot. Other reports have called for an investigation of the killings of the wife and daughter of one of the <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> dissidents, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi-hsiung </PERSON>, jailed after the clash. `` The government should have forgetten the case and welcomed <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> back,'' said opposition figure <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, also <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>'s attorney. `` Instead, they were too worried about losing face, so they're prosecuting him That has opened up this old wound and the opposition is profiting from the controversy.'' Some intellectuals oppose this use of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s history and culture as a political weapon. <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao-hsien </PERSON>, who directed `` City of Sorrow,'' says he made the movie to return history to the people. `` The Nationalists and the opposition are using the February 28 incident like a trump card,'' he said in a recent interview. `` The movie was my way of butting into their card game and turning the trump card over. February 28 is our history, it does n't belong to political parties.'' President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, the country's first native Taiwanese leader, has asked his people to forget about the ugly past and look to the future. But, <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> counters: `` If we do n't talk about it now, we are doomed to repeat it.''

<TEXT>
 Federal bureaucrats and private insurers are scrambling to rework health insurance benefits, adjust premiums and spread the word that the end is near for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old catastrophic health care program. In addition, millions of senior citizens are refiguring their expected 1989 tax bills, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is scrapping Form 8808 before it hits the printing press, and states are trying to figure out how they will cover an extra $ 300 million to $ 400 million in health care expenses for the poor. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act _ expected to cost $ 48 billion in its first five years _ was enacted with fanfare in 1988 to protect 33 million elderly and disabled people against financial ruin from the staggering costs of prolonged illness. But even before most of the benefits took effect, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted last month to dismantle the program because of a firestorm of protest from senior citizens who complained it cost them too much. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to sign the repeal measure. Under repeal, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> must take back the extended hospitalization and nursing home coverage it has offered <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries for the past year and scrap plans to provide expanded coverage of drug and doctor bills and other medical expenses. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, the acting <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said a top priority for the agency is to get notices out to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries explaining the new limits on their hospital and nursing home benefits. `` We want to make sure that there is n't confusion,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. The agency also can forget about providing additional medical benefits that `` we had invested enormous energy and time in preparing to implement,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, have the tasks of rolling back the income tax surcharge on the elderly and the extra Medicare premium that financed the catastrophic program. The surtax was canceled completely; the extra premium will be scrapped at the end of the year. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said taxpayers will be instructed to ignore two lines on this year's 1040 tax forms _ lines 54 and 55 _ which refer senior citizens to the elusive Form 8808 that never got beyond the prototype stage. Higher-income senior citizens would have used 8808 to calculate their added income tax liability for the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits. Senior citizens who paid extra amounts in quarterly income tax payments or through wage withholding to cover the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> surtax will get any overpayments back as part of their income tax refund, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. About 40 percent of the elderly would have paid some surtax _ $ 22.50 for every $ 150 of federal income tax liability _ with about 6 percent paying the maximum amount of $ 800 per person this year. Scrapping the tax is the type of last-minute change it is easy to spring on taxpayers, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` Everybody enjoys hearing news that they do n't have to pay a tax that was on the books,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is complaining that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not give the agency enough lead time to stop withholding extra Medicare premiums that helped finance the catastrophic benefits. It may be April or May before extra payments of about $ 5.30 a month no longer are deducted from Social Security checks, with the overpayments to be refunded later. The premiums of $ 4 a month during 1989 will not be refunded. `` The bottom line is that Social Security will unscramble this egg, but we did not lay it,'' said Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. The repeal also is causing last-minute maneuvering among private insurers who will pick up some of the benefits being canned by the government. About 70 percent of elderly Americans purchase private `` medigap'' insurance to fill the gaps in their Medicare coverage. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> has until Dec. 15 to draft transition regulations for medigap policies, and private insurers have until Jan. 30 to revise their policies and premiums and notify policyholders of the changes. Any changes, however, will be retroactive to Jan. 1, when the government benefits expire. `` Insurance companies are doing their best, they're just grumbling about how long it took <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make up their mind,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's kind of a ` We'll muddle through' situation. We just hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't change their mind again next year.'' The association has estimated medigap premiums will rise 20 percent to 25 percent next year due to the combined effects of rising medical costs and the repeal of the catastrophic package. Fallout from the repeal also is reaching state governments. The repeal legislation left in place expanded Medicaid costs for the states, while scrapping provisions that would have offset some of the new expenses, said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelrine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` Grumbling is probably a tame word to describe what is going on out there,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pelrine </PERSON> said. `` States are already so maxed out on their ability to accommodate various -LRB- federal -RRB- mandates ... that a lot are saying, ` We do n't know how we're going to pay for this.''' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, said the original catastrophic legislation would have cost states $ 900 million, but the repeal bill boosts those costs by an additional $ 300 million to $ 400 million.

 From discos to dormitories and hotels, authorities are stepping up moves to limit foreigners' contacts with Chinese. Black sedans without license plates and full of security men have been parked outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy recently. Plainclothes police and surveillance cameras are being increased elsewhere to keep track of who's meeting whom. `` Police are cracking down on <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> girls who meet with foreigners,'' said a clothing saleswoman who is obliged to attend meetings where workers denounce `` American imperialism.'' `` It does n't matter if you're just friends or colleagues, they'll just assume the girl's a prostitute,'' she said. The stepped-up monitoring comes amid a crackdown on prostitution, increased warnings about AIDS and general wariness of associating with foreigners since the military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June. The Chinese government claims the June turmoil was instigated with foreign help. In November, the Culture Ministry canceled a planned exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> painter, and this month police halted plans by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to show works by six Chinese artists. Western diplomats and journalists have been turned down for routine interviews and meetings by numerous government ministries and think tanks. A well-known `` English corner'' in a public park where people gathered on Sundays to practice English also has been banned. Diplomats and foreign journalists have long lived in special compounds with armed guards and surveillance cameras. Entering taxis are checked for Chinese, who are supposed to be screened by the guards. A year ago large cameras were installed at the compounds' main entrances and inside elevators. Reporters who inquired about the measures were told they were taken because African children had beaten Chinese staff workers. Workmen last month installed more video cameras at the compounds, and two weeks ago security agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which provides staff for embassies and foreign press bureaus, began staking out apartment entrances. `` They're here to stop some of the foreigners who are bringing girls back to their apartments,'' a utility worker for the diplomatic bureau said. `` It's part of the ` Sweep Out the Six Evils' campaign.'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> began the Six Evils campaign some months ago to wipe out prostitution, gambling, drug use, selling women and children, pornography and belief in superstition. Police have stepped up monitoring of discotheques at posh hotels such as the Palace in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` There have been more than 10 plainclothes police here every day since late November,'' a hotel employee said. `` Whenever they see a Chinese girl with a foreigner, they separate them and quiz them about what the other person's name is, what their job is,'' the employee said. `` If their answers do n't match that means they just met That's how they catch them.'' The disco is frequented by `` professionals,'' some of whom appear almost every night with different partners, said the employee, who saw one Chinese woman being taken away in handcuffs last month. Punishment for prostitution is strictly enforced, and a few foreigners have been expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for buying sex. Monitoring of AIDS has been strengthened in recent months, and an unidentified foreigner with AIDS was expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in September. A receptionist at a major Chinese-run hotel was fired recently for being friendly with an Arab guest. `` My boss brought out videos taken by the security cameras of me talking to the guest and accused me of making friends with a foreigner,'' the woman said. `` He would just come over and talk to me. I thought it was fun to practice English.'' University students, who led the pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the army, are uneasy about foreign contacts. One student of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> declined to see an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friend because she believed being seen with a foreigner might jeopardize her application for a passport to study overseas. Chinese students live in dormitories segregated from foreign students and researchers. `` It's a big trouble to go visit foreign students,'' said a student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have to register, leave your I.D. card downstairs, then leave by 10 p.m.''

 In a vast sea of arms outstretched in victory, <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Machon </PERSON> joined in singing the national anthem, but, choking on emotion, he could barely get out the words. `` I can look people directly in the eye now, people from other countries,'' he said. `` We are a free people again. We are part of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> again.'' <PERSON> Machon </PERSON> was among 100,000 Czechoslovaks who on Sunday returned to <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> where only three weeks ago they first gathered to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that, after 41 years, enough was enough. On Sunday, they celebrated the naming of the first non-Communist dominated government since 1948. He is a big man with a thick mustache, but he showed no embarrassment at the tears trickling down his face. It was the students who first rose up, and <PERSON> Machon </PERSON> has three in his family. `` I am so thankful to my children for setting us free,'' he said. `` And I am so happy that they can now live their lives in freedom.'' From the towering statue of King Wenceslas on horseback to the gates of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s medieval <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, the distance of eight football fields end to end, Czechoslovaks shared the same thoughts. There were speeches and chants, but their message was all in their moist, red eyes. `` You have to understand how we felt in 1968,'' said <PERSON> Machon </PERSON>, now 47. `` We had one child then, and now we have three. Life will be different now.'' In 1968, a Soviet invasion brought an abrupt halt to the Czechoslovaks' last try for freedom. The people's only weapon were the `` V'' signs they aimed at the tanks. The next morning, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON>, carried a picture of resisting crowds, with each person holding up two fingers. The caption said they were threatening to attack Socialist troops in two minutes. This time, there was no confusion over the `` V'' victory sign. At the first strains of the national anthem, <ORGANIZATION> Machon </ORGANIZATION>'s two thick fingers were joined by 200,000 others. At every chant, he leaned over to translate for a foreign reporter, eager that the world not miss any part of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s triumph. His wife beamed and nodded happily. `` How can I explain what this means?'' said <PERSON> Machon </PERSON>, who is a geophysicist. `` When I went abroad to meetings, I could not look at people. We were different, inferior, ashamed.'' When a Frenchwoman spoke from the fourth-floor balcony, delivering a message of support from European theater groups, he glowed. After she finished, the crowd chanted, `` Merci, Merci.'' The setting said as much as <PERSON> Machon </PERSON>'s explanation. Throughout four decades of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule, Czechoslovaks spoke in private of whom they were and what they would be again someday. <PERSON> Machon </PERSON> knew Sunday was that day. With the crowd, he chanted, `` We want <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>!'' demanding the now-vacant presidency for <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the playwright who spent four of the last 20 years in prison for insisting on exposing the hypocrisy and brutality of Communist rule. As with <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> and others after him, Czechoslovaks in crisis rallied to a man of letters rather than a politician. `` It is a wonderful day, wonderful,'' <PERSON> Machon </PERSON> said. `` How can I say it?'' Instead of trying, he hugged the reporter and wept again.

 Bison that blunder over the line from <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> are fair game for hunters again this winter, but park officials expect the harvest to be smaller than the 500 taken last season. Just how many of the big, furry, dumb beasts will wander outside the park boundaries to graze depends on how severe the winter is and how pinched the food supply within the park, officials say. Hunters are n't allowed to shoot buffalo in the park. But statements by a leading zoologist have added weight to the state's contention that the slaughter of wandering bison is necessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis among <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> cattle herds, despite the outrage such killings may produce. Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> specialist in the highly infectious bacterial disease, said previous claims by park officials that the bison bug could not be transmitted to cattle have proven false. `` <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> has spent in excess of $ 260 million of federal and state money to rid the domestic livestock of brucellosis,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` So you can see why you're not real crazy to get it back again.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, scientific adviser to a committee on brucellosis in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> could do more to eradicate brucellosis in the Yellowstone herds by isolating and slaughtering infected bison. But that would mean killing the animals on park property, and that is n't going to happen, he said. `` We're talking big-time political and economic concessions if they were to do that,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The Park Service says that unless scientists can prove brucellosis was not in the park when <PERSON> Yellowstone </PERSON> was created in 1872, it may classify the bacteria as a `` native species.'' Park policy forbids eradication of any native species. Eradicating brucellosis from the buffalo herd could prove useless if the organism is native to the area and simply reinfects the animals, said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. And the buffalo would no longer be a wild, free-roaming species if they were treated like domestic cattle, she said. Brucellosis, also called Bang's disease, causes domestic cattle to lose their calves. It can cause undulant fever _ characterized by recurring fever and aching joints _ in humans who get it through unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals. It generally ca n't be transmitted through meat. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been trying for decades to eliminate the disease from commercial herds. So far, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says, 27 states are free of brucellosis, with the disease most prevalent in the South. Brucellosis was eradicated from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> cattle in 1984. Last year, due to food shortages caused by the massive 1988 forest fires and an ensuing harsh winter, hundreds of hungry bison wandered north onto <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> cattle ranches. Hunters were called in to snag strays, and a record 569 bison were killed. Of these about half were found to be infected with brucellosis. Park officials counted 418 buffalo in the northern herd last week and estimate a park total of about 2,000 animals in the park's three major herds. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where most of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> is located, does not permit the shooting of stray bison. Animal rights activists sought unsuccessfully to stop last year's hunt, which to some was sadly reminiscent of the massive buffalo slaughter of a century ago that signalled the final taming of the Wild West. Although the bison season legally began Oct. 1, it does not actually start until and unless bison begin leaving the park. That usually happens in December, although it may not happen at all if the winter is mild. `` The biologists ca n't predict whether they'll move as they did last year,'' <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. `` We hope not. Maybe only a few will leave the park.'' Previously officials have said they expect no more than 200 to be harvested this year. In preparation for the hunt, 3,217 people have paid $ 5 to apply for a bison permit. If summoned by the wildlife department to hunt, Montanans pay $ 200 for a license, while non-residents pay $ 1,000. The hunt itself is less than thrilling. Buffalo are accustomed to seeing humans, and game wardens lead each hunter directly to the animal to be killed. The hunters shoot at close range at animals that often are standing still, grazing.

Former Senate President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and former Majority Leader <PERSON> Si </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettner </PERSON> go before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copenhaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Wednesday. Former Senate President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> faces sentencing Thursday. The three, all Democrats, are the latest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> public officials to fall to investigations by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, 35, also has nailed a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> member, a top <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide and two lobbyists on various corruption charges. And he obtained an indictment of a Charleston-area dog track owner who allegedly fed some of the corruption with dollars bet at the track. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> already was reeling from two forced resignations this summer. Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> stepped down to avoid a state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial on articles of impeachment after he was disgraced over the loss of $ 279 million in a state investment fund. Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> quit after conceding he changed his testimony during child custody proceedings. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> says his work is n't over yet, but he repeatedly has declined to elaborate. `` These cases do show the system is corruptible, as are most systems of government,'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>'s investigations have caused consternation in the Statehouse, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 30-4 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 80-20 in the House. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdette </PERSON> has asked <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> to conclude the investigation as soon as possible. `` It makes my job tougher,'' said <PERSON> Burdette </PERSON>, who at age 34 took over from <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president. `` It's undermined the public's confidence in state government,'' <PERSON> Burdette </PERSON> said. He supports the investigations, however. `` I think it's a necessary purge of that element of public officials in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 54, who spent 18 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> before becoming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president in 1988, resigned and pleaded guilty Sept. 11 to extorting $ 10,000 from dog track interests. He faces fines of $ 250,000 and 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s plea briefly interrupted the extortion trial of <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>, 43, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president from 1984 to 1987, when he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for an unsuccessful bid for governor. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> then became a prosecution witness against <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> admitted that he had pocketed $ 10,000. The scandal cost him a job as a bank executive vice president. Three days later, <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> pleaded guilty to extorting $ 5,000 from casino gambling interests in return for help on a bill to legalize gaming. The bill was not passed. Witnesses testified that <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, had pressed them for campaign donations. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> admitted being part of a laundering scheme to get $ 15,000 in gaming money for <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> and track and insurance lobbyist <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wymer </PERSON> pleaded guilty to federal income tax charges and both testified against <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wymer </PERSON> were sentenced to probation Thursday. Last December, state Delegate <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> was convicted of extortion. Lobbyist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandergrift </PERSON> revealed he paid money to <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> for help on a bill, and also said he lavished $ 160,000 on the Legislature in three years. <PERSON> Vandergrift </PERSON>, lobbyist for a group of foreign doctors who sought to ease restrictions on their obtaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical licenses, pleaded guilty to a federal income tax charge and spent less than six months in prison. He admitted he had not filed income tax returns for 16 years. <PERSON> Boettner </PERSON> pleaded guilty Sept. 23 to federal charges of income tax evasion for taking money from the same lobbyist who paid off <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boettner </PERSON>, who faces 20 years in prison and fines of $ 250,000, also testified against <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>. The lobbyist, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Annunzio </PERSON>, committed suicide Dec. 4, 1988, police said. Facing a February trial is dog track owner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. He is alleged to have paid $ 10,000 to <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and offered $ 13,000 to <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> through <PERSON> D'Annunzio </PERSON> for help on a bill that increased his track's take by $ 1.1 million.

<HEAD>Administration Considering New Fees on Generic Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to propose that generic drug companies pay `` user fees'' to help beef up government regulation of an industry reeling from a bribery and fraud scandal, sources say. The plan drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would impose registration fees on generic drug makers and charge them another fee for each application they file, said a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The fees would raise about $ 18 million as part of a $ 144 million package of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> fees the administration plans to propose in its fiscal 1991 budget, the source said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, like the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, favors user fees because they raise money without raising taxes. Plans to extend these fees to the drug industry have been proposed before, only to be axed by opponents on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. But this time, a plan directed at the generic drug industry is believed to have better chances, largely because of disclosures this year that some generic drug makers have bribed <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, cheated on safety tests and otherwise sidestepped <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. `` There has been some <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> concern about the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to do its job,'' said one source at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think you'll find they're more receptive to talking about <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> user fees than talking about user fees in general. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, demonstrates some evidence of a shift in opinion His panel uncovered the problems that have led to the bribery convictions of several generic drug company executives and <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees and the recall of more than 80 generic drugs. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, who has opposed user fees, `` is increasingly coming to favor them'' for the generic drug industry, as long as the money raised is used exclusively to strengthen the generic drug approval system, said an aide to the congressman who spoke on the condition he not be identified by name. The generic drug industry opposes the plan, which would hit generic companies only _ not brand name drug makers _ with a registration fee of about $ 6,000 on each company and another charge of about $ 17,000 for each generic drug application they submit for <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> review. `` It's like putting a tax on one side of the industry because of a couple of wrongdoers,'' said <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fensterer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Generic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. She said the fees could add up to `` a substantial amount of money,'' especially if the companies had to pay the application fee for each dosage of the same product. `` It starts to be very expensive.'' She added that `` any user fee is going to get passed on'' to consumers in the form of a price increase. Though she could not say how much the fees might add to the cost of a generic drug, she said it would not be large enough to make generics less competitive with the more expensive brand name products. The makers of brand name products also oppose user fees, even when the costs are imposed only on their competitors. Many say if the generic fees are approved it would only be a matter of time before a similar plan were imposed on the name brand companies. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> earlier this fall, the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing brand name makers, said the fees are unjustified because they `` would constitute the collection of revenues for services performed for the benefit of the general public and not for the specific benefit of an applicant or registrant.''

<HEAD>Capital Fears the Impact of Defense Cuts on the Industry's Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cuts in defense spending wo n't hurt the economy, analysts say, but could be traumatic for a workforce accustomed to satisfying a single complacent customer _ the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ instead of the competitive marketplace. A third of the nation's engineers and scientists work in defense and by some estimates 26 million people depend on the military economy, so there's considerable concern in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about the recoil that will be felt the defense budget is sharply reduced, as seems likely. Analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> thinks defense spending could be half its current size in 10 years. Both the new era opened by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and the pressures of the deficit point to dismantling the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Era defense buildup. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, says a number of firms are already planning `` downsizing.'' Some economists say the government also should be designing retraining, counseling, job search and relocation programs to ease the transition for defense workers. `` We put over a billion and a half dollars into building planes we did n't need'' to preserve jobs, says <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, who was an assistant defense secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I'd like to see the government come up with a plan to help people in a graceful and humane way, but you talk about an industrial policy in this country and they call you a communist,'' he says. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is looking at the issue. It has scheduled hearings for Tuesday on `` the economic consequences of reduced defense spending and the winding down of the Cold War.'' `` Depending on its size and speed, a substantial cut in defense spending phased in over a number of years could be one of the best things that could happen to the economy and should not be looked on as something likely to cause recession or unemployment,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultze </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser. `` One thing this country does not have is a surplus of is skilled engineers and skilled workmen.'' But conversion of defense workers, technicians, managers and plants to the civilian economy will be trickier than it was after World War II, when <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> stopped making tanks and resumed making DeSoto automobiles without missing a step. There was enormous pent-up demand for civilian products, too. But government planners cite society's needs _ for environmental cleanup, recycling of plastics, health care _ which may be able to adopt defense industry technology. `` I hope trade associations will see the relationship between a mayor who is worried about defense cuts in his community and about waste management; if you're smart, you can walk in and say, ` I can solve them both at once,''' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> of the Council on Economic Priorities. Defense managers have grown accustomed to working in the hothouse environment of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting, with no competition from overseas, a single, cooperative customer and cost-plus-profit accounting. `` Defense contractors are used to being told what the market is,'' says consultant <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Gansler </PERSON>, author of `` Affording Defense'' and a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement official in 1972-77. `` The commercial world is n't like that.'' But <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Melman </PERSON>, retired professor of industrial engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a pioneer advocate of planned conversion, rejects the view that the economy can absorb defense budget cuts without severe dislocations. He argues for an elaborate government efforts to prepare defense workers and to create productive civilian jobs for them. `` What are they going to work at?'' he demands. `` Making shoes? Eight-five percent of our shoes are imported. Consumer electronics? All imported. Machine tools? Half are imported.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Melman </PERSON> argues, defense managers are incapable of making the leap without retraining. `` No major military-serving enterprise has demonstrated an autonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switch that is needed to go civilian,'' <PERSON> Melman </PERSON> wrote in his book, `` Profits Without Production.'' `` If you unleash these people, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will turn into a third-rate economy,'' <PERSON> Melman </PERSON> says. `` They ca n't hack it. We will lose the capability of repairing the damage.'' Under a conversion legislation sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractors would be required to put 1.25 percent of receipts into a fund to pay the costs of economic adjustment. Laid-off workers might get 90 percent of their lost salaries while they are retrained for civilian jobs. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washingon </LOCATION> research outfit, says, `` Workers find work when the economy is healthy; you can plan the dickens out of what to do with a worker but when we're in a recession you ca n't do anything for him.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says although counseling, retraining and relocation programs are critical, `` income supplements, however, slow the adjustment process.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> proposed at a gathering of Central American presidents Sunday that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers in the region be given new powers and personnel to start disbanding the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels, a Nicaraguan source said. But after the summit's first day, the Nicaraguans were no closer to getting agreement on their proposal. `` Nothing has been done,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> told reporters after the day's session had ended. `` The demobilization of the Contras must be complied with,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must begin to function in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Also Sunday, the Salvadoran government rejected a truce proposed by leftist rebels fighting in that country. In return for demobilization of the Contras, the Nicaraguan government would consider resuming its cease-fire and `` technical talks'' with the leadership of the Honduras-based rebels, said a Nicaraguan source after the opening of the two-day summit. The source close to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> delegation, who refused to be identified, also said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was willing to allow the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> group to verify that no weapons are sent from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist rebels The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers were approved four months ago to monitor the voluntary repatriation of the Contras and make sure that one country's territory was not being used to launch attacks on a neighbor. The source, however, said the Nicaraguan government was not optimistic about acceptance of the proposal in view of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' `` bipartisan decision to keep the Contras alive until after the February elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> canceled its cease-fire with the Contras on Nov. 1, accusing them of disrupting registration for the Feb. 25 elections. Also at Sunday's opening session, the Salvadoran government rejected a cease-fire proposal by the leftist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels asked for the dismissal of seven high-ranking military leaders in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and `` full respect for human rights and democratic liberties of political and social organizations.'' The Salvadoran government instead asked the rebels to make a commitment not to launch attacks in urban areas and offered to resume negotiations in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> proposed a truce in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> from Dec. 12 through Jan. 15 `` to give the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and the government time to begin negotiations for a permanent cease-fire.'' <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> also proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> be given powers to verify such a cease-fire in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The five Central American presidents opened their meeting in an atmosphere of frustration and pessimism, hoping the superpowers would help rescue the flagging peace efforts in the region. `` We must face that reality'' that the superpowers' help is needed, said Costa Rican Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON>, who commented on the presidents' discussions. He added that regional agreements will not have much validity in those places where parties in the conflicts have close ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Attending the summit are presidents <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The presidents met briefly in a conference room, listened to a welcoming speech by Costa Rican Information Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>, and then went into a private session. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on Saturday had called the superpowers, without naming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` two-faced.'' He said they spoke about political solutions while encouraging military activities. `` We must demand from them a definition of their roles, what they have done themselves or through other countries to exert a negative or positive influence in the region,'' <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON> said. He did not suggest how the superpowers might respond, but one source, speaking with the condition of anonymity, said the two might send representatives or observers to negotiations between the warring parties. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports the Nicaraguan rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It also backs <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in its civil war against leftist insurgents. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accuses the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> of providing arms and aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the Salvadoran rebels. This summit had been scheduled to be held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but it was changed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> suspended relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> took the action after two small planes were found in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> carrying surface-to-air rockets that <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said were being flown from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. One plane crashed and the other was burned at a rural airstrip. Agreements reached at an August summit in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, called for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to disband by Dec. 5. However, their forces, headquartered in camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, have remained in place.

 <ORGANIZATION> Paint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, under court order to desegregate, became a magnet school 2 -LCB- years ago and attracted so many affluent children that it lost its federal funds to help the disadvantaged members of its original student body. In solving one problem, the magnet system created another _ how to retain services in the face of lost funds under the federal Chapter One program, which provides money for extra teachers and supplies to qualifying schools. It is a predicament experienced by magnet schools around the country _ including many of the 44 here in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Magnet schools provide specialized instruction in math, science, foreign languages and other areas. The idea has been pushed by administrators as a way to desegregate by attracting students voluntarily to schools away from their homes. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pushing to expand the concept nationwide as part of his effort to improve learning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. As of August, the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> awarded 54 grants totaling $ 113.6 million for magnet programs in 25 states. This compares with 38 federal grants totaling $ 75 million two years ago. Education Undersecretary <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> acknowledged that some magnet schools are losing Chapter One funds but insisted the problem is not widespread. He said there are no immediate plans to revise the law. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors pledged during the education summit to try and eliminate the stringent federal regulations attached to the Chapter One program. Before becoming a magnet school, Paint Branch was declared eligible for the federal funds because a large percentage of its 350-member student body qualified for the school lunch program and scored poorly on academic achievement tests. But when it began offering specialized instruction in math or science, 200 students were bused in, the student body swelled to 540 and the percentage of disadvantaged, low achievers dropped. Many of the old students were still at the school, but Paint Branch was told it was no longer eligible for Chapter One money. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, the Paint Branch principal, has done some juggling with budget and staff assignments to offer the advanced instruction that magnet schools promise, while still providing for the low-income, low-achieving students in her classrooms. `` It's very, very unfortunate,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>. `` Chapter One is a support program and we argue that support programs should be delivered one way or another.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> acknowledges, however, that a certain prestige comes with being a magnet school. The county school system has made these schools the cornerstone of its aggressive efforts to achieve academic success for all students. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, director of instructional support programs for the county, sought guidance from the state on how magnet schools could fight the loss of funds. As a result, about 19 magnet schools _ described as `` non-dedicated'' because not all of the youngsters receive the special courses _ are allowed to exclude the more affluent students from the calculations that determine eligibility for Chapter One. `` In essence, Chapter One regulations still operate and assume the existence of neighborhood schools _ schools attended by kids in the surrounding neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. `` The money flows to the community and not the kid.'' Paint Branch was not among those non-dedicated schools. To make up for the loss of federal funds, Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> made staffing changes that resulted in larger physical education and music classes. An instructional aide was hired with the extra money. Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said one benefit of hiring an instructional assistant without Chapter One money is that the school is not burdened by strict federal regulations and the instructors can be used more creatively. She also instituted `` dual assignment'' team teaching, where classes are combined for certain activities so some teachers can be free to provide extra time to certain Chapter One-eligible students. This year, eight second graders were targeted for the school's first quarter and `` we expect those children to make a good half-year gain in a short period of time. Under Chapter One, 100 youngsters received special educational services. `` We needed to create a different way to deliver services, extra intensive services to some of these children,'' she said. `` What we're trying is if we can give extraordinary services to a small group of children, we will have them ready to join the regular program by the first grading period.''

<HEAD>Report: Classified Study Told Bush of Soviet Reductions in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who maintained up until a month ago that Soviet defense spending was growing, received a classified <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report in May in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analysts expressed the opposite view, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense strategy shortly after his election for help in dealing with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A 26-page executive summary of the secret report states `` there is broad agreement within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence community'' that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` has decided to reverse a 20-year pattern of growth in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military spending and force structure in order to boost the civil economy and Soviet foreign policy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Until a month ago, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and senior advisers criticized what they said was an increase in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> defense spending as they pressed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve the nearly $ 300 billion defense budget for fiscal 1990. A White House spokesman interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> about the classified report said, `` When it was written, people were trying to prognosticate on the basis of Soviet announcements and very early indications of Soviet behavior. In fact, at that time, our estimates were that there were few, if any changes.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in sending two high-level envoys to smooth <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is virtually assuring himself of a new fight with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in return for benefits that remain unclear. The trip by National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, announced in the middle of the night Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, made it appear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is retreating from efforts to punish <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over last June's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. The move has given new grist to congressional critics who already had found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> timid in his response to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> crackdown, and who now suggest a curious contradiction: a hard-line <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when it comes to Soviet human rights policy, but a pushover for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` There seems to be a double standard,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is a leading congressional spokesman on the Far East. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> acknowledged Sunday that topics of discussion between the president's men and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership include the status of <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, a dissident who has taken sanctuary in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since the crackdown. He declined to say whether any progress was being made toward freeing <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>. Whether progress on that issue or some other potential gain was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s object, the domestic political risks are far more apparent. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said the president risks abdicating policymaking on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which `` more clearly reflects the will of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Unless the situation changes, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it returns in January is likely to force a new confrontation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over legislation formalizing and perhaps expanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and over a bill granting Chinese students automatic visa extensions if they are in danger of political persecution at home. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed both measures in the waning days of the 1989 congressional session. He said he the bills were unnecessary because he took administrative action to accomplish the same things and because the bills were an unwarranted intrusion on his foreign policy prerogatives. The Scowcroft-Eagleburger mission was a departure from past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> practice, in which the `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card'' usually has been played to gain leverage over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But at few times in history has the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needed leverage less than in the current climate, as communist rule crumbles in the Soviet sphere of influence. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> speculated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his two envoys, both proteges of former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, `` are living in the past.'' `` These guys have a deep personal stake in the Sino-American relation. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were all present at the creation,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. `` They're trying to preserve a relationship which they created and nurtured and which for a long time served -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- well.'' The price is the apparent subordination _ at least in this case _ of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to human rights. Democrats can be expected to complain loudly, and conservative Republicans who are uneasy over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rapprochement with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could well be brought to a boil by concessions to the more hard-line <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> regime. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> sought to defend the move, saying it was necessary to keep <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> within `` the international community.'' And he played down the significance of the trip, insisting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still must make progress on human rights before relations can be fully normalized. `` We've made it very clear, even in the aftermath of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, that as much as we deplored what happened there this is a very important relationship in terms of its geopolitical and geostrategic importance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that we wanted to try and find ways to preserve it,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 For more than a half-century the desolate beauty of a huge swamp west of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has drawn hunters and outdoors lovers, who have erected camps in the wilderness. In 1974, the swamp became a preserve under the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and the legal status of those camps _ some little better than flypaper shacks, others cinder-block structures with indoor plumbing, gas stoves and even lawns in front of them _ has come into question. About 100 people own camps on private land holdings that dot the Big Cypress National Preserve. But another 156 camps are on land that is now public property. Armed with a February ruling by a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> federal court, the park service has targeted the squatter camps for demolition. `` It really is pure and simple a legal issue,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagergren </PERSON>, park service superintendent of the 716,000-acre preserve, which is just north of <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. But for the squatters, the future of the camps is a bitter emotional issue. They are still disputing the ruling and have written 79 senators in a last-ditch attempt to save their holdings. With directions like `` take a right at the two pine trees deformed by lightning,'' the makeshift camps are n't easy to find. License plates tacked to a tree welcome visitors to camps with names like Firemen's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Scorpion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fat </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s after a one-hour airboat ride or a trip of up to four hours on swamp buggies _ souped-up, customized four-wheel drive trucks. But for all its forlorn quality, the land itself inspires the squatters to considerable eloquence. `` I walk out there and I'm in another world. I can not tell you spiritually or emotionally what that does. It's heaven,'' said <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomes </PERSON>, spokeswoman for a group that has sued to maintain the squatter camps. <PERSON> Nomes </PERSON> recalls a venemous cottonmouth snake that bit a boat engine, an alligator that attacked a tire, and admits there have been times when she's said to herself, `` Lady, you've got to be crazy to be out here.'' But, `` you see this gorgeous untouched cypress that is so big around it would take you 50 feet or better to get it around, and you see this lush pond next to it. It takes your breath away.'' Nomes, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said her first two dates with her husband-to-be were in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> 15 years ago. They've never owned a camp but have visited friends deep in Big Cypress for holidays, hunting trips and relaxation. The preserve is home to 11 endangered species, notably the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther, and 395 archaeological sites, primarily Indian burial mounds. Oil and gas exploration, hunting, off-road vehicles and cattle grazing are permitted in the preserve. The squatters hunt deer, turkeys and feral hogs. The squatters claim the park service is ignoring congressional intent by ousting them. No one bothered them when they built their camps on land titled to other owners before the preserve was created in 1974 with purchases from 47,000 landowners. A handful of camps were torn down earlier this year, but <PERSON> Fagergren </PERSON> waited for hunting season to die down before launching widespread demolition this month. `` We're being kicked out of the woods. That's what's happening,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Moller </PERSON>, who owns his own camp but fears all private interests in the preserve are being whittled away `` The park service likes everything to be totally regulated, totally controlled in their back yard, and they do n't want to see man's influence anywhere. The park service plans to build at least 50 primitive camps _ wooden platforms with roofs and screens _ for back-country campers to use on a first come-first serve basis, as in most of the nation's public camping areas. But <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, whose 20-year-old camp was demolished, says he'll use his own modified four-wheel drive <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> as a camp on wheels `` There's no way <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagergren </PERSON> or anyone else is going to keep me out of the swamp. It does n't make any difference to me if I have to be in a tent,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>. `` I will continue year round as I always have. I just wo n't have a camp to go to.''

<TEXT>
 A woman sought for 2 -LCB- years on a cocaine charge may have sent an unsigned letter that bears the essence of her cat-and-mouse game with her pursuers: `` Nya, nya, nya.'' The Colorado-postmarked letter that police received recently carried the defiant, handwritten message next to a rubber-stamp image of a cat on a fence screeching at the moon, police said. Because of its taunts, police have linked it to <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, 42, even has returned telephone calls from police, daring them to arrest her, authorities said. `` It's incredible,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogness </PERSON>. `` She is very persistent and bothersome _ bothersome is a real mild way to describe her.'' Informants have passed along <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>'s electronic pager numbers, Detective <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> True </PERSON> said. He has called the Los Angeles-area numbers, and <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> has returned his calls. `` She just kind of laughs and says, ` Catch me if you can,''' said True. `` I've never had one in 18 years call me up and say, ` Catch me if you can.''' <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> has been sought since June 1987, when officers raided her apartment and found cocaine with a street value of $ 85,000, said True. Her husband, <PERSON> Darel </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenhart </PERSON>, was arrested and pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. He walked away from a drug rehabilitation program in January 1988 and is being sought, authorities said. `` I think there's a good chance that they will be together,'' True said. `` Maybe we'll get two for the price of one.''

<HEAD>House Panel Says Administration Plays Down Safety of Abortions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-abortion politics at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has `` interfered with scientific evidence and research'' on abortion in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel contends. Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, charged in a report released Sunday that the federal government has failed to report evidence of the relative safety of abortions for women. His panel concluded after an investigation that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> has censored research on abortion, and urged that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> take steps to assure public health research is not affected by politics. It also recommended increased federal support for contraceptive research to help decrease the 1.5 million abortions obtained by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women every year. `` This report provides important evidence of the relative safety of abortion for women, since more than 90 percent of abortions performed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> are much safer than pregnancy and childbirth, and even the most dangerous types of legal abortions are equal in risk to carrying a pregnancy to term,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. His statement was included with the report by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, based on an investigation by its subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations, which <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> chairs. In charging that scientific research by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has been `` restricted by the political considerations'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations, the committee cited a change in <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> statistics gathering. Five years ago, it said, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> stopped comparing the mortality and morbidity of women who had abortions with women carrying pregnancy to term. Comparisons had indicated women were between seven and 25 times more likely to die from childbirth than from legal abortion, the report said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, assistant secretary for health at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, said that while <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was director of <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> from 1983 until last winter, `` there was not censorship on the abortion issue.'' Six Republican House members filed a dissent, charging the report was written with `` pro-abortion bias'' and `` paints a misleading and inaccurate picture.'' The panel conducted an investigation into the efforts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to have its surgeon general, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, prepare a report on the health effects of abortion on women. After conducting meetings and research, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> in January wrote to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saying there was insufficient information on which to base a report. A draft of <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s unreleased report was made public by the subcommittee in March. It concluded that valid scientific studies have documented that modern abortion is a medically safe procedure and does not increase a woman's subsequent risk of infertility, miscarriage or premature births. It concluded the frequency of long-term psychological effects is uncertain, however. In releasing its final report, the panel included material from transcripts it subpoenaed of 27 confidential meetings <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> held with anti-abortion and abortion-rights advocates. According to the subcommittee, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> stated in those meetings that legal abortion was safer than pregnancy and childbirth and posed no public health risks to women's mental or physical health. It concluded <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` not consistent with the weight of evidence'' or <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s own statements on health effects of abortion. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> did not respond to a reporter's call for comment last week. The report cited <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> evidence that the risk of death from abortion doubles every two weeks after eight weeks gestation, and that after the 16th week the risks are similar to those for childbirth. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the report Sunday, saying officials there had not seen it.

<TEXT>
 V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the man who reluctantly agreed to become prime minister of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has set out to prove he's in control As head of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first minority government, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> does n't have a blank check to launch the revolutionary economic and social reforms that could allow <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to join the ranks of the great powers in the next century. But political observers and associates say the 58-year-old prime minister has two things working in his favor _ a clean slate and a clean name. Within a week of taking the oath of office, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had reassured two embittered religious minorities they indeed have an important place in officially secular, predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. He appointed influential colleagues to lower-ranking Cabinet posts, thereby denying them new power bases. The more powerful posts went to men with the experience to push through change and the reputations for incorruptibility. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s five-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition denied Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a majority in the Nov. 22-26 elections and brought down the <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> family dynasty that dominated Indian politics since the country became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 42 years ago. But <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> needs the continuing allegiance of both the Hindu fundamentalists and the Communists for his middle-of-the-road alliance to muster a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Given the fragilility of this alliance, many political observers are skeptical of the new government's ability to enact any major changes in the world's largest democracy, a country of 880 million people skewed between abject poverty and space-age achievements. The problems <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> inherited are enormous, but the mild-mannered, introverted politician who reluctantly agreed to head <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s newest government has not been shy about what he intends to accomplish. He lists his missions thus: to eliminate poverty, halt rising food prices that have doubled in the past year, decentralize federal power, reduce bureaucratic regulations and political meddling, open the economy to Western investors eager to do business with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and patch up differences with neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Foreign policy is a low priority for change. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has said he will not deviate from the course <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has already charted between the world's superpowers. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, he said, will remain non-aligned and continue to build on its friendly relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The first major test of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s government _ provided it survives a confidence vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> later this month _ will come during legislative elections in nine states in March and April. All but two of the states now are dominated by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> loses, it will split and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> alliance will become stronger. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> defends its territory, it will give renewed confidence to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his party and weaken our coalition. Then any constructive cooperation between us and the opposition will end,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> member, speaking on condition of anonymity. But analysts say <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s most immediate problems stem from factional disputes within his own <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest group in the five-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Those differences surfaced again recently during wrangling for Cabinet posts. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> appointed a Moslem as head of the powerful Home Ministry, a move seen as an attempt to span the growing rifts between the majority <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON> and the minority Moslems that erupted into riots in which at 300 people were killed this fall. Later, he visited the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the hotbed of the Sikh separatist movement, and offered prayers at the Sikhs' holiest shrine, the Golden Temple The visit by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Hindu, was the first by an Indian prime minister in more than five years and an effort to end the bloody secessionist campaign that has claimed more than 12,000 lives since 1982. `` A nation is not a map on a piece of paper,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> later said. `` It lives in the hearts of the people, and if the hearts are divided, the nation stands divided. We will not allow this to happen.'' Despite speculation that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> would keep the finance portfolio, which he held for two years under <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, he gave it to a veteran lawmaker who is expected to continue, if not speed up, the reforms <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> sees as needed to make <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> a competitor in the world markets. Instead, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> kept the defense portfolio, a signal that he will wield considerable power since defense spending has received the biggest chunk of the national budget. The move prompted speculation <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> would be directly involved in investigation into controversial arms deals during the <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> administration. Government corruption was the linchpin in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and earned <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> the nickname, `` The New Mr. Clean,'' a reference to similar promises that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> made to clean up <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s bureacracy <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was buffeted by accusations that highly placed <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> received up to $ 50 million in kickbacks from the Swedish arms firm <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, winner of a 1986 contract to sell $ 1.4 billion worth of howitzers to the Indian government. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s denials that any Indians profited from the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> deal paled before detailed newspaper investigations, but the accusations have not been proved. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said there will be an investigation, but not a vendetta. `` I want to make it clear that we will not be vindictive,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` No scandal will be cooked up against him or anyone else. The law of the land will prevail.''

 He'll come in out of the sky, then quickly disappear. Folks here have been looking forward to his annual visit, and some are even thinking of treats for him to eat. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>? No, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. For 25 years, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been coming to hunt at the Lazy F ranch of <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>. The annual chase for scurrying quail is scheduled this year for the week after Christmas. Even though he has a complement of press and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> manages to pull a disappearing act. He arrives at nearby <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, then vanishes onto the ranch. `` I did n't know he was here last year until after he left,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, a Bee County courthouse secretary. `` Actually, to get to the ranch he hunts on, I do n't think he even comes through town,'' said County Judge <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Streitman </PERSON>. But people have ways of knowing when he's around. For instance, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moya </PERSON> stays a little busier at her <PERSON> Moya </PERSON>'s Mexican Cafe. She said she will have to stock extra food and hire extra help again just to handle the business during this year's three-day visit. Last year, Ms. <PERSON> Moya </PERSON> served `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> burgers'' with plenty of jalapenos to the entourage that accompanied the president. The cafe is the only restaurant in <LOCATION> Berclair </LOCATION>, a small town northeast of <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> that is near <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>'s ranch.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says new openings for democracy and peace around the world make this Christmas `` a moment to be remembered.'' `` For 40 years the world has known only a grim and joyless peace, hard and cold,'' the president said Sunday. `` But now, everywhere, you see signs of a warmer, more hopeful peace, like a candle which flickers in the distance. It beckons, encourages, casts a bright glow in the world's darkest corners.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke on stage at the end of the taping of an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television special, `` Christmas in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' that will air Dec. 18. Flutist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON>, singers <PERSON> Diahann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton-John </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy glee club and the local <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> choir provided the entertainment at the National Building Museum. The show kicked off two weeks of parties and celebrations leading up to Christmas. `` Christmas in 1989 will be a moment to be remembered, a moment of new faith and freedom, new hope for peace,'' said the president, sporting a red and green tie. `` Change comes and challenges us. Freedom comes and lights a candle that must never be put out,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Let every candle we light, every hymn we offer, symbolize the hope of a new century, hope of mankind that there will indeed be peace on earth, goodwill, and the blessings of freedom for all people.'' The event benefited the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The show included taped footage of Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reading to children at the hospital's Christmas party last Wednesday. The Bushes are hosting a congressional ball at the White House tonight, kicking off a nearly nightly series of holiday parties from now until Christmas, which the Bushes will spend at Camp David, Md. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will light the national Christmas tree on the Ellipse this Thursday night, continuing a tradition that President <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> began in 1923. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will also host a Hanukkah celebration at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 21.

 <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> have long since died, but at the gala events this week celebrating the 50th anniverary of `` Gone With the Wind'' they'll be remembered again and again. For one thing, organizers have invited five pairs of <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> look-alikes. For another, 11 survving cast members, many of whom were children when the 1939 movie was made, will have their own stories to tell of the legendary stars, who both died in the 1960s. The cast members will attend a private reunion Thursday and are expected Friday night at a re-creation of the movie's Dec. 15, 1939, world premiere. Fifty years ago, the premiere was the biggest social event in the city's history. The governor declared Dec. 15 a holiday, and an estimated 1 million people turned out to catch glimpses of the visiting <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> royalty and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s own <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the former newspaper writer whose 1936 novel `` Gone With the Wind'' catapulted her to reluctant celebrity. The `` re-premiere'' will be held at the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> since the <LOCATION> Loew </LOCATION>'s Grand Theater, site of the 1939 premiere, is no longer standing. A competition between the <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> look-alikes is set for Tuesday, and guests in antebellum dress will attend a `` Gone With the Wind'' ball Thursday night. <PERSON> Cammie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, the actress who played <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s young daughter, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, said the cast reunion will be a chance for her to reminisce with others who appeared in the movie `` I was 4 -LCB- when they did the filming,'' the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, resident said in a telephone interview, adding that she remembers `` about 12 snapshots, images'' of the experience. `` You do n't really know how much you remember because people have told you some things,'' she said. `` I certainly remember the pony.'' In the movie, as in the book, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> dies in a fall from a pony. `` <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> I remember being a very nice, nice ` daddy,''' Ms. <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> added. `` He was considerate of me, my mother said. I do n't remember <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> at all. Others expected for the cast reunion include <PERSON> Butterfly </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, who played Prissy; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, all of whom played <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, at various ages; <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiss </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> as an infant; and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s sisters. Many of the anniversary activities are sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, a division of entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s media empire. Turner acquired the rights to `` Gone With the Wind'' in 1985 when he bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s huge film library. He paid for a restored version of the film that has made a 50th anniversary tour of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> movie houses this year. `` It's his favorite movie,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a Turner spokesman. Other activities include a champagne breakfast, which is a re-creation of an event from the 1939 gala; tours of historic homes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> set her fictional plantation <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>; an exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; and lectures on <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who died in 1949, and her book. Turner's SuperStation TBS will broadcast the restored version of the film three times during the week.

 A campaign march by hundreds of opposition supporters turned into a riot Sunday. Police said at least one person was killed and witnesses said 20 people were injured. Two vehicles were burned, and a private home and the local headquarters of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> were sacked. The fighting broke out during a rally by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, when a group of about 20 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> loyalists and opposition followers exchanged insults and then blows in this town of 15,000 people about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Sandinistas accused sympathizers of the opposition coalition of starting the riot. Opposition leaders admitted their people took part but accused the Sandinistas of provoking the riot, saying Sandinista infiltrators posing as opposition militants encouraged the attack on the houses and vehicles. The local organizer of the opposition coalition, <PERSON> Jeremias </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON>, said he saw a police officer draw his gun and shoot a man in the arm. Lt. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION> police chief, said police were following orders in not intervening in the riot until it was nearly over. `` We had instructions not to get near the march,'' <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said. `` Going to the disturbances meant giving them -LRB- UNO -RRB- a pretext to say that we were there to repress them.'' National Opposition Union leaders have accused Sandinista gangs of disrupting earlier opposition rallies for the Feb. 25 elections. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said one person was killed, but did not elaborate. Witnesses said at least 20 people were injured. Witnesses said groups of opposition activists attacked a house that was used by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> as a campaign office as well as another nearby house. They said some activists set fire to a motorcycle and to a jeep with license plates from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON>, the opposition coalition organizer, said he arrived as opposition sympathizers were stoning the Sandinista headquarters. He said a Sandinista from the nearby town of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION> was leading the mob. `` I told them that this man was an infiltrator and they beat him up,'' <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> said. `` In the fray, he dropped this pin and I grabbed it and showed it to them.'' <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> showed an enamel-and-gold pin commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution. Such pins are awarded by the Sandinista Front for meritorious service to the party. He said the man, whose name he did not know, fled. <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> said by the time he tried to calm the mob, police had arrived. He said a 9-year-old girl who was walking next to him during the march was hit on the head by a rock `` which was meant for me'' and she was knocked out. He said at least three men were stabbed and other people were attacked with broken bottles and hit with stones and sticks. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee member, said he and 12 other people were in the party headquarters when it was attacked by a mob of about 200 people. He said they escaped through a back room. After destroying furniture and other articles in the Sandinista headquarters, the crowd moved to the second building, allowing its occupants to leave before stoning it. Both buildings were heavily damaged.

<HEAD>Aquino Shows Resolve In Coup Aftermath But No Sign Of Compromise</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has shown steely resolve in confronting the armed challenge to her rule. But it is unclear whether she is ready to move quickly on the manifold problems that helped trigger the latest coup attempt. On Saturday, rebel soldiers gave up the last stronghold they seized Dec. 1, when thousands of military mutineers rose up against her in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Legazpi </PERSON> and elsewhere. But the crisis facing the Aquino government is far from over. More than half the estimated 3,000 rebels who battled government troops in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area remain at large, including key leaders such as Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> and renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. Troops who did not join the revolt issued statements of support. The grave social and political problems the mutineers tried to exploit remain unaddressed. In one indication of the mood, share prices tumbled on the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today in the first day of trading since the coup attempt was launched. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Composite Stock Index of 25 selected issues fell 8 percent. Throughout the coup attempt, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> adamantly refused to compromise with the mutineers, even as rebel planes rocketed the Malacanang presidential palace. `` I promise you that I will continue to serve the Filipino people, and I will offer every moment of my life, and I shall never let evil triumph in our country,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Sunday during funeral services for a loyal officer killed in the struggle. `` Those who are guilty will be meted out the full penalties.'' After each of the five previous coup attempts, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the same bold, belligerent statements. Action proved weaker than rhetoric. Few participants were ever punished. Those who were sentenced to prison by military courts remain under house arrest pending review of their sentences. This time, however, the administration may be considering a firmer response. Last week, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a national state of emergency. Specific powers made available to the president must be ratified by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But congressional sources say the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are prepared to grant her broad, temporary powers to suspend strikes, conduct searches and seizures without warrants and take other measures to restore order and prevent another coup. The emergency declaration has been widely applauded as a necessary step and welcome sign of firmness, although some prominent human rights advocates expressed concern that it could infringe on personal freedoms. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> also appears ready to confront civilian opposition politicians long suspected of having prior knowledge of coup attempts, if not having been part of the financing and planning. During a speech Friday to a crowd of more than 100,000, she singled out Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and her pro-Marcos cousin, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, for possible involvement in the coup attempt. But others believe Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> must also come to grips with the fact that her popularity has been declining in the face of rising prices, a breakdown in law and order, infrastructure decay and alleged corruption. `` The bottom line here is: Can democracy work in the Third World country?'' wrote former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> in the Philippine Daily Star. `` Can it work in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with one of the highest poverty threshholds ... with a population that has doubled in 30 years ... So far, it has n't.'' Those behind the latest coup attempt apparently timed their attacks in hopes of expoiting public discontent. Most Filipinos oppose a military-backed government but still believe Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has been ineffective in coping with the nation's problems. `` It is time to show righteous anger and steely determination, not only against enemies of the state but also against the sorry state of the nation,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Abaya </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. After coup attempts in November 1986 and August 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> revamped her Cabinet. Many political commentators believe she must take the same step this time. Respected commentator <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Standard that some advisers are urging a such change but others feel the show of support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> at Friday's rally indicate changes in the Cabinet are not necessary. Before the rally, columnist <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Capino </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> that many people wanted to display solidarity with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> but that a large crowd `` would give President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> the impression that they are happy with her administration.'' Government sources complain bitterly about inefficiency in the presidential palace staff, where rival factions block directives they do n't like. Sources familiar with the palace staff, speaking on condition of anonymnity, also complain that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s advisers have isolated her from the problems of ordinary Filipinos.

 Friends of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman being held in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have recorded four songs on her behalf, and the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he plans to meet with Salvadoran and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to help gain her release. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he hoped to have the meetings concerning 28-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> this week. She is being held on suspicion of helping leftist insurgents after authorities uncovered a weapons cache that was buried in the garden of her rented <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> home. She has insisted that she knew nothing about the weapons. `` <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, you are not alone,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the several hundred people at an ecumenical service Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` We shall seek to meet with the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> ambassador to this country We shall seek to meet with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- personnel in this country. We shall seek to visit you. We shall seek to bring you home.'' There was no answer early today at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, asked the audience to join him in prayer. `` I would like you all to bow your heads and pray for the release of my daughter,'' he said. `` Please send <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> home soon safely to us. ... I know she's doing your work, and I know she's innocent. The four-song cassette, `` For <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>,'' was recorded Saturday by folk singer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. He said he plans to send it Casolo in the Salvadoran prison. The cassette also is being sent to radio stations around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said he met Casolo six years ago at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where she lived for two years and was active in the sanctuary movement of harboring illegal aliens fleeing turmoil in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bush Received Secret Report on Soviet Military Cuts in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who until last month maintained that Soviet defense spending was growing, received a classified <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report in May in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analysts expressed the opposite view, a published report says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the secret study of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense strategy shortly after his election as an aid for dealing with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions A 26-page executive summary of the report states that `` there is broad agreement within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence community'' that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` has decided to reverse a 20-year pattern of growth in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military spending and force structure in order to boost the civil economy and Soviet foreign policy.'' Until a month ago, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and senior advisers criticized what they said was an increase in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> defense spending as they pressed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve the nearly $ 300 billion defense budget for fiscal 1990. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in interviews released Sunday that he gained `` more respect'' for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit and thinks he can trust the Soviet leader. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is `` up against some tremendous problems and is determined to solve them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> magazine. Asked if his view of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had changed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` There is certainly an element of respect for the way he has managed the change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and -LRB- his -RRB- determination to fight for perestroika reform at home. `` I have more respect for him than I did back when he first came into office, back when I first met him or when I saw him last year.'' Perestroika, the Russian word for restructuring, is shorthand for the economic changes that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is pushing to revive the ailing Soviet economy. `` I think I can trust <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview in Time magazine. `` I looked him in the eye, I appraised him. He was very determined. Yet there was a twinkle. He is a guy quite sure of what he is doing. He has got a political feel.''

<TEXT>
 The dollar closed higher against the yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Monday, while stock prices also rose. The dollar closed at 144.65 yen, up 0.38 yen from its 144.27-yen close on Friday and slightly higher than its opening of 144.50 yen. It ranged between 144.45 and 144.73 yen during the day. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues gained 28.61 points, closing at 37,752.67. On Friday, the index lost 134.05 points after marking new highs on each of the previous four days. In the currency market, the dollar was apparently bolstered by dollar-buying intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the market opened and by purchases by major trading companies, dealers said. A large number of export contracts usually due for settlement on Monday tightened demand for the dollar in the morning, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, does not comment on its market activities. `` There is no particular -LRB- market-affecting -RRB- news'' this morning, said <PERSON> Shinzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He indicated, however, that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> dealers were taking their cue from a strengthening of the dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday. Trading got off to a slow start on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as participants waited to see the market's performance after its strong advances last week, traders said. After opening lower, the Nikkei rebounded toward the end of the morning session on buying of natural resource-oriented shares, they said. Volume was estimated at 380 million shares, down from an estimated 550 million shares Friday.

He escaped injury when he made an emergency landing in a tobacco field, but his aircraft was damaged. `` I'm going to have to make new reindeer,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` All the reindeer got annihilated.'' The modified gyrocopter has a side panel shaped and painted to appear as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> in his sleigh, being pulled by his reindeer. At Halloween, he painted the craft to appear as a witch on a broom. `` I'm hoping there is enough time between now and Christmas to get it back together,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` There are going to some dissappointed kids if they do n't see Santa Claus flying.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he builds and flies the craft because of the enjoyment it gives children. He said he learned a few things from Saturday's accident. For one, he needs a better tail rudder to make a more airworthy sleigh.

 Local officials have found a way to get responses to a long survey on the town's rapid growth: a reward. Officials in the southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> community of 3,500 people are giving respondents a shot at a $ 250 lottery. So far, 26 percent of townspeople have responded _ quite an improvement from another recent survey to which less than 2 percent responded. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> is required by state law to adopt a comprehensive growth plan by 1991. The population of the town in southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has increased 66 percent since 1980. `` At first we thought this was kind of tacky _ like an insult to have a drawing for money, when out of the goodness of their hearts and civic duty people should respond,'' said Chairwoman <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we knew that in the past this had n't worked. So we decided to try a lottery,'' she said. Questionnaires, with lottery tickets stapled on, were sent out in November. Residents have until January to respond. Committee members chose the $ 250 figure because they figured it would be large enough to attract attention, `` but small enough to not lead to lying and cheating and stealing,'' said Town Manager <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauter </PERSON>. Some want more money. `` I'd say $ 250 does n't do much for people these days,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phoenix </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>'s Sandwich Shop. `` If they'd have made it $ 1,000, they'd have gotten a lot more responses.''

<HEAD>5 Weeks After Racial Incident, MacMurray College has Quieted Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Five weeks after racist letters were sent to black students at <ORGANIZATION> MacMurray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, the incident has prompted race-awareness activities and, some say, a new climate on the campus. `` Before the letters, there was a lot of tension, but now it's suppressed, and everybody's making an effort,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a black freshman at the small liberal-arts school `` I think before the letters <PERSON> MacMurray </PERSON> was to some extent a closed community with the blacks on the outside looking in,'' said <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, a black sophomore. `` Since the letters, I've noticed a lot more interaction between blacks and whites.'' On Nov. 2, letters containing racial slurs and threats were found in campus mailboxes of the 35 to 40 black students at the 620-student school, as well as that of the college's only black staff member. The letters were addressed to students by name and campus mail box number. They contained epithets such as `` Uncle Tom'' and slurs specifically tailored to each recipient, according to students who saw the letters. Four days later, students marched in protest across the campus of the private college in west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> says his department has n't identified a suspect, although police were able to take fingerprints from the letters `` It's pretty much a dead issue right now,'' Weeks said. Student body president <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> holds little hope that the culprit will be found. `` I do n't think we'll ever know who wrote the letters,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, a junior majoring in education for the deaf. `` I do n't think it would be possible to fingerprint everyone on campus. Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who is white, said it may be best that the writer remain unknown. `` If it's a white student, it's going to cause a lot of tension between blacks and whites,'' she said. `` If it's a black student, the blacks will be embarrassed. I think many students would feel better not knowing.'' Since the letter-writing, there have n't been any racial incidents reported on campus. The college has sponsored a forum for students to talk about racism, and seminars on cultural diversity and a workshop on racism are in the works. Officials say more classes may include subjects of black interest. The student government is planning an ethnic festival and the sale of T-shirts promoting racial equality, and the administration plans to make <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday a holiday. College president <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he wants to recruit more black faculty members but that it's difficult because blacks who receive doctoral degrees are intensely sought by other colleges. `` It's just very difficult because of the small number in the pipeline and because in a school of this size and in a town this size there's just not the support network of other professional minorities,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Our best hope to recruit additional role models is going to be from our own students, and that's going to take a while.'' Philosophy professor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said the incident gave a false picture of <PERSON> MacMurray </PERSON>, which he said has traditionally welcomed black students. Black senior <PERSON> Marquita </PERSON> <PERSON> Archie </PERSON>, who said she cried each day for five days after the incident, said the letters reflected the bias that is everywhere. Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, the student body president, said the students now realize that. `` I think it affected the majority of the students on campus and opened a lot of students' eyes about racial tension,'' she said. `` I know it opened mine.''

 Thousands of abortion-rights and AIDS activists converged on <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Cathedral, forcing Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> to temporarily halt Mass as police carried out dozens of protesters on stretchers. More than 100 people were arrested and three police officers sustained minor injuries, authorities said. Inside, where 43 were arrested, demonstrators chained themselves to pews and lay in the center aisle. Outside, about 4,500 people marched along Fifth Avenue, with some holding signs such as `` Curb Your Dogma'' and `` Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON>.'' Others chanted `` Teach safe sex,'' and `` Just say no is not enough.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked the congregation Sunday to stand and join him in reciting prayers. He was forced to skip his sermon, handing out copies instead. Then, as dozens of police hauled protesters away on bright orange stretchers, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> resumed the Mass. Gay activists have staged several demonstrations at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s since 1987, when <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> barred a homosexual Roman Catholic group, Dignity, from using church buildings. Those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing, said Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The protest was organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power -LRB- ACT UP -RRB- and Women's Health Action and Mobilization -LRB- WHAM! -RRB-. `` We demand to bring our issues to the cardinal directly and that's what we did,'' said organizer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendolia </PERSON>. A statement by the groups said they `` do not challenge anyone's right to worship as they choose. However, they criticized <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> for his opposition to abortion and his vocal support of Operation Rescue, which has blockaded abortion clinics; for lobbying against education about safer sex and condoms, especially in schools; and for his opposition to gay rights legislation. `` They are not moral issues. They are political issues,'' <PERSON> Mendolia </PERSON> said. `` Their religious bullying infringes on the personal liberties of all Americans.'' Church officials, anticipating the well-publicized demonstration, cleared the church after the 9 a.m. Mass, then searched the bags of everyone coming in for the 10:15 a.m. Mass. The cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after Mass started, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwilling </PERSON>, an archdiocese spokesman. Police were stationed throughout the massive cathedral, even at the altar rail. After the Mass, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the protest left him anguished. `` The archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> must of course always preach what the church preaches, teach what the church teaches,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` I can not believe that anyone, even those who hate what the church teaches, would respect me for a moment if I taught anything else.'' The congregation applauded enthusiastically. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> later said he was particularly upset that one person who stood in line for Holy Communion broke the wafer and threw it on the floor. Among those inside was Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who is Jewish and has differed with <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> on the issues that sparked the protest but showed up `` to defend the cathedral.'' `` You do n't have a right to disrupt a church service,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` That's the law.''

 A disbarred lawyer just out of jail becomes deputy premier with partial responsibility for police. A dissident journalist who also has done time, and most recently stoked coal in a factory, is named foreign minister. A bank clerk takes over the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The appointments Sunday show just how utterly a 3-week-old peaceful popular revolt has turned Czechoslovak politics on end. The swift, smooth revolution has ousted the leaders of the crackdown that followed the suppression of the 1968 ` Prague Spring' reforms Out are those who stripped of party membership half a million Communists deemed too reformist. Many of the persecuted also lost all access to anything but the most menial jobs. Now, those who suffered are returning with remarkable ease to take center stage in national politics. The revolt has brought the ebullient <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, working as a stoker since he last got out of jail in 1982, back to his original profession, journalism _ a job he lost in the crackdown on `` Prague Spring'' reforms. The only difference is that instead of writing stories, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> gave them out, as spokesman for the Civic Forum opposition coalition. Now, he is to serve as foreign minister, a role Civic Forum thinks he is suited for because of his fluent English and French and experience in the Far East and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the mid-1960s as a correspondent for state radio. After he lost that job and his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> membership, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> worked in the archive department of a design institute and wrote three books published in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but banned in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Once he signed the Charter 77 human rights document in 1977 and became a leading member of <ORGANIZATION> VONS </ORGANIZATION>, a movement keeping track of political prisoners, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> found himself increasingly under police harassment. In May 1979, the police arrested <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other leading <ORGANIZATION> VONS </ORGANIZATION> activists. In November that year <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> was sentenced to three years in jail. Since release, he had worked as a stoker, swapping shifts in a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> factory with another dissident, <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>. A far more recent ex-prisoner now in the government is <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, a dissident barred from practicing law since 1977 and a well-known Roman Catholic activist in his native <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> was released from jail only two weeks ago, one of the first political prisoners to be freed as the Communists scrambled to meet the demands of pro-democracy demonstrators. <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, 45, was arrested in mid-August along with four other dissidents for signing an appeal to Slovaks to lay flowers in memory of those who died in the August 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ` Prague Spring' reforms. Authorities charged <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON>, another Slovak dissident named Sunday as head of a new federal office of press and information, with incitement and subversion charges that could have jailed them for up to 10 years. <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON> was released before his trial and acquittal last month, but <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> was not allowed out. A bespectacled, balding man with polite, careful manners, <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> won a reputation in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> as a defense lawyer or legal adviser on human rights cases, and the publisher of the underground newspaper, <PERSON> Bratislavske </PERSON> <PERSON> Listy </PERSON>. On Sunday, he was named one of two first deputy premiers in the new government. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, the new finance minister, also suffered for his beliefs. He was expelled from the country's leading institute of economic research at the age of 26 in 1970 and worked in lowly positions at the state bank through the 1970s. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>'s free market economic beliefs may not go down well with Czechoslovak workers, who have enjoyed a relatively cozy life for relatively little work for the past four decades. It will be up to <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a worker at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s giant CKD heavy engineering works, to safeguard the proletarian interests as Labor Minister. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 48, is a blacksmith by profession. He started work at <ORGANIZATION> CKD </ORGANIZATION> in 1962, and enrolled to study economics in 1969, but was thrown out the next year during the crackdown.

<TEXT>
 A walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> scientists, engineers and technicians remains a longshot, but they may reject contract offers that are smaller than production workers won in a 48-day strike, union leaders say. Boos and sardonic laughter punctuated a meeting of more than 2,000 of the 17,600-member <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest union. The union has never struck and lacks a strike fund. But many members carried signs and some distributed leaflets calling for contract rejection and a walkout at the world's largest commercial jet builder. Also Sunday, a contract similar to one accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union was ratified by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 1069. The pact covers about 3,000 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ridley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, and is retroactive to Oct. 5. The Machinists' settlement, which followed the longest strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 41 years, provided `` the economic guidelines that we could follow,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION>, hooting was loudest when union president <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bofferding </PERSON> emphasized that negotiators had n't made a recommendation `` Take a stand!'' several people shouted. Ballots were mailed to members' homes Friday, along with 30-page booklets listing all changes from the three-year pacts that expired Dec. 1 but were extended indefinitely as talks continued. The vote count is set for Dec. 18. One three-year offer covers 15,000 scientists and engineers. The other is for 12,800 technical support workers, with almost all members of both units in the Puget Sound area. Engineers and scientists, who earn an average of nearly $ 40,000 a year, would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no further increases. Technicians, with average pay of about $ 28,000, would get annual increases of 3 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of 10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent. The three-year contract for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> included annual wage increases of 4, 3 and 3 percent; bonuses of 10, 5 and 4 percent of gross pay and an improvement in the cost-of-living formula from about 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent. The outcome of the voting is anyone's guess, <PERSON> Bofferding </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` I believe, though, the general response of our people to the wage proposal is fairly negative,'' he added. `` There's a reasonably good chance that the members would not accept the contract, based on the mood tonight,'' said negotiator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Guilder </PERSON> of the technicians' unit. Chief corporate spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said it was unfair to compare the Machinists' contract, which covers 57,800 workers, to offers to the engineers and technicians was unfair. `` The problem is when you try to compare a professional to a guy sweeping the factory floor. That is not legitimate,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An international ski and dog sled team trekking across <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is expected to reach the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> this week, according to an expedition spokeswoman. `` They are about 50 miles from the pole right now, and they have been averaging 25 miles per day,'' the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasperini </PERSON>, said Sunday. They could reach the pole tonight or Tuesday, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Antarctica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expedition </ORGANIZATION> already has traveled more than 1,900 miles since leaving the northern tip of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on July 27. The men and dogs trudged the length of the treacherous peninsula in winter, never tried before. The group's co-leader, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, made history three years ago when he led a similar assault on the North Pole. <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> scuttled plans to broadcast live from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>, but hopes to rush out fresh video for the third of its five prime-time specials on the expedition, to be aired next Sunday. For all the fanfare, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> is little more than a milepost. The goal is to reach Mirnyy, a Soviet science station on the continent's <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> shore. That's another 1,600 miles and three months to complete the $ 11 million, seven-month journey. `` I say Mirnyy or die,'' <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> said earlier. The expedition's other members are co-leader <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyarsky </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Funatsu </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahe </PERSON> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite television father and author of the book `` Fatherhood,'' says he's estranged from his real-life daughter <PERSON> Erinn </PERSON>, whom he calls irresponsible and untrustworthy. `` She's 23 now. She's never held down a job, never kept an apartment for more than six months. She uses her boyfriends. She wants the finer things but she ca n't stand anybody else's dirt,'' <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> said in an interview published in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is n't alcohol or drugs _ at the rehab center her urine showed up negative. It's behavioral. She's very stubborn.'' Miss Cosby checked out of a drug rehabilitation center in September after acknowledging cocaine, marijuana and alcohol abuse. `` Looking back, I ca n't believe how dad managed to go on with his show every week, portraying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite father, while having a daughter like me causing so much pain,'' she was quoted as saying in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>'s Oct. 10th edition. Her dad, whose best seller `` Fatherhood'' is about raising his five children, has said that `` tough love'' _ letting <PERSON> Erinn </PERSON> work it out on her own _ was the only way to allow her to deal with her problems. `` It's going to take her hitting rock bottom, where she's totally exhausted and at that point where she ca n't fight anymore Right now we're estranged. She ca n't come here. She's not a person you can trust,'' <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> said. `` You think you're not a good parent because you do n't answer the call. But you ca n't let the kid use you.''

<HEAD>China Says Scowcroft Visit Will Help Improve Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media today heralded the visit of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and other leaders as saying the time had come to restore good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The surprise one-day visit by over the weekend effectively ended a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ban on high-level exchanges imposed after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> authorities sent in the military to crush the pro-democracy movement in June. Both sides expressed their hopes for a truce in recent U.S.-Chinese feuding, with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> saying good relations are crucial for world peace and security. However, no concrete measures to ease frictions between the two sides were announced. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> today carried two lengthy front-page stories on Scowcroft's meetings with Chinese leaders, including three separate pictures of the American emissary with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, and party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> Says Sino-U.S. Relations Should Finally Improve,'' one headline said. It noted that <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> spoke of the `` broad prospects'' for cooperation and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said both countries should `` do more practical work'' to improve relations. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s remarks were at variance with previous Chinese statements that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was entirely at fault for strained ties and must take the initiative in normalizing relations. However, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said it `` remains to be seen'' whether the good intentions expressed by both sides will result in any substantive progress in resolving conflicts. Those include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s human rights record and the issue of astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the pro-democracy dissident who has been hiding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, since June and who is wanted by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police as a `` counterrevolutionary.'' There is also speculation that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will retaliate against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measures to extend the visas of Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by halting widely popular student exchange programs. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> defended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to send the delegation six months after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began its crackdown by driving protesters from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military attack. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' program, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` The president ... deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen Square. But he's of the view that we should n't run the risk of compounding that tragedy by trying to isolate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from the international community.'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was among congressional critics of the trip.

Scowcroft, accompanied by Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, also briefed the Chinese on the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit and other international issues before leaving Sunday for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where they briefed Chinese leaders on the visit.

<HEAD>Gov't Devalues Currency By More Than Half, Raises Fuel Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an effort to cool an overheated economy, the government has cut the value of the currency by more than half and ordered sharp fuel price increases. The Economy Ministry, in a communique issued minutes before midnight Sunday, said it was making `` corrections'' in the economic policy followed by the government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menen </PERSON> since his July 8 inauguration. All banks and currency exchange houses were ordered closed today so the economic adjustments could be made more smoothly. The corrections were required, the ministry said, `` to combat disturbances experienced in the exchange market in recent weeks.'' The Ministry said it would devalue the austral by 53.4 percent _ setting the official value of the national currency at 1,000 to one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, compared to the 650-1 official rate in effect since July 10. The official exchange market will be used for sale and purchase of dollars in export-import and financial operations, the ministry said. At the same time, the ministry said, it will permit the operation of a `` free'' exchange market for all other dollar transactions on which the value of the austral will be allowed to float. An illegal although widely tolerated black market previously had operated in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and a widening gap between the official and black market values of the dollar had provoked concern in recent weeks. On Thursday, the dollar sold for 1,020 australs on the black market, compared to the official value of 655. The ministry also announced that the price of regular gasoline would rise by 61 percent to the equivalent of $ 1.44 per gallon. Economy Minister <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> said new rates for public utilities, such as telephones, natural gas and electricity, would be announced today. Current public service rates were set July 9 when they were increased by 200 percent, and were to have remained frozen for all of 1990. The communique, issued after <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> met for three hours with his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, also announced a $ 30 monthly pay increase for public employes and a $ 24 raise for the private sector. The communique said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will cease to provide aid in financing deficits of state companies and provincial governments. The government has moved cautiously on the issue of modifying current economic policy. A devaluation was considered likely to fuel price increases, wage demands and inflation. Also, higher utility bills and transport fares might erode public support for the 5-month-old government. The cost of living, which soared to nearly 200 percent in July, had dropped by 5.6 percent in October, but rose by 6.5 percent in November. Independent economists predicted the December rate could be in double digits.

<TEXT>
 In a move that could further delay the first Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is asking stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will not be involved, officials said today. Israeli wants the new assurances before Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> agrees to attend a preliminary meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> expected to work out a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to the first direct talks with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives, officials said. In the occupied lands, meanwhile, soldiers today shot and wounded seven Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The confrontations were touched off by the fatal shootings of two Palestinians Sunday, apparently by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians who opened fire after attacks on their vehicles by stone-throwers, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. A total of 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the 2-year-old uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 155 other Palestinians have been killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as alleged collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty-three Israelis also have died. The army also said troops on Sunday night demolished the homes of three suspects in the slaying of an alleged Palestinian collaborator with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In comments on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said he still was suspicious that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was indirectly representing the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` If this is what will be, I fear that we wo n't get very far,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> had planned a trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month for a meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. Asked about the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> trip today, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said, `` Firstly, I'm not going yet. We will first conduct contacts concerning the guarantees that our Cabinet has asked.'' <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Eliakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later this week to discuss the promise sought by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees against any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> role last month in its acceptance of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting. The latest possible obstacle to talks followed weekend news reports that secret contacts already were under way among Israeli, Egyptian, American and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> officials to draw up a list of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators. A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON>, was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> daily today as saying the organization had been asked to draw up three lists of names for presentation to the Israelis. On Sunday, the newspaper listed some of the Palestinians under consideration as east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, journalist and union leader <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON>, newspaper editor <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>, a school principle in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> confirmed the reported behind-the-scenes contacts to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and said he was heading to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for talks on the subject. But <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied the report, saying the contacts had not reached the stage of putting together a list of negotiators.

<HEAD>Communists Expected To Lose in Local Elections in Baltics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Estonians and Latvians took part in the first major contested local elections in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and Communists were expected to lose many of the city and regional council seats in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics. <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> officials said first results would not be released until Wednesday, and an election official in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> said results there might be available Friday, while Latvians said it would be Wednesday or later before they had results. There were 33,500 candidates running for the councils. Sunday's elections were critical for local reforms because it is the vast numbers of local and regional bureaucrats who are blamed for blocking Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s programs The Baltic elections are the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first major contested elections at the local level. Other republics will have their local elections later. Polls indicated environmentalists were likely to garner half the vote in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> did a pre-election poll showing the Communists would receive less than 10 percent of the vote with 100 percent turnout. However, they could fare even worse, since many ethnic Russians are boycotting the elections to protest a two-year residency requirement for candidates. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, Communist candidates want to see <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> gain autonomy but remain in a reformed Soviet federation, while the grass-roots <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> movement stands for outright independence and secession, according to the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The Popular Front in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> will be thrilled if it wins half the races, because Latvians are little more than 30 percent of the population, said <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumins </PERSON>, deputy editor of <LOCATION> Atmoda </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Hundreds of thousands of Russians and other non-Latvians have moved into the republic in the nearly 50 years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power, and they are divided on the independence issue. The elections are the first in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to include candidates from de facto alternative political parties, including environmentalists, a group of farmers seeking the right to own land and an organization protecting the rights of immigrants. Political parties other than the Communists have been legalized only in the neighboring <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> _ and only last week. A new national Parliament was chosen in the nation's first contested elections in the spring, but 80 percent of the candidates were <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and the rest were independent.

 The infant who received the nation's first living-donor liver transplant underwent an operation to stop bleeding on the surface of the liver, a condition doctors called common and controllable. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition today at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, after the second operation in two days to stop bleeding on the surface of her new organ, which she received two weeks ago. `` The surgeon said the liver looked fine,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the medical center. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, 22 months, was in surgery for about four hours Sunday. The bleeding was controlled, said Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, who led the transplant and the later operations. Doctors first detected the bleeding Saturday afternoon when they noticed the child's abdomen had swelled, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON>. She called the problem a minor setback. `` It's a common problem'' that happens in 30 percent of all liver-transplant patients, Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. `` You just never know when it's going to happen, but it's something that's controllable and something you can manage.'' The problem is the same one that prompted doctors to operate on <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> within 12 hours after she received part of her mother's liver on Nov. 27 The girl is the daughter of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. The 29-year-old mother was released from the hospital Thursday, and has been back to visit several times, Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, doctors were optimistic that 15-month-old <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the nation's second living-donor liver tranplant recipient, would recover from her 7 -LCB- - hour surgery performed Friday `` She's doing better than expected,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. `` Her liver functions look good so far and she's very alert.'' <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> was expected to remain in critical but stable condition for the next few days as doctors watch for signs of rejection of the new organ or the bacterial infection that delayed the surgery, doctors said. Her condition was unchanged this morning. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 20, from the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, area, donated the left lobe of his liver to his daughter. He was moved out of the intensive care unit Sunday morning and was listed in serious but stable condition, Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said.

 Authorities in the southern steel town of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> have quietly removed a statue of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> that youthful demonstrators have repeatedly defaced and tried to destroy. The removal was ordered Friday after demonstrations the past two Wednesdays in which youths who threw paint and flammable liquids on the monument clashed with police, who used water cannon and tear gas to disperse them. The state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the 30-foot statue was emoved from its plinth and `` in perfect condition transported to the locality of Wroblowice ... For necessary conservation works.'' Its future will be be decided by the municipal and district councils, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said, but it is unlikely that anyone in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> will want it back. The monument to the founder of the Soviet state, placed on a central square, had been the centerpiece of the city built around a huge steel mill outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in the 1950s as a model socialist community. For residents of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, a Solidarity stronghold, it has long been a despised symbol of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s past forced dependence on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The attacks by the youthful demonstrators had created a delicate problem for the non-Communist government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Taduesz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The Solidarity-led government is trying to maintain good relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and said it would not tolerate more violence. Mediators had called on the local government to move quickly to remove the monument. The statue has suffered several ignoble attacks over the years. In 1979 it was dynamited by activists and had to be rebuilt by Communist authorities. A spokesman for Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said the `` acts of vandalism ... met with his highest condemnation.'' `` He believes these acts are manifestations of exceptional rampant fury. They do harm to the good name of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> worldwide, not only to the good relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Wlodzimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Losinski </PERSON>. The cultural commission of the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> city council on Saturday also closed the city's <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> and another cultural institution bearing his name, the pro-Solidarity <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today.

 An alleged key member of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel was extradited from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> despite escalating anti-extradition terrorism, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has revealed. Uruguayan national police turned <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> over to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at a naval base under heavy guard Friday and he was flown to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that night, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, assistant agent in charge of criminal investigations and organized crime activities in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He's very close to the top,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON>, an Argentine, was under tight security but refused to disclose his location more specifically than the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> metropolitan area. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was scheduled to appear before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> today. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON>, 39, accused of laundering more than $ 1 billion for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cartel and a target of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> money-laundering probe code-named `` Polar Cap,'' had been held in an Uruguayan jail since February. His extradition, however, occurred just two days after a devastating terrorist bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers killed dozens and wounded hundreds outside <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s police intelligence headquarters. A group of drug lords calling themselves `` the extraditables'' has been waging a terror campaign of bombings and assassinations to force the government to end its war on the cartel and forestall extraditions. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was a `` badly wanted'' fugitive and his extradition `` marks yet another turning point in the willingness of the international community, particularly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to work with us in bringing to an end the tyranny and impunity of these drug empires.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment of <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> and 30 others was handed up in February. It charged them with `` carrying out the largest Colombian drug cartel money laundering operation ever uncovered by American law enforcement authorities,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> is accused of personally controlling the flow of more than $ 1 billion in drug money, he said. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> has said he is a legal trader in gold. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, with some of the most liberal banking laws in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, allows both citizens and foreigners to enter and leave the country with gold and freely transfer capital in and out. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON>' transfer to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> custody was conducted under a blanket of police protection in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on Friday. He was led handcuffed from a jail cell in <LOCATION> Maldonado </LOCATION>, 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, local radio stations reported. Police sharpshooters stood guard atop buildings while <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was put in a helicopter for a short ride to the Captain <PERSON> Curbelo </PERSON> navy base. Access to the base was blocked off and its perimeter was patrolled by other helicopters. A dozen <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents took custody of <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> on board a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane.

 Few Soviets walked off the job today despite a call by human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for a two-hour general strike to demand an end to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> domination, according to reports reaching <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, also facing pressure from hard-line Communists, angrily offered to resign as party leader after criticism of his overtures to the West, said a member of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and several other parliamentarians on Sunday urged the national strike to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to vote on rescinding Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which guarantees the Communists the `` leading and guiding role'' in society. They also want the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which opens Tuesday, to act on several key reform laws. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s group failed to win the support of 400 progressive parliamentarians. The <ORGANIZATION> InterRegional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> voted Sunday to favor the goal of rescinding Communist supremacy but did not back the strike. Members said the public mood was too explosive. Strikes have ravaged the struggling Soviet economy since last summer. Consumers are angry over shortages of food and consumer goods, and officials now warn that city-supplied steam heat could be affected by a coal strike in the depths of an already bitter Russian winter. On the streets of the capital today it was business as usual. Stores and transport operated and no pickets were in evidence. However, 214 of the 500 researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>' geography institute in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stopped their scientific studies for two hours, said <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Koslovsky </PERSON>, an interpreter for the institute They spent the time writing a resolution supporting the deputies' call for a vote on Article 6 and critical economic reforms, then sent the text to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> before returning to work In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, some store clerks and transport workers heeded the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s call to show solidarity with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s call through a work stoppage of 15 minutes, said <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> <PERSON> Melans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atmoda </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is facing unprecedented challenges to its monopoly on power. The Lithuanian legislature voted last week to eliminate the party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy in that republic. Estonians and Latvians voted for new city and regional council members in elections viewed as a referendum on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the independence of the two republics from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Communist officials faced overwhelming defeat. All three Baltic republics were annexed by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in 1940. The elections Sunday were the first in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to include candidates from de facto alternative political parties. First results were not expected until later today at the earliest. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, 5,000 people marched in sub-zero temperatures in support of reformist lawmakers. Police did not stop that protest, but they pushed several hundred others off <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> after speakers ripped up photographs of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. Demonstrators chanted, `` Freedom! Freedom!'' as the helmeted riot police punched, shoved and kicked them. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 20 people were detained. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, an unorthodox member of the 250-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told fellow reformers that Saturday's committee meeting was dominated by conservatives complaining about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s changes A conservative <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to resign after <PERSON> Kemerevo </PERSON> party chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> `` really let himself get carried away and said something like this: ` Is it proper to go bowing to the capitalists, to go asking a blessing from the Pope?''' The source, who attended the meeting, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was irked by the criticism of his moves to make peace with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and offered to step down if the full committee agreed with <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>. Other members immediately voiced support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> apologized, the source said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned that the situation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` unbelievably crucial,'' according to the transcript of his speech carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Soviet people do not want to put up with the fact that at a time when the normal rhythm of life has been broken, their local and national leaders are often doing nothing,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was willing to accept a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional guarantee of supremacy, but not immediately, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. He said it should come only as part of sweeping constitutional reforms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cited the nation's serious economic troubles in arguing that the second session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which begins Tuesday, must concentrate on economic reforms and not veer off into a discussion of constitutional issues

 Operation Rescue leaders say they will bring their anti-abortion activities back to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> starting Friday, including picketing at clinics and the homes of those perceived as backers of legal abortions. Thousands of the group's followers have been arrested in demonstrations across the country since Operation Rescue rose to prominence in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with demonstrations during the 1988 Democratic National Convention. `` We are going to have rescues and they are going to be reinforced,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> director of Operation Rescue. `` It's going to be a concerted effort from a number of different directions.'' Crowd control has been taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th Precinct and given to the Special Operations division. Division chief Maj. <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said officers will be taken from other details such as robbery stakeouts to keep order. `` We will give them a reasonable time to disperse from the property and if they refuse they will be subject to arrest,'' he said. <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said the behavior of the demonstrators will determine whether controversial, painful `` come-along'' holds are used in making arrests. Police were criticized for overuse of the tactics in some previous demonstrations. Pro-choice groups say they will hold counterdemonstrations wherever Operation Rescue appears. Operation Rescue's national director, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, is serving a two-year term in a state prison north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for his part in past demonstrations. He chose the jail term over a fine and banishment from the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, today welcomed <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s non-violent revolution and hoped for the day when his homeland of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> would celebrate its own triumph over <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> occupation. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today lodged a protest with <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> over Sunday's presentation of the award to the Tibetan spiritual leader and said the official <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> participation would `` greatly impair'' relations In a separate ceremony in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, on Sunday, King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> awarded gold Nobel medallions to nine laureates who won the prizes for literature, chemistry, physics, medicine and economic sciences. Six were Americans. In keeping with tradition, the peace prize winner gives a lecture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olso </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said in a text prepared for today's lecture that `` the awarding of the Nobel Prize to me, a simple monk from far-away <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, here in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, also fills us Tibetans with hope.'' The exiled leader then said he wanted to speak about human understanding, compassion and love `` instead of reading my speech.'' His one-hour impromptu talk concentrated on moral and ethical questions illustrated with homilies that often provoked laughter from the audience of 600. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said he will use the $ 469,000 peace prize to help starving people, lepers in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, various peace programs and to establish the Tibetan Foundation for Universal Responsibility. At Sunday's ceremony attended by Norwegian King Olav V and other government officials, he said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rejection of his 1987 peace plan was forcing him to rethink his approach and that he might withdraw his proposal. But, he added: `` Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred.'' `` I accept the prize with profound gratitude on behalf of the oppressed everywhere and for all those who struggle for freedom and work for world peace,'' he said. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, 54, was chosen at age 5 as the reincarnation of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s god-king, making him religious and political head of the isolated mountain nation. He fled into exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after a failed uprising in 1959. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> for 40 years. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> has called for Tibetan autonomy over domestic matters, with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> retaining control over military and diplomatic affairs. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has rejected the formula. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said the Chinese had `` become even more repressive'' since the announcement in October that he was receiving the peace prize. He said several Tibetans were sentenced to up to 19 years in prison last week, `` possibly ... to intimidate the population before today's event.'' `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can not escape the impact of this spirit of freedom sweeping many parts of the world,'' he said, citing the political changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an unidentified official of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lodged a protest in a meeting with <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tore </PERSON> <PERSON> Holvik </PERSON>. The official said the presence of Norwegian leaders at the award ceremony `` constituted an open support to the Dalai clique's activities aimed at splitting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and a gross interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> was the 70th recipient since the first peace prizes were awarded in 1901 from the estate of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the Swedish inventor of dynamite. Spanish writer <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON> received the prize for literature. Americans <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> won the Nobel Prize for medicine; Americans <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for physics; Americans <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> for chemistry, and <PERSON> Trygve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> for economics.

 A teacher who was forced from his job after refusing to wear a necktie returned to the classroom today after tying his adversaries in legal knots. He wore a flannel shirt and jeans _ no tie. One year ago this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> fired <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> for refusing to conform to a new dress code. Today, he returned to the classroom at <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> with the power of a judge's recent order. Principal <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> refused to let reporters into the school building this morning, saying, `` We're going to have a normal school day.'' Assistant Principal <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 46, showed up for work wearing flannel and denim. `` I'm a little bit apprehensive, I guess,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said Sunday night. `` When I left there, it was under strange circumstances. It's going to be a little strange going in.'' Students who gathered outside a fast food restaurant near school began said today that <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s return was not a major event. `` I like him. He's all right,'' said senior <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, adding that there was little discussion about <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who has been teaching math at Point Pleasant for 21 years, contends that the school board does n't have a right to tell him what to wear. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> _ and <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> _ say the dress code is unconstitutional. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said the code should n't apply to him anyway because it was put into effect after he had signed his contract for the 1988-89 school year. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> school board officials have n't given up on overturning <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>'s ruling, but they have consented to allow <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> to return to work while the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> considers their appeal. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who gave up wearing more formal attire shortly after he started teaching, said he will continue wearing denim shirts, work boots and jeans to the classroom. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who also farms part time, chose that style of dress shortly after he came to Point Pleasant, saying that dress clothes hampered his ability to communicate with students. `` There's so many things in my life that I do enjoy, but the one thing I really enjoy is the interaction with the kids,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> woman battling her state's mandatory seatbelt law lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The justices, without comment, refused to hear <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s arguments that the law, similar to those in most states, violates her constitutional rights. Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION> housewife, was ticketed April 26, 1988 for not wearing a seatbelt while teaching her daughter how to drive the family car. The violation carries a $ 10 fine. With court costs, Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> faced paying $ 21.50. Challenging her jury-trial conviction through the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> courts and to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has cost her `` about $ 1,000 so far,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview. `` Lots of people said, ` Why do n't you just pay the $ 21.50,' but it's the principle of the thing.'' The last bill Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> received _ she has yet to pay the fine or any court costs _ was for $ 66.50. Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> acted as her own lawyer throughout the unsuccessful court fight. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in another case that the state law is constitutional, and spent just two paragraphs in upholding Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s conviction last Sept. 18. In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, `` This case provides the court with an opportunity to delineate the boundaries of state action as regards inalienable rights of the individual citizens.'' Arguing that the safety of wearing seatbelts is questionable, Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s appeal said, `` When state regulation causes injury and death by an unproven speculative measure of safety, a justiciable controversy exists.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> she believes her right to travel and her right to be free from unnecessary government regulation is violated by the seatbelt law. `` In a free country, they ca n't do that,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said she has no doubt the time and money invested in her court case was well spent. Quoting from a 1950 dissenting opinion by the late <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said: `` It is not the function of our government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error.'' The case is <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 89-687.

<HEAD>Nevada Casino Owner Loses Appeal in Bank Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by a former gambling casino owner convicted of bank fraud and ordered to pay $ 7.5 million in restitution. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling against businessman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON> stemming from the 1985 sale of his hotel-casino complex in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> area on the <LOCATION> California-Nevada </LOCATION> border. Cloud purchased the complex, the <ORGANIZATION> Cal-Neva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 10 million in 1980 and decided to sell it a few years later because of mounting operating losses. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Perroton </PERSON> agreed to buy the complex for $ 17 million. But <PERSON> Perroton </PERSON> got a $ 20 million loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Hibernia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to finance the purchase after misrepresenting the sale price as $ 27.5 million. <PERSON> Perroton </PERSON> pleaded guilty to bank fraud and other charges, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Cloud was convicted by a federal jury of aiding and abetting bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. He was placed on probation for five years, fined $ 500,000 and ordered to pay $ 7.5 million to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to reimburse it for some of the money it paid to the <ORGANIZATION> Hibernia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Cloud said he went along innocently with the phony loan amount on assurances from <LOCATION> Perroton </LOCATION> that there was nothing wrong with it. Cloud said he never intended to defraud the bank and was a victim of <PERSON> Perroton </PERSON>'s scheme. Cloud also said he should not be forced to pay the insurance company $ 7.5 million because he previously reached a settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Hibernia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to repay it $ 1.5 million. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected his appeal last April. The appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to convict Cloud, and a federal judge who ordered the restitution acted under proper authority granted by the federal Victim and Witness Protection Act. The case is Cloud vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-455.

<TEXT>
 Sirens wailed, horns honked and bells pealed at noon today in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and other cities to mark a dramatic opposition victory that ended the Communists' 41-year domination of the government. Also today, army units began pulling down the Iron Curtain border with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> radio reported that Pacem Im <PERSON> Terris </PERSON>, the state-controlled organization of <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clergy, will shut down. The organization was viewed by indepedendent priests and bishops as a tool of the Communists, and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> declared it illegal several years ago. Several ranking figures in Pacem im <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION> were dismissed last week after being accused of cooperating with the secret police. On Sunday, in his last act as president, <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> swore in a Cabinet whose members include people he had jailed or stripped of all but the most menial jobs. The new Cabinet gave the country its first government dominated by non-Communists since 1948. Today's three-minute demonstration took the place of a general strike called off Sunday by opposition leaders after their historic success in overturning Communist domination of the government. Around <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square, the site of huge pro-democracy protests the last three weeks, thousands of Christmas shoppers and workers on lunch break joined in the three-minute demonstration of support, ringing tiny bells or shaking sets of keys. On nearby <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the deep gong of the bells from <ORGANIZATION> Tyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> echoed off the ancient buildings. Above a large Christmas tree, young people leaned out of a third-floor window as the bells and sirens sounded. `` This is the end of communism,'' said <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Navara </PERSON>, a 27-year-old actress, ringing a brass chime in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today: _ The four World War II Allies _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ met in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the first time since 1971. The Soviets expressed `` favorable interest'' in a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> plan to boost the international role of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to a joint statement. _ <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened a session to discuss the situation in the country one day after tens of thousands demonstrated for reform and curbs on party power. _ Most Soviets ignored a call by human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for a two-hour general strike to demand an end to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> domination, according to reports reaching <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. _ The leadership of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s second-largest state, <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, for the first time called for the establishment of a multiparty system in the Communist country. Czechoslovak army units began pulling down barbed wire fencing along a 20-mile stretch of its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. After the first stretch of the frence was cut away and rolled up, officials from both countries met on the open border near the Austrian town of <LOCATION> Wullowitz </LOCATION> to shake hands. The radio said some Communist Party cells at state enterprises charged with indoctrination and other political work had disbanded, although not formally required to do so. In <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, opposition leaders said today's noontime demonstration was to show support for opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who is considered a favorite to succeed <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. Posters plastered throughout central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> showed a smiling <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> with the caption, `` <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> to the Castle,'' a reference to the seat of the presidency. On Sunday, the 53-year-old playwright told a cheering crowd of 100,000 in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> that the new government was `` a great success.'' `` This peaceful revolution was ... against violence, dirt, mafias, privileges, persecutions,'' the once-banned playwright said in the nationally televised speech. `` Let us preserve its purity, peacefulness, love and merry, friendly flair.'' The new `` government of national understanding'' contains 10 Communists, two of whom enjoy opposition support, seven non-party members and two members each from the small <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> and People's parties, which recently broke with the Communists It includes two men who just weeks ago were persecuted as dissidents. In a key compromise, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the nation's hated secret and uniformed police, will be run jointly by a former dissident, the new Communist premier and a Communist Party member proposed by the opposition. The new government was sworn in by <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, 76, the man responsible for the 21 years of repression after a Soviet-led invasion crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who presided over the jailing and firing of hundreds of thousands of people as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, then resigned. In addition to <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, ` Prague Spring' reform leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> has been named as a candidate for president, to be chosen by Parliament this month. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 68, had been replaced as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief by <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. The new Czechoslovak government marks a triumph of the persecuted over their persecutors. The new foreign minister, <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, was jailed with <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> from 1979 to 1982 for battling for human rights. A new first deputy premier, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, is a Slovak lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist freed from jail just two weeks ago. Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON>, a Communist, remained defense minister, but the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will be run by the new premier, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>; First Vice Premier <PERSON> Valtr </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member proposed by the opposition; and <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> will oversee the secret police, who once hounded him. Parliament, which meets Tuesday, has two weeks to choose a new president. The opposition coalition Civic Forum and its Slovak counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, were formed Nov. 19 _ two days after riot police brutally beat peaceful demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Czechs and Slovaks were taking to the streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand a government of their choosing. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has since lost its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and all its hard-line leaders have been removed. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the students who started the mass movement for democracy decided Sunday night to continue their nationwide three-week sit-in strike. CTK gave no reasons for the decision. The new government is supposed to lay down the legal basis for democracy and pave the way for free elections.

 The embattled president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills-Hollywood </PERSON> chapter has resigned, just days before the national organization begins an investigation into allegations he mismanaged the chapter <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> announced his resignation during the taping of the Image Awards ceremony honoring blacks in the entertainment industry and to be aired next month on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` Two years ago I vowed that if the Image Awards would successfully be on television for four years and if the Beverly Hills-Hollywood <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> developed a strong bond with the industry, my job was done,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said Saturday night during the taping at the Wiltern Theater. But his resignation comes several days before an inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> into allegations <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> mismanaged the chapter. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was criticized for accepting $ 25,000 for helping produce last year's Image Awards show. He has also drawn fire from some chapter members for what they claim is his lack of aggressiveness in pursuing civil rights issues and alleged mismanagement of chapter funds. `` We're glad he resigned,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, leader of the chapter's dissidents, on Sunday. Ms. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> was one of several protesters who picketed outside the Wiltern on Saturday night, waving placards that accused <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> with statements such as: `` What Have You Done For Civil Rights Lately?'' After his statement Saturday, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> would only say, `` I resigned because I wanted to resign.'' An <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> national panel scheduled a Dec. 19 hearing in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> on the mismanagement allegations. Last September, chapter members voted for <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' resignation after he accepted the $ 25,000 for his work on the 1988 Image Awards show. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. `` There has been lots of turmoil. We've got some bridges to mend,'' said the new chapter president, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers-Manly </PERSON>, who will remain at the post until elections are held in 1990.

 The Communists' policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met today following the nation's largest pro-democracy rally in which tens of thousands of people demanded that party leaders share power. Also today, the municipal court in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> approved the registration application of Ecoglasnost, making the environmental organization <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s first legal independent political group. Party leader <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> opened the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session with a speech on `` the situation in the country, the party and the immediate tasks,'' the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. The dispatch gave no further details. About 5,000 people held a silent vigil in 14-degree temperatures earlier in the day outside party headquarters to show the Communist leadership the people were watching its work, according to organizers. On Sunday, more than 50,000 people chanted `` Democracy!'' and applauded demands for the Communist leadership to quit. It was the biggest rally of its kind since <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement began less than a month ago and since the party consolidated power 43 years ago. Many people held candles in the bright sunshine at today's vigil, and a white, red and green Bulgarian flag waved on a platform set up behind the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building Police set up barriers to keep the gathering from disrupting morning traffic, and a few officers stood at a distance around the crowd. After one hour, the crowd dispersed quietly. Organizers said similar vigils would be held later today and on Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting was expected to last at least two days and focus on growing grass-roots demands for the kind of democratic reforms that have swept <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also met Friday in a session that was not announced, and 22 people were removed from the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and four from the ruling Politburo. If the Committee were to resign, a new one would have to be elected at a party congress. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Rabotnichesko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delo </ORGANIZATION> today carried a guest commentary in which the author urged an extraordinary congress to be held as soon as posible and suggested the end of February as a possible date. The paper said it had received more than 4,000 letters and telephone calls from people demanding reforms since Nov. 10, when <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for 35 years. A poll conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> polling group indicated that only 23 percent of those questioned had a lot of trust in the party, the newspaper reported. It said 1,513 people from 127 work collectives were questioned in the poll, conducted Nov. 28. The newspaper said only 32 percent showed general trust in any political organizations. It concluded that the Communists had `` discredited themselves in the eyes of the people,'' while opposition groups had not had a chance to test their political ability. Sunday's rally was organized by 19 independent groups that drafted a resolution urging talks between the Communists and the groups. Protesters waved their hands in the air to show approval of the resolution, which recognized moves toward liberalization since <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was ousted. But it complained that reform was too slow in coming. Popular pressure for the party to give up its constitutionally guaranteed leading role has been growing, and the crowd repeatedly cheered that demand. Last week, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he foresaw changes in the constitution and indicated the party's leading role was an open question The municipal court in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> has previously rejected Ecoglasnost's application for legal status as an independent political group. It changed its mind three days before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is to meet to discuss issues including a proposed law on associations. Ecoglasnost has played a key role in mobilizing people to press for reforms. It also a member of the newly formed umbrella <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises the 10 most influential independent groups. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Slabokov </PERSON>, a well-known actor and the president of Ecoglasnost, said one of the group's first projects will be to determine whether the general health of people has been damaged by air and river pollution.

 In a decision narrowing the reach of the Freedom of Information Act, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today shielded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from having to give <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> documents received from another government agency. By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheld because they were `` compiled for law enforcement purposes'' _ and therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy. Grumman and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> exchanged letters in 1978. In the exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> agency questioned certain accounting practices <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> used for defense contracts. Grumman defended its practices, and no government action was taken. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began a criminal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, and the exchange of letters was sent from the audit agency to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Grumman filed an FOIA lawsuit in 1987 seeking `` all documents that are related in any way to the subject of the -LRB- 1978 -RRB- correspondence.'' A federal judge ruled against the contractor, saying release of the documents would jeopardize a grand jury investigation.

 An off-duty police officer and a 26-year-old woman were shot to death in the second slaying of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> police officer in two days, authorities said. Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendell </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> were killed Sunday night at the woman's apartment, officials said. <PERSON> Mendell </PERSON> was a 17-year veteran of the force. Police believe the shooting resulted from a domestic dispute involving a man who was the officer's roommate. The man had once dated Ms. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, police said. Shortly after the shootings, the roommate turned himself in to police in <LOCATION> Bellarie </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> suburb, in connection with the slayings, said police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Preece </PERSON>. His name was not immediately released.

<TEXT>
 An opposition campaign rally turned into a riot in which one person was killed and more than 20 people injured. Foreign observers blamed the violence on Sandinista provocateurs. Sunday's violence lasted four hours and was the worst of the campaign leading to general elections set for Feb. 25. Foreigners said the clashes raised doubts the balloting would be held without incident. Opponents and supporters of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> fought with machetes, knives, broken bottles, rocks and sticks in this town 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The local <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> headquarters was sacked, and two vehicles were burned. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, 38, of the nearby village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION> was stabbed to death. Reports in pro-government newspapers today quoted his mother, <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, and an unidentified relative as blaming supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I came here assuming that there would be free and open elections,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a bipartisan group invited to observe the electoral process. `` You ca n't witness what we saw today and believe there's any way there'll be a fair election in this country. The opposition has accused Sandinista gangs of disrupting earlier opposition rallies. Sunday's fighting broke out during a rally organized by the <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> when a group of about 20 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> loyalists and opposition followers exchanged insults and then blows in this town of 15,000 people. <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> and an opposition organizer, <PERSON> Jeremias </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON>, said a series of provocations by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> supporters sparked the riot. `` It's very clear to me that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- supporters were constantly probing the perimeter of this rally looking to disrupt it,'' said <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who managed <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mondale </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 presidential campaign. `` It was too clear: they showed up at specific times and the police disappeared.'' Lt. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Masatepe </PERSON> police chief, said he had been ordered to keep police away from the rally. He said he did not want to give opponents of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` a pretext for them to say that we were there to repress them.'' Witnesses said at least 20 people were injured. They said <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> activists threw rocks during an opposition march, reappeared to trade insults with the crowd while candidates were delivering speeches and withdrew after being admonished by observers from the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Sandinista militants appeared again after the event had ended and the opposition crowd, estimated at about 2,000, was dispersing. People were slashed with machetes, knives and broken bottles; rocks were thrown and people hit with sticks. <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said he was pushed to the ground as opposition and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> supporters threw stones at each other. He said rescued a girl about 5 years old who apparently became separated from her mother. `` The girl ... was getting trampled so I pulled her out from underneath it,'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said. `` The machetes came out and we were four feet from the fighting.'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> was hit on the back of the head and hurt slightly. He said he and the little girl crawled away, then ran. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerda </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee, said he and 12 other people had taken refuge in the party headquarters when he saw about 200 people approach. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said he heard the crowd shout that they were coming to kill everyone inside. He and the others escaped through the back of the building. The building was heavily damaged and the furniture inside burned. A home next door also was sacked, and a jeep and a motorcycle set ablaze. On Dec. 3, a group of Sandinista supporters attacked a house being inaugrated as the local opposition coalition headquarters in <LOCATION> Cofradias </LOCATION>, a village 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Dozens of people were injured in a rock-throwing melee. Presdent <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> moved up the general elections by a year as part of an agreement by Central American to end regional insurgencies. The U.S.-backed Contra rebels have fought the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> since 1981 and are based in neighborning <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Under the Aug. 7 agreement, they were to have been disbanded last week. But the Contras remain intact and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he wants them to remain a viable force to ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> hold clean elections.

<HEAD>Iran Said Advising Friends In Lebanon To Release Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOHA, Qatar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been advising its `` friends'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release their Western hostages, a senior Iranian official was quoted as saying in a newspaper interview published today in this <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nation. `` We have directed our advice to our friends in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to cease their acts with respect to the kidnapping of the Western hostages,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Raya </ORGANIZATION> quoted Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> as saying. `` But the problem is that every time the atmosphere becomes propitious for the release of the hostages, there are counter-incidents that cloud the atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, who was on a two-day visit that ended Sunday. The paper said he was specifically referring to the kidnapping by Israeli commandos of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem preacher from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, on July 28. On July 31, Shiite Moslem kidnappers of the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said they killed their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation for the kidnapping. Most of the 18 Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed to be in the hands of Iranian-backed Shiite groups. They are eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and the election of the more pragmatic President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> gave rise to some hopes of Iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives.

<HEAD>Report: NY State National Guard Sapped By No-Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No-show or consistently <ORGANIZATION> AWOL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> soldiers have inflated federal funding to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and given officials the false impression that the force is combat-ready, a newspaper reported today. Between 1,600 and 4,000 National Guard soldiers in the state are absent without leave and should be dismissed, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. No-shows are not paid, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sets minimum manpower requirements and provides funds for equipment and training based on those numbers. The newspaper said its investigation concluded that the phantom force was created in 1984 by <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state guard from 1975 to 1986 who became ensnared in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> was released from prison in July after serving one year for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the defunct defense contractor. <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> could not be reached today for comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report. Calls this morning to a telephone listed in his name in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb went unanswered. Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, the state Guard's personnel director, said `` probably'' about 1,600 Guard members should be discharged for absenteeism. But reports indicated the figure may be much higher. Federal regulations say soldiers with nine unexcused absences must be dismissed. A congressional report said that in the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> training session, absenteeism was 32 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. And a confidential Guard report, a military personnel profile for its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> division, the 42nd, showed that 3,367 guardsmen have been absent from drills and training sessions at least nine times, the newspaper said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, commander of the state Guard, said he was keeping no-shows on the roster, despite the rules, in hopes they could be restored to active duty. It is cheaper than recruiting new soldiers, he said. He could not provide figures on how many absentee guardsmen had returned to duty. If the absentees are dismissed, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will have to classify <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as unprepared for combat, according to the report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> already has the second worst attendance records in the nation, but its budget has tripled since 1975 to $ 390 million, the newspaper said. The newspaper quoted an unidentified former top <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> aide as saying that <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> ordered absentee guardsmen kept on the roster.

<TEXT>
 The leadership of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s second-largest state today for the first time called for the establishment of a multiparty system in this Communist country Communists have been slow in realizing the `` historic exhaustion of the single-party system,'' <PERSON> Stanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON>, head of the Croatian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling presidium, said at the opening of a regional party congress in the Croatian capital of <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>. `` There can be no democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the right of association and competition of political -LRB- movements -RRB- and programs,'' <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON> said in his keynote speech carried by the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Until now the liberal northern state of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> was the only one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics to openly advocate the introduction of Western-style democracy. About a dozen independent movements and parties have been set up in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> over the past year, and the region plans to hold its first free legislative elections next March. On Sunday some 25,000 people in several Croatian cities signed a petition urging legalization of numerous parties that would make possible the holding of free elections in the republic bordering <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` We consider that -LRB- <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s new constitution -RRB- should provide for a political system that will include ... parties and movements representing the political interests of citizens,'' said <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON>, according to a report broadcast by <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> radio. <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and some other republics have in the past been non-committal about multiparty democracy, which is vehemently opposed by the Communist leadership of the country's largest state of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Earlier this month <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, in an apparent move to stifle burgeoning democratic trends in the country, severed all business and official ties with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. The unprecedented action shook the foundations of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s loose federal system. <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON> sharply denounced <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s break with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, describing the consequences as `` dramatic with a possibly catastrophic outcome.'' `` Ultimatums and the severance of economic relations, accusations and threats represent a direct attack on the constitutional order of the country and its economic and political integrity,'' <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s parliament met today to discuss <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s actions, which Slovenian president <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanovik </PERSON> said were a `` heavy blow to the Yugoslav federation.'' He said <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> was trying to `` eliminate all those who hold differing opinions and to produce a change of the constitutional order.'' `` The blockade of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, therefore, represents an act of aggression against <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>,'' he told lawmakers. <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>'s state leadership, which had earlier sought to remain on the sidelines of the dispute between <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, came out strongly last week in favor of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. Croats and Serbs are traditional arch-rivals in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s patchwork of nationalities, and an open clash between the two regions could seriously threaten the unity of this <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nation <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has for years been a socialist showcase despite its one-party system. But political, economic, social and ethnic problems have mushroomed since the death in 1980 of President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, whose charisma was seen as a major force in bounding together the divergent ethnic groups in the country.

 A state senator beat former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in Republican caucuses to stake an early claim to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> endorsement in next year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate race. By winning Saturday's caucuses, Sen. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> became the front-runner heading into the Republican's Jan. 13 state convention. <PERSON> Bagert </PERSON> won 383, or 70 percent, of the 544 delegates selected at 14 caucuses. At stake is which <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> will win the right to challenge Democratic incumbent <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who was elected as a state representative last year amid controversy because of his racial views, won 27 delegates. Secretary of State <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> won 25 delegates and 109 were uncommitted. However, the victory does not guarantee <PERSON> Bagert </PERSON> the nomination. An additional 656 delegates still must be chosen, and pledges of support made at party caucuses are not binding. <PERSON> Bagert </PERSON> said the caucus victory gave his candidacy `` a stamp of approval.'' Both <PERSON> Bagert </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> have said they'll drop out of the race if they do n't get the party nomination. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> has said he'll run even if he is n't endorsed. Formal endorsement against <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., also would mean Republican financial support _ money, party newsletters and volunteers However, in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s unique open primary system, anyone can register as a candidate, regardless of party, and be placed on the ballot. The primary is set for Oct. 6, 1990; if no one gets a majority, the two top finishers will advance to the November election. `` <PERSON> Bagert </PERSON> was by far the strongest candidate,'' said <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> director. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who said he does not expect the party's endorsement, blamed his weak showing on his late entry into the race. `` We've organized this thing for three days.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that federal judges may help plaintiffs in age discrimination suits try to find other possible victims and seek their participation in such suits. The justices, by a 7-2 vote, ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 1,200 employees at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> plants. The high court said judges in such `` class action'' suits may help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination, who may be unaware of the lawsuit, and solicit their participation. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, writing for the court, said judges have discretion to authorize such notices to potential plaintiffs. That `` serves the legitimate goal of avoiding a multiplicity of duplicative suits and setting cut-off dates to expedite disposition of the action,'' he said. But, he said, judges `` must be scrupulous to respect judicial neutrality'' and not give even the appearance that they are endorsing the suit. In other action, the court: _ Refused to reinstate former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that overturned <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s 1988 conviction, 90-day jail sentence and $ 30,000 fine. _ Shielded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from having to give <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> documents received from another government agency, narrowing the reach of the Freedom of Information Act. By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheld because they were `` compiled for law enforcement purposes'' and therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy. _ Turned away an appeal by an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> woman battling her state's mandatory seatbelt law The justices, without comment, refused to hear <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s arguments that the law, similar to those in most states, violates her constitutional rights. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> dissented in the age-discrimination case. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, writing for both, said nothing in the federal law against age bias authorizes judges `` to undertake the unheard-of role of midwifing'' lawsuits against employers. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roch </PERSON> dismissed some 1,200 workers on Feb. 4, 1985. A group of older workers, who called the day `` Black Monday'' for many veteran workers, said a disproportionately high number of laid-off workers were over 40 years old. The group filed a lawsuit, charging the company with violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The group's leaders then sought to contact all fired workers over 40 eligible to join the lawsuit. Some 400 fired employees agreed to join. But leaders of the court battle against the company said they believed there might be 200 additional fired workers who are members of the class allegedly victimized by age discrimination. The leaders sought to contact the missing workers by mail and notices posted at <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> plants. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> ordered the company to provide the names and addresses of all fired workers. And <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said once the missing workers are found, they may be sent an explanation of the suit and a form seeking their consent to join the court fight. The form said the judge authorized the mailing but took no position on the merits of the case. An increased number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big advantage for the workers because it spreads out court costs. In seeking workers to join the suit, the leaders of the court fight asked, but did not require, a $ 200 contribution to help defray the costs. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today upheld a ruling by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, 88-1203.

<HEAD>Woman Gives Away Thousands in Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A well-dressed woman has disappeared after bringing early Christmas cheer to surprised patrons of a motel bar by handing out $ 100, $ 50 and $ 20 bills. A woman who identified herself as <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said she was competing in a national `` treasure hunt'' against 40 or 50 other people that required her to give money away, according to a truck driver at the bar who asked that his name not be used. The woman checked into a motel on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s southwest side on Saturday, walked into the lounge and gave $ 100 bills to each of three flight attendants sitting at a table, witnesses said. `` Merry Christmas,'' said the white-haired woman, in her 50s. She pulled the cash from a brown paper lunch bag in her purse. When she ran out of $ 100 bills, she apologized and gave out $ 50s. When she ran out of those, she apologized and gave out $ 20 bills, witnesses said. `` It's like ` Miracle on 34th Street,''' said waitress <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, referring to a movie about a man who says he is the real <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. By one estimate she gave away $ 5,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. Police today could offer no further information on the episode. `` As far as I know, she went back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawrocki </PERSON>. The woman's identity was not immediately confirmed. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> telephone book has two full pages of Kellys, and those with the first initial `` J'' fill half a column, and that does not include suburbanites who might say they are from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> checked out of the motel early Sunday morning, though she left her car behind in the parking lot, said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Mascorro </PERSON>, a front desk clerk at the Carlton Midway Motor Inn. Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had said the car was n't working and that she would send a tow truck to get it. `` It was towed sometime during the night,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wierz </PERSON>, assistant manager of the motel, said today. `` She said she was going to arrange for that,'' added Ms. <PERSON> Wierz </PERSON>, who said she had no further information. Police were called when the woman was giving away money. An officer at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> police station, who would not give his name, said police took Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Bobby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A man there who identified himself as an evaluator there said Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was taken in and evaluated Saturday night. The man, who would not give his name, said the woman later left in the company of the police. He would not provide any other information. The woman's generosity caused quite a commotion. People tried politely to make Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s acquaintance. Waitresses called friends and flight attendants from the airport rushed back to tell co-workers. `` They were all coming up and playing stupid like they did n't know what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON>, 21, an employee of a neighboring rental car agency, adding that he gave Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> a kiss in return for $ 100

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met today with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and said he does not believe <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> are drifting apart over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity. `` I do n't think there are any fences that need mending ... We feel a special relation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and to the prime minister,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters outside Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 Downing Street office. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at the start of a weeklong <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> trip seeking allied unity amid the rapid political changes sweeping <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Also on the agenda is the sensitive issue of German reunification. From <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> tonight. He is scheduled to meet West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday and visit the Berlin Wall. A call by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting last week for an `` intensified effort'' by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to unify was interpreted by some analysts as a prod to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the most outspoken opponent of rapid European integration. `` I do n't really think there is a drifting apart,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said after meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` I think that there was some misunderstanding last week with respect to exactly what was meant,' he added, in apparent reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s integration call. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who flew overnight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, held his first official talks with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s new foreign secretary, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, who was appointed six weeks ago, before meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. His task is to assure them the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` special relationship'' with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is firm and to solicit their views on how the West should approach the volatile political upheavals in the East European landscape. There is support within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for an acceleration of the political union of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that might include a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has doubts even about the current pace. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s stop was added after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telephoned the prime minister to assure her the `` special relationship'' between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was intact <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and its other borders a month ago, permitting thousands of cheering Germans to cross freely to the West for the first time since 1961. Hundreds danced on the wall. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s visit is designed to be low-key in order not to provoke the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` He is not going to dance on the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall,'' said a senior administration official. The six-day trip initially was scheduled as an uneventful winter meeting later in the week with the foreign ministers of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the Western alliance. But political upheavals in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, following the sharp detour from orthodox communism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, is sending <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> into talks with Western partners in an atmosphere of uncertainty. They will discuss whether Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will continue to encourage change with unrest mounting in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the abolition of the Communist party's monopoly of power in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Managing economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the future of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as a military alliance while <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> tensions recede are also on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s agenda in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. There is also the overriding issue of German reunification and a sharp warning recently from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that a 10-point plan by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and praised by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was `` fraught with dangerous consequences.'' French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has cautioned <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> not to push for reunification with ast <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, saying it could upset the delicate balance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies also are anxious about the prospect of a reunited and mighty <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> even though they are not as outspoken as the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader. Their concerns are partly rooted in the devastation of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the hands of the Germans in World War II. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official acknowledged the <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> plan `` made a lot of people nervous,'' including Soviet, French and Polish leaders. `` This is especially so with what is going on in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will join President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a meeting with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> on Saturday. The West Europeans will want to know if reports that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> moved too fast on reunification are accurate. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has deferred most decisions on German reunification to the West Europeans. At the same time, the allies would not want to get out of step with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the touchy issue.

 A year-long scientific analysis of the photographs and notes brought back by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> establishes that the explorer reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909, just as he claimed, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said today. The study was undertaken by the <ORGANIZATION> Navigators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization that had asserted last February that there was room for scholarly doubt that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admiral reached his destination. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> sponsored <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s mission and has defended the explorer's integrity. The foundation said earlier that a page of calculations made by <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> offered no evidence one way or the other. That page had been cited by debunkers who claimed that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was off course and ended his quest for the pole 121 miles shy of his destination. But in its new report, the navigators' group said today that modern methods of analyzing at which position the sun stood when a photograph was taken helped establish the claim by <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> that he had gotten to the pole. `` Our analysis of the data <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> brought back from his journey _ his celestial sights, his diary, his ocean soundings and his photographs _ has convinced us that their final camp, named <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesup </PERSON>, was no more than five miles from the pole,'' the foundation said. To conduct its investigation, the foundation compared <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s measurements of ocean depths, known as soundings, with modern profiles of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> floor The foundation said this analysis also supported <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s account. The foundation based its report on a study of 225 cubic feet of papers on the Peary expedition as well as other documents. One of <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s most vocal detractors is <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>, an astronomer and historian who in 1988 concluded that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had lied about his location. `` Suggesting <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> might not have reached the pole is one thing; declaring him a fraud is another,'' said National Geographic President <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, in attacking <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>' conclusions.

<HEAD>Court Limits How Multinational Corporations Can Use Laws to Reduce
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today limited the way multinational corporations can use foreign tax laws to reduce their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes, a ruling the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said may save the government hundreds of millions of dollars. The court ruled unanimously against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a case stemming from operations of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s British subsidiary in the early 1970s. The British subsidiary of the Ohio-based corporation incurred net losses in 1972 and 1973, at least under British tax law. The subsidiary's 1973 loss included British tax deductions that were not allowed under American law. As a result, the British government refunded to the subsidiary tax payments made there for 1970 and 1971. The refunds prompted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to recompute the taxes it said <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> owed in this country. Multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid by subsidiaries overseas as credits against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes. In <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s case, since the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said American law did not recognize the 1973 deductions permitted the company in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the corporation's loss was converted into a profit. The redetermination had the further effect of wiping out, for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax purposes, the foreign tax credits previously allowed <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and 1971. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assessed <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> $ 791,240 in taxes and interest for 1970 and 1971. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> then filed suit in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> erred in applying American law instead of British law to determine the company's accumulated profits. The claims court ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>. But a federal appeals court here reversed the decision last year. The appeals court said a multinational company is entitled to use a foreign nation's tax laws to determine accumulated profits made by a subsidiary in that country. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today overruled the appeals court. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in his opinion for the high court, said the approach favored by <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> would lead to unequal tax treatment for subsidiaries _ as opposed to companies set up as foreign branches of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations _ whenever a foreign government calculates income differently than in this country. That result would not square with federal laws aimed at assuring tax parity between corporations that operate through foreign subsidiaries and those that operate through foreign branches, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, even though <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax law was changed in 1986 to bar multinationals from using a foreign country's calculation of its accumulated profits for most future tax payments here. The department said more than 25,000 foreign subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies do business in more than 100 countries. The government's most recent figures show the companies claimed more than $ 9 billion in foreign tax credits in 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it is reviewing claims for $ 150 million in refunds in such cases. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1474.

 A fierce ice storm left eight people dead and two multimillion-dollar television towers in pieces on the ground, and forecasters said more bad weather was on the way. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a second storm system would hit the state beginning in the mountains tonight and gradually spreading east on Tuesday and Wednesday. The blast of wintry weather that moved into the state over the weekend spread thick layers of ice on roadways and cut off electrical service to thousands. Police reported hundreds of traffic accidents, and at least eight people died. Western states also were hit with wintry conditions. At <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, there were extensive delays Sunday because of the storm but officials said the situation was better today In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> east of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Divide, a slew of car accidents were reported Sunday, including a 20-car pileup on Interstate 25 near <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> that closed the highway for two hours. Three people suffered minor injuries in that accident. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> residents were bundling up as an arctic mass moved in. Early this morning, wind chill temperatures were reported from 20 below zero to 50 below zero. Highs today were forecast 5 below to 5 above, with lows tonight from 10 below to 20 below. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, towers for WPTF-TV and <ORGANIZATION> WRAL-TV </ORGANIZATION>, both Raleigh stations, collapsed Sunday within a half hour of each other, said spokesmen at the stations said. The towers stand side-by-side in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, a community south of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. Witnesses said it appeared melting ice destabilized the 2,000-foot structures. The stations estimated damage to the two towers at $ 12 million and said it could be weeks before they would be broadcasting at full power. `` I heard something. It sounded like ice,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a resident who lives near the towers. `` I saw it folding up just like an accordion or folding ladder.'' Adjacent to the towers, a third tower was left leaning to one side under the weight of the ice. The storm blew in Friday, dumping several inches of snow in the state's northern mountains, and began crawling across the state, spitting sleet and glazing roads with ice. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shillingburg </PERSON> said it was one of the most severe storms the utility has had in recent years. About 8,500 of the utility's 90,000 customers remained without electricity this morning, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said 10,000 Charlotte-area customers were without power at some point during the storm, but service was substantially back to normal today. The storm stranded travelers, both by air and car. Roads in the <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> area Sunday morning where littered with abandoned cars. Many flights were delayed and some were canceled at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. on Saturday as airport officials intermittently closed ice-slickened runways. Sunday evening, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> was killed in a three-vehicle accident on Interstate 70 in <LOCATION> Iredell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the western part of the state. Four other people died in separate icy wrecks on Saturday, while three people were killed in weather-related wrecks Friday.

 The director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> has resigned in the face of criticism over a newspaper report that he told a racist joke in the presence of two Statehouse reporters. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> announced Saturday he was leaving his job after almost 2 -LCB- years, the same day a column about the joke appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Within hours of the column's publication, 22 legislators signed letters expressing anger to Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, and the chairwoman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to call for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s resignation. In the column, reporter <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told a joke that referred to a `` nigger.'' <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON> is an associate professor of journalism at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> who worked for the Times this fall. In his letter of resignation, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> acknowleged making the joke, but said <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON> took it out of context. `` I am sure you are aware that my performance has not indicated that I am a racist,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in his letter. The legislators who condemned <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s conduct did not call for his resignation, though they did suggest that <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> discipline him. Twenty-one legislators signed a letter to <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> drafted by state Rep. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochhauser </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one of four black legislators, drafted another letter. <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the joke last week, when questioned by him and another reporter about a triple murder in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> for which two teen-agers, one black and one white, were arrested. The second reporter, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Correspondent <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, said he initially did not report the joke because it was not made in a public forum, but wrote a story Saturday when he learned of legislators' reactions to <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON>'s column. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 59, became <ORGANIZATION> KBI </ORGANIZATION> director in July 1987, replacing retiring director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had been an investigator for the state <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for three years before taking the position.

 The captain of the USS Iowa said today that he inherited command of a battleship fraught with problems, but that he could not endorse the singling out of a troubled gunner's mate for setting off the explosion that killed 47 crewmen last spring. Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> also told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that allegations of poor training and lack of qualifications leveled against his crew imediately after the explosion April 19 were unwarranted. He said he had no information to dispute the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that the blast was `` a wrongful, intentional act.'' But he said he could not conclude that a single individual was responsible. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> concluded that a depressed Gunner's Mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial because all the witnesses, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, were killed in the blast. `` I do n't think I could definitely say an individual did it,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the explosion acknowledged deficiencies in the way <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailors were supposed to be certified to carry out their jobs aboard ship, but it said these problems did not cause the blast. In the weeks immediately after the blast, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told investigators that he was concerned about the quality of the personnel aboard his ship. He complained that the sailors assigned to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were `` dopers, marginal performers, constant <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- unauthorized absences -RRB-,'' according to published accounts of his testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigastors. He has since said he regreted his harsh remarks about his crews, which he said amounted to an emotional outburst after the tragedy. Asked today about those comments, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told senators: `` You have before you a paradox, a tale of two ships. One ship you read about in the newspapers is a ship of laid-back attitudes, failure and ineptitude. The other <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that I command: well-trained, well-maintained and professional.'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said that when he assumed command of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in May 1988, the ship was fraught with problems, including absenteeism and drug abuse. But in 19 months the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had become one of the finest ships in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and when the explosion ripped through gun turret No. 2, it was `` both a tragedy and the birth of 100 heroes,'' he said. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the blast was `` generally speaking'' fair. The captain said he disagreed with some of the charges of shipboard deficiencies. But when asked if he was aware of any information that would contradict the service's overall conclusions, he said initially, `` Not that I am aware of.'' Shortly after the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> returned home to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, last Thursday, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> also told reporters he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the explosion closes the book on the matter But skeptical lawmakers do not see it the same way. `` We want a resolution to the problems. We want to get to the bottom of it once and for all,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations That panel has scheduled hearings on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion on Tuesday and Wednesday. Among the witnesses scheduled to appear under oath before <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>' subcommittee are <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>; Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who oversaw the technical and criminal study; and <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, a sailor on the ship when an explosion ripped through the lowest level of the No. 2 gun turret. Several analysts from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as well as outside experts will be questioned. In announcing his committee's hearings, <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said the panel has been reviewing `` several aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation _ especially its technical competence and psychological analysis.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat expressed concern about a `` question of interpretation'' of the evidence. In October, <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said he `` seriously questioned'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report, and cited an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report that said its laboratory investigation on the incident was inconclusive. `` We did n't find anything that would lead us to conclude that a device was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said in October. `` That's not to say something was n't there. Our findings were inconclusive.'' In a Nov. 21 memorandum to members of the subcommittee, <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> questioned why the report was described as inconclusive. `` I do not see it that way. It clearly says they did not find elements that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> technicians said they found. Why is there this discrepancy?'' he wrote. <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> also criticized the use of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> psychological profile of the sailors which `` was intended to produce leads; instead, it was used as a key document supporting the investigation.'' Despite the skepticism, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> defended its findings in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said additional technical tests conducted since he issued his report found `` unique foreign material'' on the projectile from the exploding gun barrel that would not have been present during a normal firing. The new tests identified the material as iron wires coated with calcium, chlorine and oxygen, which would be produced by `` some types of non-electronic explosive devices,'' <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said.

 Snow and low temperatures combined to make the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>' roads slick early today, causing numerous road pile-ups. Elsewhere, snow fell in much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and wind-chills far below zero numbed parts of the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. A winter storm warning was posted for locally heavy snow along with gusty winds and low temperatures in a portion of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> including the southern foothills and the <LOCATION> Sangre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristo </LOCATION> mountains. In northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, slippery roads were blamed for accidents involving more than 20 cars near <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sunday night. Numerous minor injuries were reported. Most of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> east of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Divide was hard hit by the storm, which left a slew of motor vehicle accidents in its wake Sunday, including a 20-car pileup on Interstate 25 near <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> that closed the highway for two hours. Three people suffered minor injuries in that accident. Much of the country's northern tier, the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> registered temperatures in the single digits this morning. Wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero were reported in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Snow was reported early today from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Cities blanketed with snow included <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Platte </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. The cold reached down into the panhandle of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where snow was possible today. A winter storm watch for snow and freezing rain also was forecast for tonight and Tuesday over northern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Out West, high winds were expected today across <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where gusts up to 70 mph were possible in the mountains. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the first wintry storm of the season was blamed for the deaths of eight motorists. The storm knocked out power to thousands of households and toppled two television towers before moving out to sea Sunday. Towers for WPTF-TV and <ORGANIZATION> WRAL-TV </ORGANIZATION>, both Raleigh stations, collapsed Sunday within a half-hour of each other, spokesmen for the stations said. The towers stand side-by-side in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> just south of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. The entire nation, however, was n't under a wintry grip. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the temperature reached 73 degrees Sunday, breaking the record for the date.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today expressed `` favorable interest'' in a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> plan to boost the international role of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to a statement from the World War II Allies after a meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The statement was distributed at the end of a 2 -LCB- - hour conference of the ambassadors of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> It was the first such meeting here since 1971. Earlier, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> insisted German reunification will come one day but acknowledged such a step remains a `` vision.'' The meeting was held at Allied headquarters in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, 100 miles inside East German territory. At the 1971 meeting, an agreement was drawn up establishing the rights of the four countries in the city, which has been divided into four sectors since World War II. `` The Western ambassadors set out their proposals under the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> initiative. The Soviet ambassador expressed favorable interest,'' the Allies' statement said. The initiative, outlined by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1987, calls for improving air traffic to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, making the city the site of youth exchanges and international conferences. It also calls for holding the Olympic Games in the city in the future. `` During the meeting there was a common understanding of the importance of stability, and confidence was expressed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could contribute to that on the basis of the quadripartite agreement of 1971,'' the statement said. It added that further meetings may take place. Those attending the meeting, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallaby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Boidevaix </PERSON> _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and French ambassadors to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ and <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochemasov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, made no comment to reporters. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, attending a meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said: `` We do not know when the day will come when this vision -LRB- of reunification -RRB- will become reality, but I am convinced that it will come.'' The West German chancellor was due to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of States <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Tuesday. The meeting had been planned for <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the two would meet in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> later in the day. At the last Four Power conference in 1971, the Soviets agreed to allow unhindered air, rail and automobile traffic between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The agreement also cleared the way for closer ties between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has been in a turmoil since the Communists who led <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for all its 40 years bowed to massive public pressure and decided Nov. 9 to allow free travel to the West. The Berlin Wall and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s other borders, closed since 1961 to end mass defections, were suddenly open. In the month that followed, peaceful popular revolutions have ousted old Communist regimes from power in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, with free elections promised next year. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has proposed a confederation with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that would lead to eventual reunification of the two Germanys. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders have resisted calls for unity but say they back close cooperation with <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> In the tumult, the Four Powers have been largely ignored. At least on paper, the three <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allies </ORGANIZATION> have final say in many significant issues concerning <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Many West Berliners want that to change, and the leaders of the West German city-state have called for a revision of its status.

 <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chayefsky </PERSON>'s `` The Tenth Man,'' revived Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Vivian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, is a savvy mixture of Borscht Belt humor, religious mysticism and old-fashioned melodrama. For much of its three acts, this fine comedy-drama is what used to be called `` a well-made play,'' those expertly constructed entertainments that flourished on Broadway until about the mid-1960s when theater economics skyrocketed and mass audiences dwindled for serious drama. The story, set in 1959 _ the year the play was first presented on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> _ certainly is a sturdy one A group of elderly Orthodox Jews gather at a shabby storefront synagogue on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for morning prayers. But their meditations are interrupted by the arrival of <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, a member of the congregation, who has in tow his granddaughter. She's a mentally disturbed young woman he believes is possessed by an evil spirit called a dybbuk. If the plot sounds familiar, it is. <PERSON> Chayefsky </PERSON>'s play is a variation on `` The Dybbuk,'' <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ansky </PERSON>'s drama which has been a staple of Yiddish theaters in this country since the 1920s. Is the girl possessed or merely insane? <PERSON> Chayefsky </PERSON> shrewly keeps the audience guessinfare for those who like their holiday plays to go on as long as Hanukkah. ... In its eagerness to pander, `` The Tenth Man'' seems as cynical now as the television programming that <PERSON> Chayefsky </PERSON> would later attack in his screenplay for `` Network.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON>, Daily News: The evening has moments of power but lacks the mystery and tension to make the arrival of the title character more than merely funny. The overall feeling is closer to the amiable <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosten </PERSON> than, say, the demonic <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashevis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON>, Newsday: The play manages to be both quaint and vital, neatly old-fashioned and modern, a curiosity, yes, but one that is loaded with the ornary wit, verbal richness and oversized heart that characterized his -LRB- <PERSON> Chayefsky </PERSON>'s -RRB- most enjoyable work.

 <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> may resume diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under overall proposals at a Central American summit here seeking greater involvement by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in settling the two countries' guerrilla wars, a Salvadoran spokesman said today. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, the Salvadoran justice minister, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview he is optimistic about the outcome of the two-day summit by the region's five presidents scheduled to end tonight. `` Last night we clarified various positions and, if everything goes on like this, it is possible that at the end of the meeting we may announce the normalization of relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, a member of his country's delegation. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> said the presidents, in principle, agreed to issue a statement condemning leftist guerrilla attacks in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which was part of an all-out offensive the rebels launched Nov. 11. But he said the statement would not use the term `` terrorist'' in condmenning the rebels, apparently at the request of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> But <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> refused to go into details, other than indicate all five countries are seeking greater <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> involvment to settle the two wars. Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> suspended diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government Nov. 26, one day after two planes that crashed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were found to have been carrying Soviet surface-to-air missiles for the rebels. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is seeking agreement to allow <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers more power and personnel to start disbanding the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels, a source said. For its part, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> rejected a cease-fire proposal by the leftist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, whose offensive was the largest of the decade-old civil war. Under the Nicaraguan plan, the government would consider resuming its cease-fire and `` technical talks'' with the leadership of the Honduras-based rebels after the Contra force is disbanded, the Nicaraguan source said on condition of anonymity. `` The demobilization of the Contras must be complied with,'' said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, referring to an Aug. 7 regional peace agreement under which the guerrillas were to have been disbanded last week. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must begin to function in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The source said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was not optimistic about getting Contra camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> dismantled because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants to keep the Contras alive to ensure <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Feb. 25 presidential elections are free and clean. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government insists the presidents follow through on their agreement that the Contras be demobilized. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group has been sent to the region to verify the Contra repatriation and to make sure no weapons are sent from one country in the region to another's insurgents. The Salvadoran rebel cease-fire proposal was presented by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and rejected by the Salvadoran government, which had offered a possible resumption of talks with the rebels if they stop guerrilla activities in cities. The Salvadoran guerrillas also asked for the dismissal of seven high-ranking military leaders in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and `` full respect for human rights and democratic liberties of political and social organizations.'' At the same time, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> proposed a truce in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> from Tuesday through Jan. 15 to give both sides in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> time to begin negotiations for a permanent cease-fire. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> also proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> be given powers to verify the proposed truce. The five presidents are meeting for the sixth time in 28 months in their search for a peaceful solution to regional conflicts. They are <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Frustration and pessimism prevailed as the summit took place amid what <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> called `` the most difficult moment'' since the peace negotiations began. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of sending missiles to the Salvadoran rebels, while <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> of siding with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and helping the Contras. The role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were also brought up at the meeting. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON>, acknowledged that regional agreements will not have much validity if the superpowers do not support peace and the conflicting parties have close ties to them. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who created the region's original peace plan, on Saturday called the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` two-faced'' and accused them of speaking about peaceful solutions while encouraging military activities. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides aid to the Contras and the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in its fight against leftist rebels backed by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and, at least indirectly, by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>World War II Allies Still Govern Former Nazi Capital</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The four World War II Allies still have final say over <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, although most of the day-to-day administration has been turned over to German authorities. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the former Nazi capital, was conquered in the last few days of World War II by Soviet troops. According to previously made agreements, the city was put under the joint administration of the four victorious powers _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ and each occupied a sector of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The city itself was inside the overall Soviet occupation zone. As the East-West relations worsened, the four-power administration of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> became more and more impractical. In June 1948, the Soviets blockaded the Western sector to try to push the Western powers out of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, which was a Western enclave inside the Soviet occupation zone. The U.S.-led <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> airlift kept about 2 million people in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from starving and the Soviets lifted the blockade in May 1949. When <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was founded in 1949, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was proclaimed its capital, although that violated previous agreements that stipulated that <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> would belong to none of the occupation zones and that it would retain a special status. This special status is still in force, although the Soviets have put virtually all control in local hands. When <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s consitution called <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> a state within the Federal Republic, the Western Allies complained it violated the four-power status. The Allies also emphasized they retained <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> authority </ORGANIZATION> over the Western sector, but they allowed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s integration into the legal, economic, fiscal, monetary and social system of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tolerated this situation for years, after the building of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall in 1961, the Communists started obstructing traffic between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In March 1970, the four powers began negotiating over <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, recognizing that there could be no relaxation of tensions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without an agreement over the divided city. The Four Power Agreement, or the Quadripartite Agreement, was signed on Sept. 3, 1971, and contains practical steps to improve <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s situation. The Soviets no longer disputed the Western presence in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and have accepted its ties to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s right to represent <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> internationally. The 1971 agreement also secured and vastly improved <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s land, rail and waterway links to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. West Berliners were permitted again to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and telephone links between the two sides were restored. But the treaty did not change <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s special legal status and the city remains technically under the four powers' government. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> technically is not part of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and is not governed directly from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Federal laws are applied in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> under a special procedure. The Allies, for instance, still control air traffic to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, French and British airlines are allowed to maintain regular service between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and the outside world.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will continue avoiding high-level contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the wake of the June killing of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the government's top spokeswoman said Monday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will watch developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cautiously while maintaining its freeze on massive loans to the Communist government, Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> said after talks between Japanese leaders and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Sunday after a surprise visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the first Sino-U.S. talks between senior officials since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> barred such contacts after the military crackdown on student-led protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> June 3-4. The major Western democracies agreed at their annual summit in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in July to stop all high-level contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and suspend new credit to protest the crackdown, in which hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed. Scowcroft's visit has drawn criticism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where Chinese dissidents and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deplored President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to resume high-level contacts without improvements in human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> explained to us that this was an exception, and we accept it as such,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the basic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position has changed.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was informed in advance of Scowcroft's visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration did not announce the trip until Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where they briefed Chinese leaders on the U.S.-Soviet summit and discussed bilateral relations. The two met Sunday night with Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and stressed the importance of U.S.-Japan cooperation in relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not be isolated from the rest of the world, but Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will maintain its freeze on $ 5.66 billion in loans imposed following the crackdown. Japanese officials have said there is no timetable for resuming discussions on the loans, originally to have been provided between 1990 and 1995. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also has no plans to send a special envoy of its own to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> capital, Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> said. Japanese business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has become sluggish, with tourism and investment plummeting. Work on at least one major construction project in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> funded by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been abandoned. The chill in Sino-Japanese relations `` is not desirable from the viewpoint of peace and stability in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and both countries should exert efforts toward their improvement,'' Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> told Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> Monday. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> was quoted by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as praising the decision to send the two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and thousands of others at Notre Dame cathedral today mourned the 14 women killed by a gunman last week, and listened to appeals that their deaths help build a better world. `` We have the tools in our hand to build a better world, a world of peace,'' said <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Perreault </PERSON>, president of the students' association at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> engineering school He spoke of the victims' dreams and hopes and urged, `` Let's achieve these great things ... of hope, of understanding. Schools and universities throughout <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> province observed a minute of silence as the joint funeral Mass for nine of the victims started. Families of five of the victims of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s worst mass murder chose private services. Nearly 4,000 dignitaries including <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Mila </PERSON>, students from the engineering school and families of the victims filled the cathedral in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s historic center. A gunman identified by police as <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, 25, killed the women in a rampage through three of the engineering school's six floors on Wednesday before turning his semiautomatic assault rifle on himself. Despite temperatures below freezing, several thousand people listened quietly outside the cathedral to the 80-minute service broadcast on loudspeakers. Cardinal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON>, the city's Roman Catholic archbishop, said in his homily that the women were `` brutally mowed down in the beauty of their youth at a time when everything seemed to assure them of a brilliant future.'' He urged that, with the influence of their deaths, `` We should seek to build a world of solidarity, a world of friendship.'' The funeral followed a day when more than 7,000 people paid final respects to the victims, eight of whose white, flower-draped coffins lay in state at the university's hall of honor. `` We're sort of helpless in a way, but you feel you have to do something,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, an artist waiting in line with a small floral bouquet. The gunman burst into the university's engineering school late Wednesday afternoon on the last day of classes, shouting `` I want the women!'' and `` You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists!'' A suicide letter showed he carried a special grudge against feminists, police said. Thirteen of those who died were students; the other was a school employee. All were between the ages of 21 and 31. The gunman also wounded nine women and four men. Their condition was reported today to be improving. The engineering school started psychological counseling for students and the victims' families and postponed exams until Wednesday. Documents obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> of the divorce of <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>'s parents, which occurred when he was seven, showed that his mother said his father beat her, the boy and his sister. The father believed `` women are not men's equals and that women are servants to men,'' the mother, <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, said at the 1976 hearing. The father, <PERSON> Rachid </PERSON> <PERSON> Liass </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharbi </PERSON>, denied the allegations. <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> was named <PERSON> Gamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharbi </PERSON> but took his mother's name when he was 18. Today's service was for <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Klueznick </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Colgan </PERSON>, 23; <PERSON> Nathalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Croteau </PERSON>, 23; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Daigneault </PERSON>, 22; <PERSON> Anne-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> <PERSON> Haviernick </PERSON>, 29; <PERSON> Maryse </PERSON> <PERSON> Leclair </PERSON>, 23; and <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> St-Arneault </PERSON>, 23.

<HEAD>Honor to Revolutionary Priest Revives Old Grievances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The remains of a revolutionary priest are to be enshrined Tuesday in the hallowed Pantheon in a bicentennial ceremony that has revived 200-year-old grievances of the Roman Catholic church against the French Revolution. Church leaders are boycotting the event, the last planned in a bicentennial year in which the archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> says `` we were invited to commemorate a period when the church was violently persecuted.'' <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON>, better known as the Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON>, fought slavery, proposed the abolition of the monarchy and backed a controversial oath of allegiance to the state that clergy were forced to take. To close out a year of bicentennial parades, exhibits and fireworks, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> decided to honor the Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> and two other revolutionary figures: the philosopher <LOCATION> Condorcet </LOCATION> and the mathematician <PERSON> Gaspard </PERSON> <PERSON> Monge </PERSON>. A solemn ceremony is planned Tuesday evening for the placing of their remains in the Pantheon, a disaffected church in the form of a classical temple on the <LOCATION> Left </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> honors its heroes. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy decided not to send any representatives, although papal nuncio <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonetti </PERSON> will represent Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at the ceremony. The church in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, while no longer the anti-republican force it once was, has not forgotten the revolution's massacres of clergy and violent desecration of churches. The Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> was a central figure in the drama that split the revolution and the church: the 1790 Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which required the clergy to swear allegiance to the state. Many resisted, maintaining their loyalty to the pope, and relations rapidly deteriorated. `` The Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> defended a conception of the church which differs from the Catholic tradition,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was quoted as saying in an interview in <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> in which he explained the decision not to attend the ceremony. But <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON> said he would preside at an Office for the Dead to mark the Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON>'s exhumation from <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, even though his predecessor as archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> refused to authorize a church funeral when <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> died in 1831. The papal nuncio's presence `` confirms the desire of the Holy See to help <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and French Catholics heal the wounds which may remain from the revolutionary crisis and the anti-religious violence early in this century,'' <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON> said he considered it worthwhile to honor the Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> `` because of his struggle for the emancipation of the Jews, for the rights of blacks and the abolition of slavery.'' But he also said the French bishops had tried to maintain their proper role `` with dignity'' throughout the bicentennial celebrations `` in which we were invited to commemorate a period when the church was violently persecuted.'' The French hierarchy's decision not to participate in the ceremony for the Abbe <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> has been questioned discreetly by other church leaders. `` The absence of bishops at the Pantheon will surprise a certain number of Christians. I understand that reaction,'' said <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaporte </PERSON>, the bishop of <LOCATION> Cambrai </LOCATION>. The others being honored Tuesday are less controversial. <PERSON> Jean-Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Caritat </PERSON>, marquis de <LOCATION> Condorcet </LOCATION>, a friend of Voltaire and other `` philosophes,'' opposed the death penalty and favored equal rights for women. During the Jacobin purge of the Girondins he was arrested and died in prison in March 1794. In his case, the transfer of remains is symbolic; his body was thrown in a common grave and never recovered. <PERSON> Gaspard </PERSON> <PERSON> Monge </PERSON>, the inventor of descriptive geometry, served on the revolutionary committee that developed the metric system. He gave courses in manufacture of cannons and powder for the defense of the young republic, and later was close to <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, losing all his honors when <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> fell in 1814.

 <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>'s life started off bad and got worse, but the pudgy, white-bearded, balding man said without those experiences he could n't do what he does best _ be <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> was an abused child and spent time in an outlaw motorcycle gang before a stint in the Marines and marriage helped turn his life around. He's spent the last 14 years as `` Madison's <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' refurbishing and distributing toys to needy children `` The kids let me into their lives every day,'' he said. `` They can relate to me. I know what they're going through. I have not been Mr. <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, but every bit of it gave me a deep knowledge of children I'll never forget.'' The 55-year-old <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>, who also works as an apartment manager, works year-round with a group of volunteer elves to collect and repair old toys in his workshop and distribute them to needy children. Although he never stops being <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, the holidays _ obviously _ are his busiest time of year. `` When Christmas comes, I lose track of everything,'' he said. But <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>, who does n't need pillows or a false beard to look like <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, said this Christmas holds special meaning. `` I'm just thankful to be alive,'' he said, his eyes squinting and his red, round cheeks jiggling with each giggle. `` And I'm thankful for all these fantastic people in this town They blew me away when I was in the hospital.'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> suffered a brain aneurysm in November 1988 that left him in the hospital for three weeks and required surgery. When residents discovered <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> did not have health insurance they started a `` Get Well Santa'' fund and raised more than $ 41,000. `` The people came through for someone in need, just like he does every day for people in need,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahnke </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Don </PERSON>'s Hallmark, who donated space for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s workshop <PERSON> Dahnke </PERSON> said his suppliers of toys, stuffed animals and candy used to think he was joking when he told them about <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> and asked for donations but `` they do n't think it's a joke anymore.'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>'s network of thousands of volunteers reaches across <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and throughout the nation, but even if he had no help, he would still be giving, friends said. `` I know he's gone down to $ 2 in his checkbook to make sure people would have a Christmas dinner,'' <PERSON> Dahnke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> refuses to accept money for being <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, saying `` you ca n't give to those who give.'' He used to hang uncashed checks on his walls and he has a frame of them in his crowded workshop, including a blank one made out to `` Mr. S. Claus.'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> drives a 1972 Dodge with a holiday-style paint job and hugs everyone he meets _ something he has n't always done. `` I was a very abused child,'' he said, with his usually jolly voice turning solemn. `` I equated that violence with love, and I thought I was spreading that love with violence.'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>, whose mother died of cancer when he was 14, said he spent time in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as the president of a motorcycle gang before moving to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` I went there looking for brotherhood and love,'' he said. `` But it was n't there. It's not anywhere but in your heart. I did n't know that then, but I do now.'' <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, has long, wavy hair parted in the middle, wears round, metal-framed glasses and is often called `` Mrs. Claus.'' Mr. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> says she turned his life around. <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> did not choose his first <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> assignment 32 years ago; he was drafted. He was a Marine staff sergeant and was pulled out of his barracks to play <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> `` because they needed someone fat.''

 Former Interior Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today to face <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> has been accused of leading a cocaine trafficking operation while he was <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s top law enforcement official. He also hired Nazi war criminal <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON> to advise his paramilitary forces that tortured and killed opposition political and labor figures. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> secret police under his control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay for protection, and delivered it to smugglers who did pay. Two of his lieutenants charged in the indictment once received $ 1.5 million for cocaine that was confiscated by <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> authorities and stored in bank vaults, according to the indictment. The indictment says <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> personally ordered it released. `` He was indicted along with 18 other individuals and charged with various violations of the criminal drug laws of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Specifically, the charges involved conspiracies related to the importation, distribution and intent to distribute narcotics,'' she said. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said of the extradition, `` It's happening,'' but refused to give any details. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> had a reputation for ruthlessnes and for personally torturing political prisoners. He was named interior minister in 1980 and rounded up hundreds of journalists, political and labor leaders and church officials. He was removed from his post in 1981 under pressure from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1982 and was arrested under the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment. However, he was freed in December 1983 by the outgoing military regime just before Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office. His whereabouts were unknown until his capture Sunday at a ranch near the city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, 350 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. He offered no resistance when hundreds of police officers converged on the ranch.

 The patient getting her tubes tied on the operating table was pulled from a trap near the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that morning. Poking out from under the surgical cloth was her flat paddle of a tail. At the other end, beneath the anesthesia mask, stuck two, 2-inch orange incisors. It took veterinarian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> an hour of donated time to give the 48-pound beaver a tubal ligation and hysterectomy. Her mate then was carried in for a vasectomy. `` If you do n't plan for wildlife in urban areas it becomes a nuisance,'' says wildlife activist <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON>, who initiated the sterilization program in response to what city officials say is a gnawing problem _ the rodents' appetite for city trees. To make a dent in their numbers, several beavers were caught and given contraceptive surgery under the experimental program run by the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> and the citizens' group Wildlife 2000, which <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON> heads. If caught, a dozen more beavers will get the same treatment, and some will get contraceptive implants that release anti-fertility hormones over time. It's one of the first times contraception has been tried in urban-wildlife management, organizers say. The large rodents live among the factories, railyards and highways along the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Strollers and cyclists along a bike trail there were stunned to see program volunteers hoist the caged beavers _ one as heavy as 60 pounds _ out of the water. But along the water's edge are piles of branches and sticks beavers build as lodges and food caches, and also the occasional conical stump with tell-tale tooth marks. Beavers caused an estimated $ 100,000 damage to trees along <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s rivers and creeks last year, said city parks spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulver </PERSON>. `` Having urban wildlife is an amenity. People go to see it, children can learn from it,'' she said. `` But trees are an amenity too. We're trying to find a balance.'' An ordinance passed several years ago outlaws trapping as too dangerous, and besides, says <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON>, `` The general public does n't want animals killed. Her answer: a combination of relocation and family planning. The animals, whose valuable pelts lured some of the first whites to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, were virtually annihilated last century to satisfy demand in eastern and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities for beaver hats. In recent decades, the beaver population along the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> and its tributaries has rebounded, turning the waterways into `` beaver highways,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> of the state widlife division. He estimates that within <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> alone there are about 75 beavers. Decades of development, however, reduced the scrubby vegetation and cottonwood trees along the river. Sometimes those trees were replaced with more expensive varieties. The beavers gnaw what they find. <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON>, who is `` nuts about beavers,'' offered to fix the city's problem by fixing the beavers This summer, she, <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> and a handful of volunteers, including a professional trapper, caught 46 beavers, from Evergreen in the mountains west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to just south of <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION> on the northeastern plains. At a cost to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> of $ 75 per beaver, they relocated them to Rocky Mountain National Park, <LOCATION> Fairplay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Glenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, and other public and private sites where residents were interested in reintroducing beavers. But relocation alone would not reduce <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s beaver population. If a pair is removed, another will take its place. Beavers are monogamous and territorial and will keep the population down on their own if they are n't moved, the two say. `` The whole idea of contraception is that males being very territorial, once they're sterilized they will also prevent fertile males from moving in. We're using wildlife to manage wildlife,'' says <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON>. The sterilization program costs the city nothing. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> donates his time as a member of Wildlife 2000. He performs tubal ligations and vasectomies rather than neutering the animals so they will continue to function as mates and families, only unable to reproduce. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> puts a transmitter into each beaver's abdomen so that Lamb can track their recovery and any subsequent migrations. The division and UNC biology professor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION> will monitor the program's effects on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION>'s beaver population.

 Eight hunger strikers who have occupied the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> since beginning a fast on Thanksgiving to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said today they are ending the fast. Striker <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> said the fast was being called off in part because of pleas from Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and other politicians, and also to encourage others who did not want to take part in a hunger strike to join their cause. `` By ending the hunger strike, we are allowing everybody to participate with us in fighting to stop military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' he said. Their water-only fast began shortly after the murder of six Jesuit priests in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last month. It was in its 19th day today. Doctors had said the the strikers, who were ingesting nothing but water, were entering a critical period that would greatly stress their systems by causing vitamin deficiencies, mineral imbalances and psychological strains. On Sunday, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> went to the church and asked the strikers to suspend their fast until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts on the issue. The governor made the request after joining hands with the strikers in seeking an end to military aid to the Central American country. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called the hunger strikers to urge them to end their strike and he promised that military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> would be a major issue when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes next month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, also urged for the strike to end. The hunger strikers included three refugees from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Another striker is from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, one from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and three from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Roman Catholic church officials have allowed the protesters to stay in the cathedral during the strike, saying they could remain as long as they did n't interrupt services.

 For 15 years, members of the `` Free <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'' movement across the nation have sung, marched, signed petitions, and put their cause on T-shirts and bumper stickers. This week they hope for results. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, now 31, has served nearly half in his life in jail for a murder his supporters say he did n't commit. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce Thursday its recommendation to Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> on whether <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> should be set free. The governor has final say. Petitions with more than 12,000 signatures have been sent to the board and the governor by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Free <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wrote in support of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, his defense attorney. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> applied to the pardon board in 1980 but let the application lapse while he pursued other appeals. An October hearing was the first the board gas held in the case, and the decision expected this week will be its first ruling. In October 1974, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, a black, was in the midst of a heated confrontation over the desegration of schools in <LOCATION> Destrehan </LOCATION>, a small town about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. He was 16. State police in riot gear were patrolling the streets of the town, as were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, now a Republican state representative, was a young <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader who promised to lead armed patrols of Klansmen into town. `` We will help protect white people from rampaging black savages and murders,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> announced then. The situation came to a head when <ORGANIZATION> Destrehan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> was closed early because of a series of racial fights. Teachers tried to put the 1,200 students onto school buses for the trip home. As whites surrounded buses of black students, shouting and hurling bottles, cans and rocks, a shot was fired. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, a 13-year-old white student standing with his mother across the school yard, fell dead. An all-white jury sentenced <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> to death for the shooting. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the state's death penalty law. The conviction has withstood appeals, although a federal appeals court at one time found enough evidence to say that <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> was prevented from getting a fundamentally fair trial. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, who turned down a request for an interview on the advice of his lawyer, always has maintained his innocence. His lawyer said he was a natural target for authorities. `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> was outspoken. He had what was called a smart mouth,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> told the state pardon board. Support for his cause from famous and ordinary citizens has never stopped over the years. Hundreds ringed the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> chanting `` Free <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'' during a 1976 appeal. Several dozen, many of them wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan, sat quietly at the November pardon board hearing. In 1976, protest marches and rallies were held in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and other cities. Pravda wrote about <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> in 1978, calling him a `` political prisoner.'' The British reggae band UB40 recorded a song about <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said much of the money for <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s appeal has come from the committee, which he and a core group of about a dozen workers reactivated about two years ago. Several hundred T-shirts and buttons have been sold. In March, a fund-raiser featured local musicians and poets. The <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> headlined another money-raising concert in August. `` A terrible injustice has been done to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. It's our duty to do everything within our power to set him free,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a state representative. `` The committee is as committed as ever to doing that.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 propelled a military navigation satellite into orbit today to join a network of spacecraft which tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied military forces where they are within 50 feet anywhere in the world. The 128-foot booster blazed away from its launch pad at 1:10 p.m. after being postponed one day because of a problem with a fuel tank pressurization system. The problem was corrected overnight. `` A very smooth flight; the rocket is right on track,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, the launch commentator, as the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 climbed toward orbit. Twenty-five minutes after liftoff, Rand reported the satellite had separated and was in a proper orbit ranging out to 11,000 miles high. `` Everything appears to have gone very well with the flight,'' he said. The payload is a $ 65 million Navstar satellite whose signals are designed to guide military units such as planes, ships, submarines, tanks and land forces with pinpoint accuracy. Four similar satellites, all launched from here earlier this year, are orbiting <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as part of a global navigation network. The military launch was given priority over another rocket whose flight was postponed last week. In that case, the liftoff of a commercial Titan 3 rocket carrying a pair of foreign communications satellites was delayed Thursday night by a computer software problem and again Friday by stormy weather. That launch, now rescheduled for Dec. 20, will be <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>'s first commercial one for paying customers.

<HEAD>Hearing Begins On Asset Freezing In Lincoln Savings Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge opened a hearing today on whether to freeze more than $ 100 million in <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> assets that investors allege were illegally transferred overseas. The plaintiffs contend the assets were transferred out of the country after the investors were misled into buying the high-risk securities known as `` junk bonds.'' Hundreds of small investors in the Irvine-based savings and loan, including a Baptist church located next door to a <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> branch, have asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to freeze the assets of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, members of his family, and others. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was seized April 14 by federal regulators, one day after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection. The Lincoln bailout is expected to require an estimated $ 2 billion in taxpayer money. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> began the hearing by discussing the matter of class action suits and whether to consolidate various lawsuits against <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. The suit <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was hearing is one of several legal actions stemming from the downfall of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and its parent, Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit contends that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> misled 22,000 investors into buying nearly $ 200 million in non-rated high-risk securities at the thrift's 29 branches in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The suit contends that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his family members then unlawfully converted debt-holder funds to their own use by investing the money in banks and companies in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Company spokesmen and attorneys have in the past denied that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> or his executives took part in any fraud. The lawsuit specifically traces about $ 100 million of the funds. Among the allegations were that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> took $ 34 million for his personal use, and caused <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to pay an additional $ 25.5 million to a Dutch company for reasons `` That have never been explained,'' according to the suit. The investors want the assets locked in while the courts decide whether <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his company should pay damages to investors stemming from the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> and the bankruptcy of its parent company <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. AGE DISCRIMINATION The Court ruled that federal judges may help plaintiffs in age discrimination suits try to find other possible victims and seek their participation in such suits. The justices, by a 7-2 vote, ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 1,200 employees at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> plants. The high court said judges in such `` class action'' suits may help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination, who may be unaware of the lawsuit, and solicit their participation. The case is <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, 88-1203. <PERSON> NOFZIGER </PERSON> The court refused to reinstate former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that overturned <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s 1988 conviction, 90-day jail sentence and $ 30,000 fine. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 89-719. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION The court shielded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from having to give <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> documents received from another government agency, narrowing the reach of the Freedom of Information Act. By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheld because they were `` compiled for law enforcement purposes'' and therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy. The case is <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1083. SEATBELTS The court turned away an appeal by an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> woman battling her state's mandatory seatbelt law. The justices, without comment, refused to hear <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s arguments that the law, similar to those in most states, violates her constitutional rights. The case is <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 89-687. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS The court limited the way multinational corporations can use foreign tax laws to reduce their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes, a ruling the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said may save the government hundreds of millions of dollars. The court ruled unanimously against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a case stemming from operations of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s British subsidiary in the early 1970s.

 It wo n't be quite the social event it was 50 years ago and the big stars will be absent, but that's not stopping <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> from throwing a party for this week's re-creation of the premiere of `` Gone With the Wind.'' On the day of the Dec. 15, 1939, premiere, the governor declared a holiday and an estimated 1 million people turned out to see <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s own <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1936 book on which the movie was based. This time, star-seekers will have to settle for 10 minor cast members and five pairs of <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> look-alikes. <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> both died in the 1960s, and Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> died in 1949. The 10 surviving cast members will attend a private reunion Wednesday night and will make a public appearance Thursday. The look-alikes will compete Tuesday, and the winners will appear at Thursday night's antebellum ball. Friday night's `` re-premiere'' will be held at the ornate <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION>, opened on Christmas 1929, since the <LOCATION> Loew </LOCATION>'s Grand Theatre, site of the 1939 gala, is no longer standing. The Fox was saved from the wrecker's ball in the 1970s and now is on the National Register of Historic Places, <PERSON> Cammie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s young daughter, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, said the cast reunion will be a chance for her to reminisce with others who also were children when they appeared in the movie. `` I was 4 -LCB- when they did the filming,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where she manages a contemporary art gallery. She said she remembers `` about 12 snapshots, images'' of the experience, but nothing more. `` You do n't really know how much you remember because people have told you some things,'' she said. `` I certainly remember the pony,'' which killed <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> in a riding accident. `` <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> I remember being a very nice, nice daddy,'' she added. `` He was considerate of me, my mother said. I do n't remember <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> at all.'' Others expected for the reunion are <PERSON> Butterfly </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, who played Prissy; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, all of whom played <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, at various ages; <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiss </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> as an infant; <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s first husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s sisters; and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who played one of the twins courting <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> in the opening scene. Two other surviving cast members _ <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON>, who played <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilkes </LOCATION> _ sent their regrets. Many of the anniversary activities are sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, a division of entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s media empire. Turner acquired the rights to `` Gone With the Wind'' in 1985 when he bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s film library for $ 1.5 billion. And he paid for a restored version of the film that has made a 50th anniversary tour of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> theaters this year. `` It's his favorite movie,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a Turner spokesman. The $ 250,000 restoration process used modern technology to make a new, better quality print from the original negatives. The restored version will be featured at Friday night's `` re-premiere.'' Before the film, a motorcade will shuttle celebrities from <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> for a reception. Afterward, a champagne breakfast will re-create another event from the 1939 gala. Tickets for the evening range from $ 15 to $ 100. Other activities include tours of historic homes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> set her fictional plantation <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>; a GWTW exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; and lectures on Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and her book. Turner's SuperStation <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, whose signal is relayed to cable TV systems by satellite, will broadcast the restored version of the film three times during the week.

He slipped through a back entrance to the high school without comment on Monday, and <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> ordered reporters and photographers out of the building. `` We're going to have a normal school day,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said there were no problems on <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s first day back. Students who gathered outside a fast food restaurant before school began said there had been little discussion of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s return. `` I like him. He's all right,'' said senior <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. Another senior, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Birchfield </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> should be forced to wear dress clothes. `` I do n't think it's right,'' she said. `` I do n't think he should come to school in his work clothes.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who has a farm across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he wears work shirts, jeans and boots because dress clothes hamper his ability to communicate with students. `` There's so many things in my life that I do enjoy, but the one thing I really enjoy is the interaction with the kids,'' he said Sunday.

 The prosecution rested today in the murder trial of a driver who crashed into a church bus, and the defense opened its case with testimony aimed at showing that the bus was n't safe. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fire Marshal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> testified that the seat coverings and cushions on the bus `` were in fact combustible and will burn very rapidly when ignited.'' Lawyers for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> contend an unsafe bus is to blame for the 27 deaths and multiple injuries in the May 14, 1988, disaster south of this <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> community. The bus was built before more stringent federal safety standards went into effect. However, not all of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s testimony supported that contention. The fire marshal also testified that dense black smoke that rolled through the bus could have been caused by the burning of gasoline alone, not by the seat covers. And he said a protective cage around the bus' gas tank would n't have prevented the fire that followed the crash. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, who was driving a black <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> pickup, admits drinking the day of the crash, driving on the wrong side of Interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus. He is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving. The defense phase of the trial is expected to wind up by Friday. Last week, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> presented a detailed reconstruction of the accident, based largely upon weeks of study by <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> trooper <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> `` Sonny'' Cease. The jury also heard testimony from relatives of 26 of the 27 victims, from police and a medical expert about <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s level of drunkenness, and from the state's chief medical examiner about the victims' autopsy results. One survivor of the crash testified that he saw two girls flick cigarette lighters to see inside the darkened bus following the crash. The survivor recalled the fire getting worse the moment the lighters were flicked. Asked about that today, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he did n't believe an additional source of ignition would have made any difference if the fire had already been started.

 More than 100,000 people rallied tonight in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and many urged <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity, a proposal that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief would harm <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking with party chief <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> on Sunday, praised the party's `` rejection of attempts to damage the sovereignty of the country,'' the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> became party chief Saturday. Also today, the four Allied occupiers of divided <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ held their first meeting in 18 years. The Soviets expressed `` favorable interest'' in a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> plan to boost the international role of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to a joint statement. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, it was the fourth straight week that calls for German unity had played a major role in the protests. Pro-democracy demonstrators continue to pressure <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s beleaguered government to carry through with promises for reforms. `` We in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and those in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> -LRB- a West German city -RRB- are and will remain Germans,'' said one <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> speaker, drawing a huge roar of approval from the flag-waving crowd. `` What belongs together will grow together.'' Earlier, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> insisted that reunification will come one day, but acknowledged that for now such a step remains a `` vision.'' The questions of East German sovereignty have become increasingly important with the growing turmoil in the Communist nation. There have been predictions the rapid changes could lead to steps toward unification with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In his conversation with <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also promised <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would consider providing support `` within the current framework of conditions,'' ADN said, without elaborating. The dispatch also did not make clear who called whom. On Sunday, tens of thousands of demonstrators braved bitter cold in eight East German cities to keep up the pressure for change, and <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> called for a clear separation of party and government. Pro-democracy supporters rallied in freezing weather in <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kronskamp </PERSON>, Plauen, <LOCATION> Cottbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ilmenau </PERSON>, according to ADN. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION>, about 15,000 demonstrators turned out for a pro-democracy rally called by the New Forum opposition group. <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Krausse </PERSON>, a physician and member of the New Forum opposition group, told 15,000 people in the southern city of <LOCATION> Ilmenau </LOCATION> that talk of `` anarchy, chaos and violence'' was out of place. Despite that appeal, there was a renewed round of calls for people not to resort to violence as they seek to punish discredited former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rulers, many of whom have been arrested or are being investigated for abuses of power. Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> warned Sunday that `` violence has not been dispelled. An escalation is possible at any moment.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in a speech Sunday, urged East Germans to exercise restraint and keep protests free of violence. Citizens have been disgusted by the reports of high-living and corruption by ousted party officials, and in some cases they have surrounded or stormed local offices of the once-dreaded secret police. The government has claimed that angry citizens have stormed army bases. In the face of massive protests, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the last two months has ousted two sets of leaders, lifted travel restrictions, opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and abandoned its constitutionally guaranteed hold on power. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, 41, said in a television interview that he backed a `` strict division of party and government.'' But he added, `` This ca n't be done in one day. It is a long-term job that is being taken very seriously.'' Such separation would be a striking change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> where, despite recent democratic reforms, party members still hold most of the important positions in the country. There have been warnings that a push toward German reunification, which some recent demonstrations have urged, could cause further troubles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Moslem separatists who kidnapped a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's daughter agreed Monday to free her, apparently after an agreement was reached to release some of their jailed colleagues, a government negotiator said. <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, the youngest daughter of Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, will be released `` any moment,'' said <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Raza </PERSON>, the chief secretary in the northern state of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Raza </PERSON> made his announcement shortly after the Monday evening deadline set by the militants of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to kill the woman unless the government released seven jailed colleagues, including the group's top leader who was arrested last month. Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, 22, was kidnapped at gunpoint Friday in the city of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> as she was going home from work. The abduction was the first major crisis to face the 10-day-old government of Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. His appointment of <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> to the ministry that oversees internal security was seen as a move to appease Moslems who bore the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious riots in the fall. The kidnapping came a day after <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> was appointed head of a government committee aiming to end separatist campaigns in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Sikh militants are demanding an independent nation. Formed in 1965, the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wants <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority, to either become independent or part of neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, an Islamic state. <PERSON> Raza </PERSON> did not disclose the contents of the agreement that he said was reached `` using the services of respectable citizens of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>.'' `` The deadline has no relevance since the negotiations are going on. We hope positive results will come out very soon,'' he said. One of the negotiators contacted by telephone in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> said Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> may be released Tuesday. <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, the summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, is about 93 miles north of <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, the state's winter capital. The negotiator, who did not wish to be identified, said the militants had demanded safe passage for their colleagues freed in the swap. They had agreed to reduce their demand to freedom for five militants, he said. Earlier in the day, a bomb exploded inside an air cargo complex in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, injuring at least 15 people and severely damaging the building, officials said. No one claimed responsibility and it was not immediately known if the blast was related to the kidnapping. <PERSON> Jammu-Kashmnir </PERSON> is the only Moslem majority state in the officially secular, predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state but nationwide comprise only 11 percent of the population. Hindus comprise 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> is claimed both by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the two countries have fought three wars over the territory since they gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947.

<HEAD>65 Bodies of Suspected Sinhalese Radicals Found</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities found the bodies of 65 suspected Sinhalese radicals _ some shot, others burned _ and military officials said Monday that pro-government vigilantes had done the killings. The bodies were discovered after Sinhalese radicals set fire to dozens of public buses over the weekend in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the victims were believed members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government for making peace overtures to Tamil secessionists in the northeast. The front began its campaign in 1987 and has continued to attack the government although its six top leaders were killed last month by government forces. On Sunday, the militants burned 32 government-owned buses in <LOCATION> Ambalantota </LOCATION>, about 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, a government statement said. Also Sunday, at least 16 more government-owned buses were set ablaze in other attacks and two railway engines and a railroad station were burned at <LOCATION> Gampha </LOCATION> district's <LOCATION> Yagoda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the government said. To counter the militant violence, human rights groups say, the government this year set up vigilante groups which have killed hundreds of civilians suspected of associating with the front. The government denies the charge. The military officials on Monday, however, blamed pro-government vigilantes for the killings that were reported since Sunday in the Sinhalese heartland of central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where the front's campaign has focused. Military officials said 21 bodies were found in <LOCATION> Wellawaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Monaragala </LOCATION> district, 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Most of the victims were Sinhalese men between the ages 18 and 30, the officials said. They said 18 bodies were found at <LOCATION> Mavaralla </LOCATION> village in central <LOCATION> Kegalle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, 11 at southern <LOCATION> Hakmana </LOCATION> town, six in the central town of <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> and the nine in other towns. More than 6,000 people have died in the Sinhalese violence that was sparked by an India-sponsored peace accord signed by the government in July 1987 with Tamil rebels demanding a separate homeland for their minority community. The front alleged the accord too many concessions to the Tamils, who are mainly Hindus and comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Tamils claim they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the Sinhalese who are mainly Buddhists and make up 75 percent of the population. The Sinhalese also control the government and the military. The Sinhalese rebels also opposed the presence of Indian peacekeeping troops, deployed in the north and the east to supervise the peace accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has begun withdrawing its soldiers from most areas ahead of a Dec. 31 deadline, but the vacuum has resulted in a power struggle among Tamil groups. Three Tamils were killed late Sunday and early Monday in fighting between two groups, the officials said. At least 10,000 Sri Lankans have died in the Tamil rebellion that started in 1983 and the post-accord violence.

 Drug lord <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was found guilty today of ordering the execution-style murder of police Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a slaying that came to symbolize the nation's battle against illegal drugs The 31-year-old defendant was convicted on all 11 counts of drug conspiracy. Prosecutors charged he had ordered the officer's slaying in the course of running a drug empire that brought in as much as $ 10,000 a week He faces a mandatory life prison term when he is sentenced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON>. The killing of the rookie policemen on Feb. 26, 1988, while he guarded a witness in a drug case became an issue in last year's presidential campaign <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s parents gave their dead son's police badge to then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a campaign appearance, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the slaying as an example of why he believed the death penalty was needed. The verdict came in the third day of deliberations. The panel met for 3 -LCB- hours Friday and a full day Saturday before resuming this morning. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was not present at <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s slaying. Two days before, he had been convicted and jailed for weapons possession. But prosecutors say he sent word from his jail cell to his top lieutenant that he wanted the blood of any police officer. In his closing arguments Friday, defense attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> countered by saying the government's witnesses were admitted murderers, drug addicts and thieves who were given deals for their cooperation. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, 22, was killed instantly by four members of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s gang who pumped five bullets into his head as he sat in his patrol car guarding the firebombed home of a witness in a drug case. The killers were convicted earlier this year and sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in jail. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> has n't been seen much during his trial, which began about two weeks ago. Most days, including today, he has elected to stay in his courthouse holding cell, which is rigged with closed-circuit TV to let him follow the proceedings.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday made employers easier targets for class action age-bias lawsuits by allowing federal judges to lend a hand in alerting possible victims of discrimination. In a 7-2 ruling, the court let judges help plaintiffs in such suits locate other possible victims and seek their participation. The decision is a boost to workers suing <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off or demoting some 1,200 employees at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> plants. In other action, the court: _ Refused to reinstate former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> The justices declined to disturb a federal appeals court ruling that overturned <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s 1988 conviction, 90-day jail sentence and $ 30,000 fine. _ Shielded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from having to give <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> documents received from another government agency, narrowing the reach of the Freedom of Information Act By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents were exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy. _ Unanimously limited the way multinational corporations can use foreign tax laws to reduce their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes, a ruling the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said may save the government hundreds of millions of dollars _ Rejected arguments that <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s mandatory seatbelt law is unconstitutional _ Disbarred former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, from practicing law before the high court and took a first step toward disbarring former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted of racketeering and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of lying to a grand In the age-bias case, the court said federal law permits judges to help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination, who may be unaware of the lawsuit, and solicit their participation. In his opinion for the court, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said judges should have leeway but not `` unbridled discretion'' to manage class action suits in this fashion. That `` serves the legitimate goal'' of avoiding multiple suits in the same case and lets the judge set uniform dates for plaintiffs to announce their participation, he said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> cautioned that judges `` must be scrupulous to respect judicial neutrality'' and `` take care to avoid even the appearance'' they are endorsing a suit. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> joined Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> in dissent. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, writing for both, said federal law does not authorize judges `` to undertake the unheard-of role of midwifing'' lawsuits against employers. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> dismissed or demoted about 1,200 workers Feb. 4, 1985, in what was dubbed `` Black Monday'' by many veteran employees. They said a disproportionately high number of laid-off or demoted workers were over 40 years old. A group of older workers sued, alleging the company violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The group's leaders then sought to contact all fired workers over 40 eligible to join the lawsuit. Some 400 employees agreed to join, but the plaintiffs said they believed there might be 200 or more additional workers who were not aware of the suit and sought to contact them. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> ordered the company to provide the names and addresses of all fired workers. He said that once the workers are found, they may be sent an explanation of the suit and a form seeking their consent to join the court fight. The form said the judge authorized the mailing but took no position on the merits of the case. Increasing the number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big advantage for the workers by helping them spread out court costs. In seeking workers to join the suit against <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, the leaders of the court fight requested a $ 200 contribution to help defray the costs. The stakes also go up for the employer who may be forced to pay damages to more workers.

 Former White House aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> won a legal victory Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to reinstate his 1988 illegal lobbying conviction. `` That kind of news is always welcome. It certainly makes the holiday season a bit brighter,'' said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that overturned <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction on charges he illegally lobbied top presidential aides within a year of leaving the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said dropping any further prosecution of <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> represents `` the only humane course.'' But independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> declined comment, saying he would have an announcement at some future date. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was White House political director from 1981, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, until early 1982. He was convicted of lobbying on behalf of three private clients _ the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maritime workers union and <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and fined $ 30,000.

He was tried under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which imposes a one-year ban on lobbying former colleagues after a person leaves service in the federal government's executive branch. The ban covered lobbying on any matter in which the lobbyist's former agency `` has a direct and substantial interest. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> contended he did not violate the law because he was trying to stimulate, not influence or exploit, White House interest on issues of concern to his clients. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled June 27 that <PERSON> Noziger </PERSON>'s criminal indictment should have been dismissed because it did not charge him with having `` knowingly'' lobbied on matters in which White House officials possessed a direct and substantial interest. In his appeal, independent counsel <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said the appeals court ruling hampers <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' attempt to deal with `` the spectacle of high-level government officials using the ` revolving door' to turn their government service into lucrative lobbying businesses when the ink had barely dried on their resignations.'' Requiring prosecutors to prove a former government employee knew the subject of his lobbying was of `` direct and substantial'' interest to his former agency `` will reward purposeful ignorance or heedlessness,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> argued. Lawyers for <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said the appeals court ruling is unlikely to have any future impact because of legislation enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in November. The legislation, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, eliminates the `` direct and substantial'' interest requirement to create a flat ban on government employees lobbying their former agencies within a year of their resignations.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today defended his decision to send two top aides to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over the weekend, and said he would `` keep looking for ways to find common ground'' with Chinese leaders despite continuing unhappiness with their crackdown last spring against pro-democracy forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed that the trip by national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aide did not amount to normalization of relations. Those who suggest otherwise `` simply do not know what they are talking about,'' he said. Democrats were criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even as he spoke. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said the mission by <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was `` embarrassing kowtowing'' to a brutal regime. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he took the action because `` I do not want to isolate the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people.'' The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains contacts with several countries that have `` egregious records on human rights.'' As for the crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last June, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The Chinese know they have to address themselves to the problems that were inherent in this episode.'' Sanctions imposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the crackdown remain in effect. The president made his comments to a group of editorial writers gathered in an auditorium across the street from the White House. He opened the session with a review of his first year as president. Citing an improved U.S.-Soviet relationship and other developments, he said, `` I'm not overly satisfied but I think generally the first year has gone pretty well.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the economy has continued to expand and create new jobs and that he had `` been able to keep my pledge of no new taxes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said, has enacted a savings and loan bailout bill and made a start on clean air and ethics legislation. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he differed with the Democratic majorities of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over child care legislation, and would press <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass his anti-crime package when it returns in January. `` All in all it's been a productive year, we've proposed a lot of new initiatives,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still planned to attend a drug summit scheduled for next year in <LOCATION> Cartegena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, despite concerns that the visit would pose a security risk. `` I do n't want to send the signal that nobody should go to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, praising the government's efforts to bring the drug traffickers to justice. He added, however that he would reassess the situation prior to the trip. `` I will not do anything imprudent,'' he said. `` Nobody has ever accused me of being too daring.'' As for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded with an emphatic `` No'' when asked if he worried that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger trip would signal the Soviets that he would tolerate a crackdown on pro-democracy demostrators in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I have no concern about that at all as long as we are properly positioned in favor of human rights ... and as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knew that we are not sending a signal of quote total normalization unquote. I will be careful that we do not send that signal,'' he said. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` very pleased today in the wake of General Scowcroft's visit to notice that the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> stated that they would not sell missiles to any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> countries.'' He added that <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> had raised the issue in his weekend talks with Chinese leaders, and the Chinese made their announcement before the national security adviser and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Scowcroft planned to brief <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later today on the trip. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had sent his top aides to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to discuss the results of the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit with the Chinese leaders. `` I do not want to isolate the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. I do n't want to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` I realize the difficulty of this relationshiop but I do n't want to make it any worse,'' he said, referring to the strains following the bloody crackdown against demonstrating students last June He said he was `` going to keep looking for ways to find common ground'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The president made no mention of <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the prominent Chinese dissident who has been given sanctuary from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities in the American Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke against a backdrop of stepped up Democratic criticism of his decision to send Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. `` The administration supports human rights in its words,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It does not do so in its deeds ... These actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for human rights and are inconsistent with our stated ideals.'' The trip was not announced until after the officials had landed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at 1 a.m. EST on Saturday. Scowcroft toasted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders at a televised banquet and called for improved relations `` This trip was not intended to develop normal relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in any immediate sense,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It's going to happen over a longer period of time, we hope, but they're not much different today than it was three days ago.'' `` We have the same concerns. We have the same indignation. We have the same principles. We have the same urgings for their country that we had before,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has seen no changes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s behavior since leaders sent in tanks and troops to <LOCATION> Tienanmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, killing hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators and crushing a months-long protest. `` Enormous changes are taking place in the world. ... We need some uinderstanding of their position'' on the breakthroughs for democracy and freedom in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The Chinese government has been critical of the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The sanctions have not changed. It's not business as usual. ... It simply is the fact we feel <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a country that has to be dealt with,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, barred high-level contacts with Chinese leaders after they sent tanks into Tiananmen Square. He also cut off military sales to the communist regime. The president said relations could not be normalized until the government honored basic human rights. He also gave refuge to Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although he recently vetoed a bill that would have written that protection into law. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> declined to specify issues raised by the two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on their visit. But he acknowledged that the proliferation of ballistic missiles `` has been and remains high on our agenda with the Chinese.'' And he noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government-controlled media termed reports of an impending missile sale to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` groundless'' and said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has no plans to sell such missiles to any Middle Eastern country. `` We think it's noteworth that they reiterated'' the denials, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said.

 It just would n't be Christmas for thousands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinians </LOCATION> if M.L. <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> did n't turn his home, yard and pond into the stuff fairy tales are made of. A dozen trees in the front yard are abloom with colored lights, as are the house, two bridges leading to the pond and the gazebo on an island in the water. Poinsettias form collars at the bases of the trees. Each tier and railing of the white, two-story, colonial-style home is draped with green garland, and wreaths with red bows peek out from every window. From the kitchen window, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>, standing 2 -LCB- feet tall, nod and open and close their arms. The bridges to the pond behind the house also are strung with garlands, and 6-foot candy canes and lollipops stand sentry on the bridge to the island. `` I do n't know whether it's elaborate or not, but it's right attractive,'' Corely said. Some 25,000 people followed homemade traffic signs around his circular driveway last year to view the display in this suburb of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Two weeks after it went up this year on Thanksgiving Day, a traffic counter indicated more than 6,200 people had already taken the tour, which takes visitors from the front of the house around to the back yard and pond. `` And that's not including the people who just drive by the house,'' <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said. `` We get quite a jam here.'' `` The neighbors do n't mind the traffic because they do it, too,'' <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said, referring to less elaborate Christmas displays on his block. <PERSON> Corley </PERSON>, 73, began decorating his home in the late 1940s, then started devoting more time to the display after retiring eight years ago from his sawmill and wood procurement business. Now, the most elaborate setup might be around the gazebo. Poinsettias spread like patches of fiery snow. Giant red, yellow and green lollipops adorn the posts and sides, and a life-sized <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> stands at the back entrance. Despite all the glowing and brightly colored decorations, ducks still come by for a dip in the pond. When Christmas Day draws nearer, a friend posing as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> comes by and hands out candy to visiting children. <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> has n't even tried to count the number of wreaths decorating the property, and as for the number of lights, `` I do n't want to know,'' he said `` I just wanted to thank the good Lord that I was able to decorate so people could come by and see it,'' he said.

 A state judge on Monday reduced to $ 45,000 a $ 1 million award given to a man by a jury that found a Zen Buddhist community next to the plaintiff's property had created a nuisance. The Buddhists had placed 200 fluorescent stakes around the man's property in Pound Ridge and used chain saws and other power equipment at odd hours <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> agreed the Wellspring Zendo created a nuisance, but found there was no basis for so big an award. In addition to cutting the award to $ 45,000, he ordered the religious community to remove the stakes and restrict the use of power equipment to Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. He also directed the group to close windows and doors before their 5 a.m. chant. The jury award was made Friday in a lawsuit filed by homeowner <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitkin </PERSON>, who sought $ 2.5 million, claiming the religious community was trying to intimidate him into moving from the community in southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The community's lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON>, said the ruling would be appealed because of the requirement that the community close its windows and doors during services, which he said was an interference with freedom of religion. `` I do n't think the court has the right to impose such restrictions,'' said <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON>. `` We did n't come here just to fight <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitkin </PERSON>, but because of our religious freedom.'' <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s ruling caps a two-year struggle between <LOCATION> Nitkin </LOCATION> and the Wellspring Zendo community. <PERSON> Nitkin </PERSON>, a real estate lawyer, claimed the religious community had consistently harassed him and his family by clanging cymbals and chanting at 5 a.m. He said the group used power equipment and chain saws at all hours and on weekends and Christmas. He said he and his wife and 2-year-old daughter spend most of their time in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment, even though they had planned to move to Pound Ridge permanently. He said Monday had not yet decided about moving permanently to Pound Ridge. `` Freedom of religion had nothing to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Nitkin </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> `` The Nitkins wanted to enjoy their property. The monetary damages were incidental.'' Wellspring is used as a retreat by 20 to 30 people at a time. The group is suing Pound Ridge for $ 65 million, claiming new ordinances for non-residential uses in residential areas violate their freedom of religion.

 There's a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> here who knows that the little ones are sometimes naughty instead of nice. So he wears extra thick clothing to guard against bites and scratches. `` Santa Paws'' also wears flea and tick powder and keeps a red towel handy for accidents. Santa Paws is <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> major who played <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> last weekend for about 100 animals in a fundraiser for the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. For $ 5, <PERSON> Rover </PERSON> could climb into <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s lap and ask for that extra juicy Christmas bone <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, who has played <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to children as well as animals at the society's animal shelter, said he preferred the latter. `` I've never had a pet that is obnoxious, but every once in a while you get a kid that is,'' said <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, seated in front of a Christmas tree surrounded by unopened Alpo. In four years, he has played <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to dogs and cats of all sizes, ferrets, rabbits, goats and one `` maladjusted mallard'' whose owners said she lays green eggs and hates the water. `` I'm happy no one has brought a snake,'' <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said. He has been bitten only once: last year by a rare Chinese crested dog named <PERSON> Fievel </PERSON>. The tiny terror took a parting nip at his fingers this year but missed. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> brought two nervous cats, `` Lorelei'' and `` Molly,'' and told <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION>, `` They want shrimp and livers for Christmas.'' And yes, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> King discovered, there is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paws </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> woman brought her two poodles, `` Trixie'' and `` Samantha'' to sit on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s lap. `` My children have already grown up,'' she said. `` These are part of my family.''

 The holidays are here and for many people Christmas wo n't be complete until they get a piece of mail from this tiny central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> village. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office here is inundated with requests for a rubber-stamped symbol from the village that stakes claim as home of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, the Red Nosed Reindeer. `` I think it's nifty,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayry </PERSON>, who is running the <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> post office until a permanent postmaster is found. `` I really do. It's something different.'' With a rubber stamper, post office workers press a stamp of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> _ complete with a shiny nose _ on mail. The stamp measures 1.5 inches wide and 2 inches high and is underscored with: `` <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, Home of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, The Red Nosed Reindeer.'' <PERSON> Hayry </PERSON> said some want the stamps to dress up their Christmas cards, while others want it for their stamp collections. Collectors send stamped envelopes with their addresses to the post office and ask that they be sent back with the <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> stamp, he said. Past years' requests have come from more than a dozen states. The idea and original design for the stamp came from <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Blonien </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> postmaster from 1951 to 1971. The <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> character was created in 1939 by <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, a catalog copywriter for <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who wrote a poem about the famous reindeer. A song by <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> followed in 1949, and the rest is history. The village has been around considerably longer.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks Monday to editorial page editors: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, thank you. Please be seated and thank you all for coming. I _ particularly looking forward to this because you do represent a unique category of journalism. What I want to do is just make a few brief comments and then refer _ take your questions for a while. First, just a word on the recent <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> visit. I think it was very promising. We agreed, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I agreed to hold a summit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, next year in June. We agreed that our foreign ninisters would meet in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next month. We are on the brink of exciting new US-Soviet relations and having said that there are still some difficulties. Our secretary of state is abroad right now talking about some of the problems facing <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but basically I end the year more optimistic than when I began it and very encouraged about the change that's taking place inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On the Third World debt question, we came up with a proposal for solving it, the so-called Brady Plan. I want to be sure that we move further during next year in terms of implementation. At least we spelled out some broad parameters in which we _ with which to try to help solve _ in which to try to help solve the problems of Third World debt. But as one who is very interested in this hemisphere, I can tell you that there is enormous interest on the part of our friends to the south, small countries and large, that we get on with this and that our allies and others _ private banking interests _ help us get on with this. On the economy, we end the year with a still growing economy, the lowest unemployment rate in 15 years, and 20.5 million new jobs created over the last several years _ been able to keep my pledge of `` no new taxes'' for this year. And generally, I feel pretty good about it. There's some signs of concern that have been expressed from time to time by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, but I think the main thing now is to keep it growing until every American benefits by this, the longest recovery in history. And on the ethics package _ we sent an ethics package up early. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did incorporate many of the provisions in our government-wide ethics package into the law passed recently that was coupled with the congressional pay raise. I think the reform was long overdue. We did n't get everything we want, but we made a beginning out there. On S & amp; Ls, the package, which was not easy to come by, guarantees depositors that money will be safe and sets tough new standards to ensure that the crisis does n't happen again. I'm disappointed in some ways with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and with our progress, or lack thereof, in some areas. The crime package _ we sent a comprehensive violent crime control package which proposes augmenting enforcement and prosecution, strengthening current law, restricting certain semi-automatic weapons and expanding prison capacity. But, very candidly, it has not been acted on; so I'm going to have to come back now after the first of the year and try to push on that. Clean air _ the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> took steps toward _ took some steps toward passing our bill this year, but we had some good clean air proposals. They were widely received, bipartisan fashion, but I'm disappointed that we have n't gone further there. Child care _ I'm in a fight with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in terms of philosophy on child care. I want to have as much choice as possible. We sent up a new major _ a new child-care bill and proposed $ 250 million increase in <LOCATION> Headstart </LOCATION> this year, too. And now we're in the final throes of our budget process, addressing these questions again. But I think you'll see some early action on child care. All in all, it's been a productive year. We've proposed a lot of new initiatives. We _ I exercised the veto 10 times, and to date, was not overridden on it. We've made progress. I did n't mention the minimum wage, for example, but I had to hold the line on what I though was right, and then we did pass it at the level that I suggested. But I am not overly satisfied, but I think generally that the first year has gone pretty well.

 Continued violence against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s political opposition would ensure that February's national elections will be dismissed as illegitimate, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government `` is at a crossroads,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. `` It can hold free and fair elections without violence and intimidation, and begin the process of bringing peace to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Or it can continue to turn the thugs loose on peaceful opposition rallies, thereby ensuring the election results will be deemed illegitimate and that the crisis in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will continue,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. The comments were triggered by a Sunday rally by the opposition coalition <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, which turned into a machete-slashing riot that left one dead and more than 20 injured. Foreign observers blamed <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers for the violence. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> characterized the provocateurs as `` a Sandinista-controlled mob wielding clubs and machetes'' and said `` Sandinista police and security forces, though asked to intervene by international observers, did nothing to halt the violence.'' The opposition, a coalition of more than a dozen parties, is promoting publisher <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> as its candidate to replace <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as president in elections set for Feb. 25. One American observer, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, said it was clear the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> precipitated the riot. `` There were rocks being thrown, there were boards with nails, and somebody was macheted to death in front of me,'' said <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, former campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and an opponent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of support for the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels. `` And there were bullets being fired. So you ca n't look at this incident today and not say that this thing was completely out of hand. And what the <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> was trying to do was have a rally _ a regular, old political rally. And it turned into a bloody, nasty massacre.'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said one <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> supporter was killed by a machete just a few feet from him, and one woman lost her arm when she was hacked by a machete. `` I thought I'd seen some politics in my life, but this one _ this was more politics than I'll ever want to see, frankly,'' he said. `` It was very ugly, and I think the sad part about it is, you ca n't witness what we saw today and believe there's any way there'll be a fair election in this country.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> called it `` the latest in a string of Sandinista-sponsored attacks on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal opposition'' since a cease-fire with the Contra rebels was lifted Nov. 1. As an example, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said a `` Sandinista mob'' attacked a peaceful <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> meeting Dec. 3 at <LOCATION> Cofradias </LOCATION>, a village 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, leaving 20 people injured, including women and children. `` The Sandinistas promised -LRB- in signing a regional peace accord -RRB- to hold free and fair elections,'' he said. `` We call on them to live up to this promise by ending attacks on the opposition.''

 Federal officials are expected to drop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> as a defendant in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit stemming from the failure of a savings and loan run by his brother, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, 62, president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the joint business operations of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has demonstrated to federal lawyers that he served more briefly than public records stated as a director of the parent company of the failed thrift, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources it said were familiar with the case. The lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency responsible for cleaning up the thrift industry, accuses <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and other senior company officers of devising a scheme to loot money from <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his son and five other top company executives are accused under civil fraud and racketeering statutes <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is not accused of fraud and racketeering, but is named in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a former congressman, has said he served on the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> from February to August 1986. The newspaper reported that he had said he left the board because he did n't have time to travel from his home in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to board meetings in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The federal lawsuit said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> served on the board of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> until March 1987. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection the next month. A day after the filing, federal regulators seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, whose losses of federally insured deposits are projected to reach $ 2 billion. The newspaper said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> declined to be interviewed concerning the lawsuit. A secretary in his <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> office said he was out of town on a business trip Monday and unavailable for comment. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, would say only that `` we're taking steps'' to remove <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> from the lawsuit, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said federal officials were expected to drop <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> from the lawsuit within days, but were expected to reserve the right to reinstate him if warranted by new facts. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Monday she could not immediately provide comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> story. The newspapers said that removal of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> from the lawsuit would lift a cloud that has hung over the man who has had a distinguished record as a newspaper executive and public official. In addition to two terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is a former municipal and common pleas judge and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> city councilman. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> also is chairman of the board of directors of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Also involved in the controversy are five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators who received campaign contributions from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The senators are being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for their involvement on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf. The newspaper said there is no evidence <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> received any large amounts of money from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> other than fees paid for attending directors' meetings. It said payments to directors ranged from $ 3,500 to $ 7,000 per meeting between 1985 and 1987. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> owned 1,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> stock but there is no indication he sold the stock back to the company, the newspaper reported. Among the inquiries into <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s financial activities is one involving <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of $ 16 million in company stock from him and his immediate family under an Employee Stock Ownership Plan financed with money borrowed against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s assets <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has denied wrongdoing.

 I do want to make one comment before taking questions on the recent visit of Gen. Scowcroft to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. There's a lot of interest in that. And following the meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it seemed to me that it would be appropriate to brief the Chinese leaders. I made clear to them before the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting that I wanted to do this. I must say, I was very pleased today in the wake of Gen. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>'s visit to notice that the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> stated that they would not sell missiles to any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries. That subject was raised by Gen. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, and in my view, it's a very sound development. And I do not want to isolate the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. I do n't want to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. We have certain sanctions. I hope I need n't reiterate my concerns about the events that took place in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. I think we were positioned in the forefront of human rights concerns. But _ and I think the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> know that they still have to address themselves to the problems that were inherent in this episode. But I do n't want to see that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains totally isolated. I do n't want to take any further steps that are going to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. And I was very pleased that this statement on the missiles subject having been raised by Gen. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> took place before he barely hit the ground here. There was some discussion about the <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON> bill, and some political figures accusing me of not caring about human rights because I would not sign that bill. We have enacted by executive order everything that that bill did _ would have done _ and I want to keep control of managing the foreign policy of this country as much as I can. And I did n't think that legislation was necessary, and I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes back and takes a hard look at that and then we'll go forward together as we have in the past. But generally speaking, I realize the difficulty of this relationship, but I do n't want to make it any worse. I'd like to think it would improve. We have contacts with countries that _ that have egregious records on human rights and _ so I am going to keep looking for ways to find common ground, but I realize _ and I would say to those who are out there churning around, saying that we have normalized relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that they simply do not know what they are talking about. Now, I will be glad to take any question. Yes, sir? Q: Mr. President ... Since the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has expressed some disappointment with regard to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s activities in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> consequently. Does this reflect the views of the administration or did you pick up at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting some indication that the Soviets may be more forthcoming and cooperative as our relationship develops? A: Well, I expressed the views of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting that I was concerned about their actions in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and so I think the Vice President was reiterating a view that he knew I held. I'd like to think there would be some _ some change in their philosophy there. I had a phone call that I told Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about, from <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, in which <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> simply asked me to raise with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the question of Soviet support for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> putting a lot of blame on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for the export of revolution into these fragile democracies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and, indeed, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. So I raised the question very forcefully, and I hope that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> got the message that it is impossible to have totally smooth relations with us as long as they are supporting the export of revolution into these democratically elected countries. So there is no difference between myself and the vice president on this matter, and he was reiterating, really, a position that I have taken. I'll try to go from side-to-side. Sir?

 Actor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, recovering from a severe head injury he suffered in a motorcycle accident, says he has changed his mind and now advocates the use of helmets. `` Next time you're doing 45 mph, look at the curb and think about slam-dancing with it once, and you'll start thinking about helmets,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said recently on the `` Arsenio Hall Show.'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> was not wearing a helmet a year ago when his motorcycle struck a curb in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, resulting in a severe head injury. In the months following the accident, he insisted on his right not to wear head protection while biking. Before the accident, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> and others helped defeat a proposed state law forcing motorcycle riders to wear helmets. But during the appearance on the syndicated television show, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> told Hall he had a change of heart. `` I have a whole new attitude about helmeting, my attitude now is becoming helmet-conscious, to wear one,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said.

 Q: Mr. President ... Do you think the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is inspiring or orchestrating at least part of the intifada riot activity? And if so, do you think <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be pressured or obliged to negotiate on any more than elections until this violence subsides? A: I do n't think <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be pressured into negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Is that the question? Q: Yes. A: No, they should not be. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is working out a very difficult formulation with the Israelis, with the Egyptians, under which the representatives of Palestinian people would sit down and talk. And it has been very difficult. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, you remember, had his 10 points; <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> came up with five points. There has been progress on that, incidentally, but I do n't think it is the role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Yes, sir? Q: Mr. President ... Can you envisage any steps the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government might take that would lead to the lifting of the sanctions that are now in place? A: Yes, but I'm not going to detail them for you. The question was can I envisage steps that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government can take that would result in the lifting of the sanctions. Yes, and we have had an opportunity to discuss that at very high levels in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> _ in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> hierarchy. And I _ I think it is important that they know how we feel on this question as to _ as to what changes need to take place. But let me reiterate, there has not been normalization of relations because Gen. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, at my request _ and it was my idea, my _ -LRB- laughing -RRB- _ my suggestion _ went over there and had very high level talks in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Who had it over here? Yes? Q: Mr. President, could you discuss the question of German reunification, particularly what steps need to be taken internationally to deal with that question _ the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference, possibly a second one; possibly a peace conference to settle borders? If you would _ A: Well, I think the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement speaks to the question of borders, and it does provide for peaceful change, but it mainly recognizes existing borders, and that is a given, that is a position that we respect and that we support. What we are not _ I think it's very important that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not appear to be trying to accelerate the change in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, that we not be out setting timetables or suggesting how fast this question _ very difficult question for some _ of German reunification be addressed. And so, what we've done is simply let the process go forward. We _ I _ look, I have n't been able to predict the rapidity of change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. And if you find somebody that has, please let me know who that clairvoyant so-and-so is, because I do n't think there is anybody that has been totally right. But, we put on the table _ and I do n't have them with me _ four points that should guide the question of German reunification, but it is not _ it is one that is highly sensitive to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And we do n't have to do it just their way. It is of some concern to some of our European allies. But the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> position and the position at <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> guide the <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> view still on German reunification. Yes? Q: Just one follow-up to that. Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has made the point that <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> solves it only in a political context, and you need a peace treaty to deal with the border question in international law. A: Well, eventually I think that you can _ we can address ourselves to that question. As you know, you have the Four Power occupying provisions. But, I do n't think that it's in our interest to be setting dates for the finalization of this. Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is discussing that at this very minute with our various friends abroad. But the thing _ and I do n't want to come out looking like I oppose change from the status quo in the GDR, but I just do n't want to be in the position of trying to accelerate the question of German reunification. It's too sensitive, and it's not the role for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do that Sir? And then you, I'm sorry.

<HEAD>Drama in the Kremlin: A Tough Weekend For Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An infuriated <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> clashed with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conservatives at a tense, 10-hour <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting that included an especially harsh personal attack, according to accounts surfacing Monday. When the doors opened Saturday, however, the 58-year-old Kremlin leader emerged `` in excellent shape,'' a participant said, with his stature reinforced with yet another party post, and even the conservatives conceded that there were no alternatives to his reforms. There was high drama at the plenary session of the party's 250-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with party officials reportedly objecting to everything from the excesses of glasnost to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s kowtowing to the West At one point, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> even threatened to resign. `` Nobody argued against perestroika as the only policy capable of leading the country and society out of the difficult situation where they are now,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, who on condition of not being identified by name gave a richly detailed account of the strife at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Despite glasnost, the openness policy instituted under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, proceedings in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are cloaked in secrecy. But some members did talk about the session, which even by party ideologue <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s account was peppered with `` dogmatic and conservative'' criticism. The critics' argument was that `` foreign countries are praising us for perestroika, consequently, our way is wrong,'' Estonian Premier <PERSON> Indrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Toome </PERSON>, a reformer, told his Baltic republic's youth daily <ORGANIZATION> Noorte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haal </ORGANIZATION>. The policy-making body convened at a time of unprecedented pressure on the party, with <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> two days earlier revoking its constitutional monopoly on power. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned Communists their comrades' ouster in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> shows they must act quickly to solve Soviet woes. `` The truth, about which we spoke so often in the past years, has been reaffirmed once again _ where there is a delay in dealing with overripe problems, excesses are inevitable,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in remarks reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, an avowed conservative, said high-ranking party officials criticized a purported surge of pacifism and the Soviet leader's foreign trips aimed at reducing East-West tensions. The source said that at one point, the balding 59-year-old party leader from the Siberian region of <LOCATION> Kemerovo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>, `` carried away by emotions, said something like this: ` Is it a proper thing to go bowing to the capitalists? To go asking for a blessing from the pope?''' `` It touched <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the raw,'' the source said. Visibly infuriated, the Soviet leader interrupted <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> and reportedly said: `` Just a minute. We in the Politburo think our policy is justified. But if the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has another opinion, you are welcome to express it, and then we'll decide if we should resign or not.'' Immediately, the source said, speakers took the floor in favor of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the 12-member Politburo `` and the incident was exhausted.'' Later, he said, <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> apologized for `` a slip of the tongue.'' <PERSON> Toome </PERSON>, quoted in Sunday' Noorte Haal, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` he did not care about remaining in power'' and that his reforms were for the good of Soviets, not foreigners. `` If you really think like that, let's discuss it,'' Toome quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as telling critics. <PERSON> Toome </PERSON>'s remarks in the paper were read over the phone by <PERSON> Hirv </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, editor of Pravda and a newly appointed secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviet leader did not make a serious offer to resign, but merely employed `` an oratorical method.'' Reaffirming his support for perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` definitely and emphatically indicated the solidness of this line and his personal devotion to it, and very sharply said this was the only line for him,'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said. `` Can you interpret this as actually posing a question about his resignation?'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> emerged reinforced from the meeting, adding to his posts of party general secretary and Soviet president the newly created job of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation. All votes at the meeting, except one, were unanimous, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> source said. Rank-and-file Communists rallied in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> three days before the plenum to support <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> against what they predicted would be a bid by hard-liners to oust him. The committee member said some sort of attempt at calling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to account may have been in the works, but that he staved it off. `` I was ready for a shakeup,'' the official recalled. `` In the beginning, there was really a tense moment when, in discussing the agenda, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> -LRB- first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- suggested including the current situation in the country.'' That would have turned the plenum into a tribunal passing judgment on perestroika. But the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> shortcircuited the proposal: `` Immediately, it alerted everyone, as if something really big was going to happen and <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> was no more than a pawn in someone else's game. But at that very moment, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> put the motion to a vote, saying: ` Do n't these questions we are going to discuss embrace the current situation?''' Only <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> voted in favor, the source said. `` That put everyone at ease, and the plenum proceeded as planned,'' he said. Other party chieftains, including <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON>, criticized the Politburo for reacting slowly to events, the greater openness in Soviet society or <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s failure to stem pro-independence movements in the Baltic and ethnic clashes and separatist drives in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, the source said. <PERSON> Toome </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Noorte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haal </ORGANIZATION> `` about 30 people'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> want <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> removed, but said there was no talk Saturday of replacing him. Interviewed after the plenum, he said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was unbowed by conservative criticism. `` The general secretary and president is in excellent shape,'' <PERSON> Toome </PERSON> said. `` It is evident he will not give up in favor of the opposition. He has not used all his artillery yet.''

<TEXT>
 Defense consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and a former corporate executive went on trial Monday on charges of conspiring to bribe a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer to help a private company get <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The trial is the second since the government's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud, nicknamed `` Operation Ill Wind,'' became public 18 months ago. More than 25 individuals and four corporations have been convicted. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, described in court papers throughout the government investigation of defense procurement fraud as a major figure in the case, is accused along with <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> of participating in the scheme to bribe former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. `` This is a case about bribery and corruption,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHenzel </PERSON> told federal court jurors. `` <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> were involved in a six-year pattern of making payments to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> DeHenzel </PERSON> said that in return for receiving more than $ 80,000 over the six-year period <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> helped Lee Telecommunications obtain <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> electronics contracts. In addition <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> would modify the contracts to increase their value to the company, which became a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who has pleaded guilty to separate charges in the investigation, is expected to testify as a government witness. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, a minority stockholder in <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, opposed the scheme to bribe <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, argued his lawyer, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Topel </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> protested to company officials, `` he was told to mind his own business,'' <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> told jurors. On several occasions, <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> argued, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> appeared to support the scheme in discussions with defense consultants who served as conduits for the payments to <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> privately opposed the payments in meetings with company officials, <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said. `` He is not guilty of the offenses,'' <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said. `` He is an innocent man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> described <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> as being as `` crooked as the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' `` He is on the take everywhere,'' the defense lawyer said. <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, both former corporate executives, were prepared to testify that <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> was not involved in the bribery scheme. Both men have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>. If convicted, <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> could receive up to 70 years in prison and be fined as much as $ 1.04 million. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> could receive a 95-year sentence and be fined up to $ 1.53 million if convicted of the charges.

 Q: Mr. President ... I was interested in your observation about <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles, and I wondered what makes that different? The Chinese for years, when we were so concerned about the missiles at the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, were denying that they had sent missiles to anybody. Why is this substantively different? And why is it suddenly important now? A: Well, because we've represented, sir, that they ought not to be selling missiles into the unstable <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. And for this to have been raised now and then having this instant response, I view that as good. Q: But they've said that before. A: Well, if they proved to not be telling the truth, that would n't be good. But _ so, I think _ you say what's different about it? I think the fact that it was raised and then responded to with this rapidity is a good sign. There are many issues of difference that we have with the Chinese _ or potential difference. And so, I think that one does not address itself to human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but I think it's important. I think it's important that a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official sat down with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; 24 hours later, we were told this. And, you know, if it works out badly, why, it would n't be productive. Yes, Ma'am? Q: At a time when a powerful individual such as <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> can be killed by terrorists, does n't it seem extremely risky to be attending the drug summit in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>? I wonder if you've reconsidered attending? A: Well, I _ I'm going to take a look at that situation, but we got a courageous president in Mr. <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, and I do n't know that _ well, I'll put it this way: I do n't want to send some signal that <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> can not provide the proper security for three heads of state visiting his country. I do n't want to undermine the courageous stance he's taking by my taking a view that would hurt what he's trying to do. And I'm sure that if he _ if the security concerns are raised to him, that we have a long time before the meeting, but near the time of the meeting he would agree with the objective assessments. But right now I'm very hopeful that the meeting will take place in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>. And I have so much respect for him, and I know the enormous problem he's under from people that want him to give up the fight on extradition, or fight against the narco traffickers. And I do n't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should go to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because they ca n't be protected. So I've got time to take a final decision on that. I will listen to the experts. I will not do anything imprudent. Nobody has ever accused me of being too daring _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ and so I will _ but I do n't want to send _ I do n't want to undermine this courageous leader. Sir? Q: Mr. President ... I was wondering, in terms of the German question, whether you could give us a better, more detailed sense of your discussions with President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on that matter? And also what type of steps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with or without the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, can take to prevent that situation from kind of reaching _ the type of situation you seem to be concerned about now? A: How the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can affect that? Q: How the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> could do it by itself or if there's a need for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to work jointly. A: Well, one thing you do is keep from doing imprudent things. There was a while when I was being criticized for not waxing enthusiastic enough. Some even suggested that it would be appropriate for the president to rush over to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to show his excitement. I was excited, but I thought it would be foolish to go to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION>, because you could _ you could evoke a response that would be _ could have been totally counterproductive. But this is the kind of subject that we can discuss with the head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but it's not going to be determined between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Now that's the kind of the spirit that's in the past, that he and I would sit down and try to determine the fate of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. That is not the role that I'm going to play. That's not the role for the President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And so we will watch the procedures. We'll have the talks that you've read about in the last couple of days, these four-power talks at an ambassadorial level. We will stay in touch so we do n't miss a signal of some sort But this is a matter for the German people to decide. It is n't a matter that's going to be determined by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And so that's the way I look at it and that's the way our policy is being conducted now Yes, sir?

<TEXT>
 Q: ... Mr. President, I think it can be said, and I think most people agree, that the events of the last year indicate that the Cold War has been going our way. Can we say the same thing about the economic competition that we've had overseas? And given the events that have unfolded in the last few months, is your administration now going to put more focus on the latter rather than the former? A: Well, I do n't know about more focus, but we're going to put plenty of focus on it, because you raise a very important question _ the question of fairness in trade. And we have tried, through a very tough and honest negotiator, our trade representative, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, to make the point that if we're going to go forward with these trade relationships, we've got to be _ they have to be fair _ fair trade. I have made the point on several occasions to Mr. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> and to our trading partners in various settings with our European friends that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are properly insisting that the barriers come down. I remain committed to free trade, but it's got to be fair. And I do think we can do a better job of showing our concern about that. And I'm going to try to resist protectionist legislation when it comes down the pike _ pure protectionist _ but the way to avoid it is for us to make more progress in the negotiations. So I think you'll see a heightened attention to trade matters. I'm going to avoid bashing some trading partner, popular though that might be in the political arena. I think it's bad foreign policy, and I think it's bad for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a whole. But I am not sanguine, I am not relaxed about where we stand, and I will fight hard to have our people _ Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USTR </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> _ make progress in all these forums on international trade. I hope that the political changes continue around the world, thus lessening tensions, so that we can put a lot more attention on the trade sector. I do n't want to reply to that part of your question that I think that things are so good in terms of the change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or changes with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that we can totally relax. I know they're not that good with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, for example. Yes, sir? Q: ... Mr. President are you not concerned that your warming relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may send the wrong signal to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> about future possible repression of the unrest? A: No, I have no concern about that at all, as long as we are positioned in favor of human rights and against totalitarian oppression. And I think we are properly positioned. But we have _ as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a billion-plus people, they have a strategic position in the world that remains important to us. And I'd like to think that they will redress some of the grievances that continue to exist. And as long as <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knows that we're not sending a signal of, quote, `` total normalization,'' unquote, I think there's no risk in what you're _ in your question. But I will be very careful that we do n't send that signal. And I think, given the recent meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, I think it's very little likelihood of that misunderstanding cropping up. Sir? Q: ... As you know, we've just had a very close election in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. And the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate we think has won _ we have to wait for a recount on that _ by a very narrow margin. And some say that he won primarily because of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate's rigid opposition to abortion Many Democrats are very gleeful over the fact also that as the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall collapses, so will the Republican party, because anti-communism has been the fuel that kept the party moving all these years. My question to you, as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, are you losing any sleep these days over the future of your party? A: No, none at all. And I've read some of that balderdash out there. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. The Democrats hold a seat, hold a gubernatorial seat, and they dance around the grave of what they hope is the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. And they're wrong, because the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have not changed their fundamental views that had them support me over my opponent. And so I, you know, these elections come and go. The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> election was a Democrat holding the seat of another Democrat. So, I do n't see enormous amount to rejoice in that, nor do I see a turning down of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because a mayor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wins by 2 percentage points over a Republican. The story is _ please write it down _ that a Republican got 48 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. And so I do n't _ I do n't accept all that. And I know there's a lively debate on some of these social issues. But, I also know that we are getting credit as a party for handling, I hope properly, some of the changes that are taking place in the world. And having a global vision, and trying to do at home those things that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want. I cited some of my frustrations, but I also cited some steps that have gone reasonably well. But I think we have a sound agenda, a national agenda, and I think that will benefit the party in the future. So, for those who want to read something into Virginians holding onto the gubernatorial seat, that's their pleasure. But, I have n't lost a wink, really. Yes?

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> cautioned West German leaders Monday that they alone can not decide the pace of reunification with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> flew here for talks with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and a visit to the now-porous <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall after a stop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. There he reaffirmed a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relationship with the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Marager </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and said he did not believe the two close allies were drifting apart. `` I do n't think there are any fences that need mending,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said after a 50-minute conversation with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at No. 10 Downing St. `` We feel a special relation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and to the prime minister.'' He said there had been `` some minsuderstanding'' of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Dec. 4 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for `` perhaps even an intensified effort'' at economic and political integration of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has resisted most moves in that direction, but gone along reluctantly. Overriding her objections, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday made steps toward creating a central bank and a common currency for the 12-nation region. `` I do n't think the differences were as real as they were portrayed in the British press,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters later as he flew to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Besides, he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not take a position on the pace of integration because it is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> then went on to offer some pointed advice to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose 10-point program for German reunification has raised concerns in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the four World War II allies who have final say in running <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have `` roles and responsibilities'' that must be respected in deciding the country's destiny. `` There has never been any peace treaty signed between the allies and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and there are certain retained rights which the four powers have,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters. He cited as an example access to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by the four wartime powers: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In that regard, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recalled former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for improved air service. `` So there are some reserve roles and responsibilities there,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked if the Germans would require the concurrence of the four powers to reunite the country, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that was a legal question that would keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign ministries busy. But when asked for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy position, he said `` There is a certain reserved role and certain responsibilities reserved under the allied powers that have got to be considered when you deal with the question of German reunification. These things have to be considered and dealt with.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will have breakfast with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday, ceremonially sign the city's Golden Book, and make a low-key visit to the Berlin Wall, the concrete Cold War symbol of East-West division. Millions of East Germans have passed through the wall in the month since the Communist government lifted travel restrictions. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> then will make a speech to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> press club in which he is expected to elaborate on his theme that German reunification should be anchored to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organiyation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Agreement signed by 32 European countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would like to see reunification develop in a peaceful and productive way `` Working together with all of our allies, and that includes the <LOCATION> Federal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, and taking into consideration the concerns of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s neighbors, we can have influence on the process,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He agreed with a reporter's suggestion that the upheaval in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> comes partly from the streets and may not be manageable by the superpowers. `` But we are doing, I think, what we should be doing, and what is responsible under the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Kankakee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member was charged Monday with murder and arson in the deaths of his three children and a fourth youngster in a fire at their mother's home, authorities said. <PERSON> Bernon </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howery </PERSON>, 38, in his second term on the board, was ordered held without bond on four charges of first-degree murder and one of aggravated arson, Police Chief <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> said. During questioning, `` Mr. <PERSON> Howery </PERSON> implicated himself in the cause of this fire,'' <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> said, declining to elaborate. The case is to go to a grand jury Friday, said Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorski </PERSON> <PERSON> Howery </PERSON> is scheduled for arraignment Dec. 18. The bodies of <PERSON> Justina </PERSON> <PERSON> Howery </PERSON>, 5; her sister, <ORGANIZATION> Prima </ORGANIZATION>, 10; their brother, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, 9; and half-sister <PERSON> Ledonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Walls </PERSON>, 11, were found early Saturday in an upstairs closet a short time after fire engulfed their mother's home in this community of 31,000 about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The fire appeared to have been started in piles of clothes placed at several locations in the house, according to police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON>. Fire Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuis </PERSON> said investigators were still trying to determine if an accelerant had been used. All four children were left Friday evening by their mother, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Walls </PERSON>, in the care of her 27-year-old brother, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Walls </PERSON>, who lives with her and the children, <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON> said. Later in the evening, <PERSON> Howery </PERSON> visited and Walls left, <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON> said. Later, <PERSON> Howery </PERSON> also left to run an errand, leaving the children unattended, <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON> said. Authorities believe the fire was started before <PERSON> Howery </PERSON> departed, <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> said. Firefighters found no sign of a smoke detector in the house, and considered it odd that the children had not broken an outside window in the walk-in closet where their bodies were found, <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON> said. `` Breaking the window would have saved their lives,'' he said. Authorities backed off Sunday from their allegations that two of the children may have been sexually molested before they died. <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Orrison </PERSON> said autopsies gave no indication of sexual molestation. He said high levels of carbon monoxide found in the children's blood confirmed earlier speculation that the victims were alive at the time the fire started, and died of smoke inhalation.

 Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, which adjoin each other in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>, are the first to resume a policy of letting some lightning fires burn themselves out, officials said Monday.

 Eight hunger strikers protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said Monday they had ended the fast they began Thanksgiving Day at the Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>. `` The hunger strike was something that just a few people could participate in,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, a Salvadoran refugee leading the protest. `` By ending the hunger strike, we are allowing everybody to participate with us in fighting to stop military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> also said the group was persuaded partly by pleas from Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn. Doctors had said the strikers were entering a critical period that would greatly stress their systems On Sunday, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> attended a nondemoninational prayer vigil at the church that drew more than 3,000 participants, organizers said. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the fast should be suspended until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts on the issue. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> said the strikers' strengths were needed to continue working toward resolving the issue. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had called the strikers Friday, urging them to end their fast, and promised that military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> would be a major issue when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes next month. The hunger strikers included three refugees from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Another is from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, one is from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and three are from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including a Maryknoll priest. Their water-only fast began shortly after the murder of six Jesuit priests in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last month. The fasters had said they would die in the cathedral unless their demands were met. But in a joint statement Monday, the eight said they `` have seen a serious response from political and religious leaders, along with a tremendous outpouring of support from Minnesotans and others throughout the country.'' `` The voiceless are making their voices heard,'' they said. Church officials had said the strikers could remain in the cathedral as long as other church services and activities were not disrupted.

<TEXT>
 Q: Mr. President ... In your inaugural address, you called for a higher level of cooperation between the Executive and Legislative branches. And I was wondering, in the past year _ I realize the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership had some unexpected turmoil _ but have you been pleased, distressed, surprised by the character of White House-Capitol Hill relations? A: Well, being somewhat of a realist, I ca n't say I was surprised, but _ and there have been some negative, highly partisan comments. I pride myself on the fact that I do n't believe anybody can point to a personal observation on the negative side by me about any of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, and I'm going to continue that way. And I try to debrief them when we come back from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>; I try to give them a preview and ask for their advice before I go to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>; we talk about these domestic issues in a very open way with the leaders _ and I'm going to continue that. And I think in some ways, that's been good _ I've taken some flack on board from some in our own party for doing that too much, for trying to work with the Democrats. But I was elected to make certain things happen, and I'm going to continue to try to make certain things happen. I cited an unfulfilled agenda here. But I _ if I had to sum up my feelings at the end of the year, I'd say there are some frustrations, but I'm determined, when the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes back, to hold out the hand and try again. We have good relationships with the Speaker, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side, reasonably good. And so, we're going _ we're going to keep working on that. But it _ there've been some good moments and there've been some enormous frustrations, I guess is the way to wrap it up. Yes, sir? Q: Mr. President ... How likely is it for <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> to receive a fair trial in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, given the breakdown of law and order in that country, and also given the initial remarks that came out of the White House when she was arrested? A: Well, I think it's essential that she receive a fair trial. And I have instructed our ambassador, and indeed talked to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> personally, to represent to the Salvadorans that it's essential that a fair trial be granted And having said that, I am satisfied so far that that will take place. But it is essential that it not only take place but that it have all the appearances of fairness, and I think that's what Mr. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is determined to do. So I do n't _ that one is _ is _ is very complex, but so far I've seen no indication that she will not receive a fair trial. I have expressed my own concern about the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> shooting up civilians and shooting up _ going after a democratically-elected government that was elected in certifiably free elections. And I think when <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> calls and urges that the Soviets intervene to see that this kind of thing does n't go on, it makes an impression on me. But we ought to separate these cases, and just do everything we can to insist that, whoever it is, be granted a fair _ fair hearing and a fair trial. And I hope that will be the case in <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>. Yes, sir? Q: ... <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> being the home of <ORGANIZATION> Marvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, we've got quite an interest in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis. You mentioned in your remarks that you saw the fact that the S & amp; L package guaranteed depositors their money as being a positive. However, some are suggesting that the fact that that maximum level of insurance is so high it's part of the problem, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that. A: On deposit insurance? Q: The maximium level of insurance, $ 100,000 on depositors insurance, being part of the reason for some of the problems with <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and so forth. A: I _ I just _ I do n't want to dodge your question, but I do n't know enough about the specifics in that case to give you an opinion as to whether the $ 100,000 limit on savings deposits affected it or not All I do know is we've got to clean it up and it's a whale of a _ a whale of a mess, and we'll see where we go. But we had this one refinancing. I am now told that that might not be enough. And whether you can attribute it to your question or now, I am embarrassed to say I just do n't have a good answer for you. Yes, sir, way in the back.

 A man charged with murdering 27 people in a bus crash had n't been drinking heavily the day of the accident, relatives and a friend testified Monday as the defense opened its case. Also testifying was <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fire Marshal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who said a smoky fire that engulfed the church bus still would have occurred if the vehicle had been equipped with a protective cage around its gas tank. The defense maintains that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was not drunk when his pickup slammed into the bus on May 14, 1988, and that the 27 victims were killed because the bus was unsafe. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> admits drinking the day of the crash, driving on the wrong side of Interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus. He is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving. Defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> if a protective cage around the gas tank might have prevented the fire that followed the crash. Police say the gas tank was punctured by a piece of the bus' front suspension after the collision. `` It's my opinion it would not have prevented the puncture in this case,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The fire marshal also testified that plastic seat covers and cushions in the bus were combustible, but later added that the smoke that filled the bus might have come from the burning gasoline alone. The former school bus, built in 1977 before more stringent federal safety standards went into effect, had been sold as surplus to the First Assembly of God church. Following the crash, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> issued a report recommending that new school buses be designed with diesel engines, additional emergency escape doors and windows, and with gas tanks in the center, rather than on the side. The defendant's mother, son and best friend followed <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to the witness stand, all testifying that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was not drunk when they saw him the day of the accident, which occurred just before 11 p.m. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 17, testified that he did n't see his father drink, nor did he seem intoxicated when he left their trailer at about 1 p.m. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said her son was n't drunk, and did n't consume any alcohol, when he visited her at about 4:30 p.m. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s best friend, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mefford </PERSON>, testified that he thought <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> had been drinking but was not intoxicated when he visited <PERSON> Mefford </PERSON>'s house at about 6:30 p.m. <PERSON> Mefford </PERSON> described <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> as a moderate drinker who finds that hard liquor bothers his stomach. He said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> drank one can of beer while eating pizza, and then left with another can. The defense is expected to complete its phase of the trial by Friday. It remained uncertain whether <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> would testify.

<TEXT>
 Students have turned the tables on the secret police and are keeping 24-hour watch on state security headquarters. Three students hovered close to the entrance of the police headquarters on <LOCATION> Bartolomejska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> on Monday, serving their time on the front lines in a psychological war against the despised security force. For decades the shadowy force, known as the <ORGANIZATION> STB </ORGANIZATION>, threatened, blackmailed and used every means imaginable to control and silence citizens. A network of vicious spies and informers, the <ORGANIZATION> STB </ORGANIZATION> wove a web of phone taps and bugs and cameras set up on street corners throughout <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. But everything in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has suddenly been turned upside down, and those who not long ago were behind bars as dissidents are now leading the nation as ministers. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, two former dissidents, on Sunday became members of the cabinet and <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> joined a three-man commission overseeing the police. Once interrogated, they now will have some questions of their own. Student leaders warn that when the locked drawers are finally opened, thousands of incriminating files may be missing. In the Moravian town of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, students began keeping an eye on police Friday after accusing them of burning documents in a nearby forest, a charge reported by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. `` To say openly what they may be trying to do is the greatest danger to a group that operates in secrecy,'' said student spokeswoman <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajerova </PERSON>. `` Every citizen will be watching. `` The surveillance in <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION> and here is part of the pressure we want to put on to keep the secret police under control,'' she said. But the police plead innocence. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitcanek </PERSON>, chief of uniformed police for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, denied in an interview with Western reporters that any documents have been removed from his office. Trouble is, Bitcanek only took the job four days ago. His predecessor abruptly found a new career. Bitcanek voluteered to interview in place of the head of secret police. He said he did not know who was now head of the furtive force since the former chief was removed last week. He confessed that morale among his comrades has hit a new low and that the force is in shambles. `` You have to realize that this is a corps set up along military lines and that right now we are not receiving any orders,'' he said, while chanting from a small street demonstration drifted through his office window. <PERSON> Bitcanek </PERSON> said police, especially secret police, were only following orders from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy. Now they're being held responsible `` I went down to talk to the students when they came on Friday. They photographed me,'' <PERSON> Bitcanek </PERSON> complained. `` They were taking pictures of every person who came in or out of our building.'' `` I asked them to stop. I do n't havu any guarantee that a picture of a policeman in this emotionally charged, psychotic atmosphere will not be used against the agent or his family,'' he said. The police, who are estimated to number over 100,000, are just the latest security force to come under citizen attack. On Dec. 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> disarmed its paramilitary force, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>. On Dec. 7, Defense Minister <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON> gave his assurance to opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclev </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> that the army, estimated by Western experts at 145,000, would never be used against the citizens. Despite such assurances, many Czechoslovaks suffer the psychic scars of the last 40 years and are finding it hard to shed their fears. They remember philosopher <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Patocka </PERSON>, the guiding spirit of the human rights group Charter 77, who died after eight hours of police interrogation 12 years ago. `` We are still nervous,'' said a 32-year-old writer who requested he not be identified. `` Maybe we are demanding too much too fast. Will the secret police stand for this?'' A student in front of the station on Monday said they did n't have any choice: `` Now it's not the Soviets, it is the people who are here.

 The first person to undergo a simultaneous heart, liver and kidney transplant was placed back on a ventilator after she developed a pancreas inflammation, hospital officials said Monday. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Archbald </LOCATION> was in critical condition Monday at <LOCATION> Presbyterian-University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Q: ... It sometime seems that missing from your agenda _ I mean from your comments today _ has been anything relating to the problems of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, particularly the problems of urban poverty. And it leads to an inclination to think that perhaps you do n't think these problems are amenable to a federal initiative. Is that correct? A: No, that's incorrect. I though child care had a lot to do with that. I thought the question of anti-crime legislation has a lot to do with that, because those areas are the most severely impacted, but I'm glad you raised it because it is totally incorrect. Yes, sir. ... I also mentioned the creation of jobs. That's very important to the inner cities. Yeah, go ahead. Q: ... As we await your next budget for next year, there is some anxiety that there may be another round of cuts in human and domestic services, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, where you recently offered a recess appointment for a new chairman. Can you give us some assurances that the kinder, gentler administration will have adequate funding for human services? A: I think you'll _ I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you take the overall budget and its concerns for city affairs, for human affairs, whatever _ Q: -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- A: Well, I ca n't _ I do n't know the exact levels on Legal Services. We're in the final processes of budget right now. I go from this meeting to another marvelous meeting with <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ and big, thick notebooks over there, so I am not ducking it, I just do n't know the answer. But generally speaking, I think you're going to find that we are able to finance the initiatives that I talked about _ some of which I mentioned here _ that do affect the human _ the welfare of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, particularly those that are disadvantaged. Yeah? ... Last two. One, two. Q: ... Mr. President. Could you tell us when a decision will be announced on the relocation of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? A: No, sir, I do n't know _ I'm not ducking it, I just do n't know the answer. -LRB- Aside -RRB- Does anyone _ can anyone help with that? <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>? Staff: No, sir. A: Ca n't _ I know people in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> have a keen interest in this _ Q: Yes, very keen. A: _ and I can understand why, but I just do n't know the answer to that one. Yes, last one. Q: ... There have been widely divergent accounts this morning of the credibility of a witness to the murder of those priests in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Is it not time to go public with that investigation? And if not now, when? A: A widening _ a widely _ Q: We have a report _ A: _ as to whether she's a credible witness or not? Q: Yes, we have a report out of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that she had flunked lie detector tests. We have other reports from the clergy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that she's being brainwashed. Could you respond to that? A: Yeah, I can respond to the last part of it, and _ because when I read that, I looked into that and I am _ and I am assured that is not the case. But I think you're _ you ask a good question as to when all this will become public; it should be, and I'd like to see it as soon as possible. But there are some _ I think there are some concerns and all I would say is that this _ she was accompanied by a person from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. I believe the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has had a _ had the custodianship or taken a keen interest in all of this, and I have confidence that our Attorney General would not permit the kind of inquisition process that was alluded to in the papers today. And so it is very important, just as in the Casolo case, that this be resolved fairly and to the satisfaction of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. And that is going to mean the disclosure that you're _ that you're asking about. And so I want to _ I want to just assure you that this will _ this will take place. I think it's important that it's done in a way so there's no _ you know _ not tampering with evidence, but prejudicing the legal proceedings that are taking place. I think that's very important. Q: Well, will you order the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to make its investigation public in the reasonably near future? A: Well, I'll do it in _ within the confines of the legal proceedings. I do n't want to _ I do n't want to order them to do something and then have them say the very fact you've done this is making it difficult to get a reasonable solution to the question everybody is asking: What happened? But I think in fairness to her, I've already guaranteed to my satisfaction that she is not being mishandled. And I do n't think that people would tell me something that's not true there because there would be a price to pay for that. Thank you all very much. Thank you.

<TEXT>
 A two-hour general strike called by human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> appeared to fizzle Monday, with only about 1,500 participants reported in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and scattered support around the country. Scientists at research institutes were the main workers in the capital to heed the strike call to demand an end to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> domination, an aide to the Nobel Peace Prize laureate said. There was little exact information about strikes elsewhere, but <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobyanin </PERSON> said his office received about 100 telegrams from Soviet workplaces where walkouts took place and knew of about 1,500 scientists who took part. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of Pravda, said the strike apparently `` did n't happen.'' `` I think it would be hard to imagine that in these conditions, after all we've lived through and are living through, that this poorly thought-out strike call could meet understanding among the public,'' he told a news conference at the party newspaper's offices Strikes have ravaged the struggling economy since summer, and officials now warn that city-supplied steam heat could be affected by a coal strike in an already bitter <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> winter. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and other parliamentarians called for the strike to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to vote on rescinding Article 6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Communists the `` leading and guiding role'' in society. They also want the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which opens Tuesday, to act on several key reform laws. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s move failed to win the support of a group of 400 progressive parliamentarians. The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> voted Sunday to favor the goal of rescinding Communist supremacy, but did not throw its influence behind the call for a general strike. Members said the public mood was too explosive. Random checks of factories in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bore out <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>'s claim that the strike failed to materialize. <PERSON> Sobyanin </PERSON> said despite the limited participation in the walkout, a permanent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> strike committee was being formed in case the need arose for a walkout. A highly successful two-hour strike Nov. 27 preceded <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s recent decision to drop its version of Article 6 from its constitution, and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have done away with their equivalents of the clause as one after the other moved away from Communist one-party rule. In the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, some store clerks and transport workers called a halt for just 15 minutes to show their solidarity with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s call, said <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> <PERSON> Melans </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Atmoda </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s popular front, called <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, saw no reason to strike since its parliament voted last week to drop its version of Article 6 and legalize a multiparty system, said spokesman <PERSON> Gintautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alyksenes </PERSON>. As a sign of solidarity with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s call, however, <PERSON> Sajudis </PERSON> called for a minute of silence, he said. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> decided not to join the strike, even for two hours, because `` we have such terrible economic conditions, it would make people's lives worse,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepp </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s parliament is expected to follow <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s example, throwing out its version of Article 6 and legalizing multiple political parties within a month, <PERSON> Lepp </PERSON> said. `` For all practical purposes, it's already removed,'' he said. Although only the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION> called itself a political party in Sunday's elections, many other political movements fielded candidates, <PERSON> Lepp </PERSON> said. Soviet TV's nightly news program, `` Vremya,'' like other Soviet media, carried nothing Monday on the strike.

<TEXT>
 Military officials said Monday that hundreds of soldiers who launched the failed coup attempt are still at large, and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> called for tougher search and arrest measures. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> also said her government's position in talks on a new lease for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases has not been compromised by the role <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes played in helping put down the rebellion that officials say killed 113 people. Military officials said they can not account for more than half of the soldiers who launched the coup attempt Dec. 1 in the most serious bid by troops to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Rebels in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> surrendered their last known position to government forces Saturday. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON>, chief of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said 1,485 rebel troops, including 128 officers, have surrendered. The military estimates about 3,000 soldiers joined the coup attempt, and the whereabouts of many rebels remained unclear. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said in addition to 113 deaths, the coup attempt left 581 people wounded. On Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a nationwide state of emergency to cope with the crisis. She said Monday she wanted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to grant special powers to search for weapons and ammunition without the normal legal constraints. She also said the administration would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend to 72 hours the length of time a suspect can be detained without charge. The law requires that suspects be charged within 12 to 36 hours of arrest, depending on the severity of the crime. As a sign of concern, share prices tumbled 8 percent in nervous trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, the first day of trading since the coup attempt was launched. At a news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was asked whether she was considering a Cabinet shakeup after the coup attempt. `` I believe that by the end of the year we will already know who we will probably change,'' she said. Mutineers had demanded that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her government resign in favor of a civilian-military junta. Many political commentators also have urged changes in the Cabinet because of inefficiency in government. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the bases issue was not discussed when her government asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, through Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, to provide air cover for loyal forces. On Dec. 1, the first day of the coup attempt, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom jets based in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> provided air cover for loyal troops fighting rebel forces who bombed the <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION> presidential palace and occupied three military bases. The talks on the future of the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, whose lease expires in 1991, were set to begin this month but are expected to start in January or February, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said at a separate news conference that the flights by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes could have a positive effect on the talks. He said the jets did not fire on rebel positions as claimed by opposition politicians. `` In my view, the forthcoming exploratory talks between two governments would be affected in a positive way by that giving of assistance in a very well-defined manner _ nobody went out of bounds,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said. Also on Monday, opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> can not prove she was elected president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and should resign. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the former defense minister, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` has no evidence that she is the duly elected president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. ... If there is anybody who should lead the resignation of national officials of the land, it should be Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>'s claim reflects the opinion of a clique of military officers who triggered the February 1986 `` people power'' revolution against then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> but who then turned against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and have tried to overthrow her. The 1986 uprising began after <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and military allies mutinied against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> following a fraud-tainted presidential election. No independent vote count was ever completed. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said he would refuse to cooperate with a presidential commission investigating whether he took part in the latest coup attempt. He has denied involvement. He was fired as defense minister on Nov. 26, 1986, after a failed coup by his followers.

 Homelessness, AIDS and crack cocaine are overwhelming child welfare services nationwide and are contributing to a growing number of children in foster care, a congressional report said Monday. The report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> said federal funding for major children's services, especially those designed to keep children in their homes, has not kept pace with the problem. `` This is <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s legacy to the 1990s,'' Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., committee chairman, said at a news conference `` This was the prescription for the 1980s and it's been a complete disaster.'' Social workers can not keep up with huge caseloads, and children are being placed on waiting lists rather than given services, he said. `` It means we are devastating hundreds of thousands of children ... These children are becoming candidates for long-term dependency on our social welfare system,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We're really talking here about he candidates' school for future penetentiary residents.'' The report estimates that the number of children placed in foster care, juvenile detention centers and mental health facilities has grown to nearly 500,000 and could reach 840,000 by 1995. The report said its survey of 11 large states showed the number of children in foster care dropped by 9 percent between 1980 and 1985. However, the number rose 23 percent between 1985 and 1988, while federal funding for child welfare services aimed at keeping children in their homes rose 7 percent, according to the report. The number of children in public and private juvenile detention centers rose 27 percent from 1979 to 1987, as funding under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act declined from $ 100 million in fiscal 1979 to $ 66.7 million in fiscal 1989, the report said. The number of children in mental health facilities soared 60 percent between 1983 and 1986, the report said. Federal block grants for mental health services provided $ 503 million to the states in fiscal 1989, $ 17 million less than the sum of programs consolidated into block grants in 1981, it said. The states surveyed were <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Among the reasons cited for the increases in foster placements and detentions was drug and alcohol abuse. The number of babies born `` drug-exposed'' reached 375,000 in 1988, a number that has quadrupled in the last three years, the report said. It also said reports of abused or neglected children rose 82 percent to 2.2 million between 1981 and 1988. Also, requests for shelter for homeless families rose 18 percent from 1987 to 1988, said the report, citing a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> report. Republicans on the committee disputed the Democrats' projection that out-of-home placements for children will jump 73 percent over the next five years. They took issue with the report's methods of calculating the projection and basing it on an 11-state survey. `` Our concern is that the numbers are so unreliable that the message will be dismissed,'' their statement said. The dissenters said more nationwide information is needed on adoption and foster care, and they blamed the states for some of the problems in the system. Four different <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reports have shown states have failed to implement procedures and protections established by the federal government to protect children, they said.

 Three Christian militiamen were wounded in a shootout with Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops on a highway Monday, sending commuters fleeing for cover and underscoring growing friction between Christian forces. Police said the three wounded men belonged to <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s 6,000-member Lebanese Forces, which favors an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war A quarrel developed over traffic rights in the afternoon rush hour, police said. A Lebanese Forces jeep tried to overtake an army patrol at the <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> intersection of the main coastal highway in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Militiamen in the jeep opened up with submachine guns at the patrol. The soldiers retaliated by tossing a hand grenade that blew up the jeep,'' said a police spokesman who can not be identified under standing rules. Hundreds of motorists in the bumper-to-bumper traffic panicked. Many crashed into others' cars and then leaped out to duck for cover, leaving their doors ajar, the spokesman said. It took traffic police half an hour to remove the three victims to hospital and restore order on the highway, the spokesman added. `` The incident appeared spontaneous, but the underlying tension between the two sides is unmistakable,'' the spokesman said. The Lebanese Forces and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army have been on a collision course since the general rejected the Arab peace plan under which a new president, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, was elected Nov. 24. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the plan for not specifying when Syrian troops would leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> has fired <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from all his posts. But the general is holding out with 20,000 loyal troops in the presidential palace, located in the Christian enclave. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> are all Maronites, the Christian sect that has dominated power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since it gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s presidency, calling him a `` Syrian puppet'' because he was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in an area controlled by the Syrian army in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians moved in reinforcements two weeks ago and have threatened to evict <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> by force from the <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> place, five miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But tens of thousands of supporters have since formed a human wall around the hilltop palace in a massive display of pro-Aoun sentiment in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> has declared his militia would fight alongside <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army if the enclave was attacked by the Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> But <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> also made it plain in televised speeches to his supporters that he recognizes <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s legitimacy, always referring to him as `` President <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Grand Jury Epected To Review 1963 Slaying Of Civil Rights Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A grand jury that convened Monday is expected to make a preliminary examination of evidence in the 1963 slaying of civil rights leader <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>. However, <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> has said he expects no indictment by this grand jury in the Evers slaying. Prosecutors say they are continuing to investigate the killing and could present more evidence to a later grand jury. `` In fact that is probably what is going to happen,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON>. `` All we wanted to do with this grand jury is advise them what has happened. It does n't mean we are quitting We have to start somewhere, sometime, and this is it.'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, field director of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death June 12, 1963, outside his <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home. White supremacist <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> fertilizer salesman, was tried twice in <ORGANIZATION> Hinds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1964. Two all-white juries were unable to reach verdicts and the charge was dropped. Newspaper reports on Oct. 1 said he state's defunct segregation spy agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, had screened potential jurors for <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s second trial to aid the defense. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> now lives in a suburb of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The reports raised questions about jury tampering. However, <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, who served as executive director of the commission during the time of <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s trials, insisted that there was no tampering. Representatives of the district attorney's office have since talked to all but one or two of the jurors from the second trial. <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> would not say what the jurors said. <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> and two investigators have examined records and conducted interviews in the Evers case. `` For right now we have been focused on the second trial,'' <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said. `` There were no allegations concerning the first trial.'' The grand jury that convened Monday is expected to meet through most of the week. Prosecutors declined to say when the Evers matter might be discussed. The panel's proceedings will not be open to the public. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON>, met privately Friday with <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> for an hour-long briefing. She said she was not asked to testify before the grand jury on her husband's slaying. `` I can not tell you ... if I am satisfied with the actions of that office because I have not seen enough,'' she said. `` I would simply hope that as the investigation goes on, whatever happens, that justice be done ... that there will be enough evidence to convict,'' Ms. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday denied allegations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had mistreated a Salvadoran witness who had implicated the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the slayings of six Jesuit priests last month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he had told President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that a fair trail must be held for <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> church worker arrested after ammunition and explosives were found buried in her yard in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Salvadoran Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> y <ORGANIZATION> Damas </ORGANIZATION> had said on Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had resorted to `` psychological torment'' and brainwashing in an effort to induce the woman, <PERSON> Luisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>, to retract her story. A lawyer for an association of American Jesuits, <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Greathead </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON> withdrew her statement implicating the Army under pressure from her American and Salvadoran interrogators. Ms. <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>, a housekeeper for the Jesuits, first said she saw armed men dressed in military uniform enter the rectory of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 16, when the Jesuits were killed. She was flown to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Nov. 23 at her request and that of the Spanish and French ambassadors in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. During a question-and-answer session with newspaper editors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he checked into news accounts of the case and was assured Ms. <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON> had not been mistreated. `` And I do n't think that people would tell me something that's not true there because there would be a price to pay for that,'' he said `` I have confidence that our Attorney General would not permit the kind of inquisition process that was alluded to in the papers today.'' Some of those accounts said Ms. <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON> had failed lie detector tests. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that he expects that details of the case will be released so long as they do not jeopardize the legal proceedings now under way. On the Casolo case, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` So far I have no received any indictation that she will not receive a fair trial.'' Some presidential spokesmen have suggested that the <LOCATION> Salvadorqan </LOCATION> government had a case against the woman in view of the large quantity of munitions dug up around her house on Nov. 26. Some congressional Democrats have criticized those comments. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention those exchanges. He said he had spoken to both <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, `` to represent to the Salvadorans that it's essential that a fair trial be granted,'' and be seen to be fair. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s associates and family insist she has been framed. She is being held for 90 days during an investigation. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> denied the allegations that Ms. <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON> had been forced to recant `` absolutely and unequivocally.'' He said there have been `` many misinformed and unsubstantiated statements'' that have served to suggest that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government wants to discredit the witness's testimony `` Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said it appears the archbishop had not been given the facts of the case, adding that the administration has a deep commitment to uncover the truth. `` We are doing everything possible to help the Salvadorans find the killers and bring them to justice,'' he said. `` We expect this case to be investigated fully and promptly, and that those implicated by the investigation will be prosecuted. We have made this entirely clear to President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and to the armed forces.'' He said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official witnessed all the interviews, which were carried out by a U.S.-trained Salvadoran special investigative unit and by agents of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. At the conclusion of Ms. <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>'s questioning, she was turned over to the Jesuits. During the time she was under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government protection, the church was given free access to her and never mentioned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials any allegation of mistreatment, he said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> sent a letter to Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> expressing concern over reports of systematic mistreatment of American religious workers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He asked <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to give his personal attention to the welfare of these workers. There have been reports that one such worker, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON>, was tortured recently by Salvadoran police. A group of religious leaders said two weeks ago the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has not been aggressive enough in preventing Salvadoran officials from engaging in the reported abuses.

<HEAD>Iranian Urges Release of Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOHA, Qatar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has urged its `` friends'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to free the Western hostages, a senior Iranian official said in an interview published Monday. `` We have directed our advice to our friends in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to cease their acts with respect to the kidnapping of the Western hostages,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Raya </ORGANIZATION> quoted Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> as saying. `` But the problem is that every time the atmosphere becomes propitious for the release of the hostages, there are counterincidents that cloud the atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, who ended a two-day visit to this Persian Gulf nation on Sunday. The paper said he was referring to the kidnapping by Israeli commandos of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem preacher from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, on July 28. On July 31, Shiite Moslem kidnappers of the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said they killed their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation for the kidnapping. Most of the 18 hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed to be in the hands of Iranian-backed Shiite groups. They are eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985 in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and the election of the more pragmatic President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> gave rise to some hopes of Iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives. Before coming to <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> as part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s active contacts with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member states ahead of their annual summit Dec. 18 in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> make up the council, which generally supports the policies of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s long-time enemy. Relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the council states, with the exception of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, have been steadily improving since Persian <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire to the eight-year war with <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 The captain of the USS Iowa said Monday that he does n't `` agree or disagree'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> likely caused an explosion that left 47 sailors dead, but he did say he thought the ship had been sabotaged. `` I embraced that it was an intentional act,'' Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told reporters after his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can not make the jump that it was absolutely Petty Officer <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. ... I do n't think I can say that a definite individual did it. He was a good gunner's mate.'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, testifying publicly for the first time since the April 19 blast in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, also softened previous statements _ made under oath to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators _ that were sharply critical of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crew's gun-firing capabilities. With <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s mother and sister sitting nearby, he told the committee, `` I do n't agree or disagree'' with the finding that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was responsible for the explosion in the No. 2 gun turret. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, however, said he thought the ship had been sabotaged because he did n't believe there could be any other explanation. He was not testifying under oath Monday. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have questioned the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s official findings. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in a Sept. 7 report, concluded that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial because all the witnesses, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, were killed in the blast. The service said the case against <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was built largely on circumstantial evidence drawn from forensic tests and a psychological profile depicting him as a suicidal loner. Three <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> psychologists testified that they believed <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> committed suicide, even though the agency's review of laboratory tests proved inconclusive. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Criminal Investigative Analysis Program said there had been nothing in <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> files to show that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had been `` a happy camper.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Ault </ORGANIZATION> said the bureau had no conclusive evidence that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> blew up the turret. Committee Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and other members interrogated <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> closely on whether he shared the conclusions of the naval investigative commission headed by Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> `` You agree that it was a wrongful, intentional act?'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> asked. `` That's correct,'' the captain replied, `` ... based on my observations on the procedures up there of loading that gun, and that's the only conclusion I can come to.'' But <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> refused to agree with Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s statement that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report blaming <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was `` highly speculative.'' `` I would n't make that statement,'' he said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., shot back that `` it strains the intelligence of most people'' to conclude that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had sufficient evidence to hold <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> accountable for the explosion <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> if he thought the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was engaging in a cover-up. `` I hope that's not the case,'' he replied. `` I do n't believe it is the case.'' <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, the sailor's mother, walked up to <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> after his testimony and asked him if he thought her son had caused the explosion. `` I looked him straight in the eye and asked him,'' she told reporters later. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s mother: `` He was a good gunner's mate. Did I say your son did it? I did n't say that.'' He kissed Mrs. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, also was critical of <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>'s testimony. `` I think somebody has gotten to him,'' she said. `` If he does n't think my brother did it, who does he believe did it?'' When pressed during the hearing to say why he could not share the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said it was because he put out to sea shortly after the incident and had no access to the evidence. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> did acknowledge that his weapons department personnel proceeded April 19 with an unauthorized firing in the No. 2 gun turret involving five powder bags rather than the customary six. The initial explosion was caused by premature ignition of five bags of smokeless powder contained within the center gun with the breech dless to say, I open. `` Neewas disappointed in my subordinates for pre-empting my command prerogative,'' he said, noting that they had been punished. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, also officially reprimanded after the incident, steadfastly denied that the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had become what <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> called a `` floating laboratory.'' He said the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> resumed normal firings within weeks of the explosion. `` I would not have ordered my men in there and I would not have gone into the turret if I thought this thing could have happened again,'' he said. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>'s commission he was concerned about the capabilities of key <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crew members. He called a gunnery officer `` a basket case'' and said that a chief petty officer had to be `` kept in a box'' because of a $ 1.5793 late Friday. The pound fetched $ 1.5937 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.5825. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.7610 West German marks, down from 1.7705; 1.5915 Swiss francs, down from 1.5970; 6.0200 French francs, down from 6.0485; 1,301.00 Italian lire, down from 1,304.00; and 1.16375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16225 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Friday: 1.7660 West German marks, down from 1.7720; 1.5970 Swiss francs, down from 1.5985; 6.0370 French francs, down from 6.0565; 1.9950 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0000; 1,304.25 Italian lire, down from 1,306.50; and 1.1632 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1615. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold rose to a late bid of $ 416.75 an ounce from $ 411.55 Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it jumped to $ 415.75 an ounce from $ 409.25.

<HEAD>US Urges Support For Yugoslav Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern Monday about rising tensions in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and urged the people to unite in support of the reform efforts of Prime Minister Ante <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>. `` Mutual respect, adherence to democratic principles, and a commitment to avoiding violence are crucial to resolving this situation,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. Tensions among <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s loose federation of six republics were exacerbated Monday when the leadership of the Communist country's second-largest state _ <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> _ called for the establishment of a multiparty system. Until now the liberal northern state of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> was the only one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics to openly advocate the introduction of Western-style democracy.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> proposed Monday that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, a fortress of Stalinism only weeks ago, hold free elections in May and remove the party's guarantee of exclusive power from the constitution. While the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> heard <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> court registered Eco-Glasnost, an ecological group, as <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s first independent organization. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> said a new constitution should be drafted by the end of next year, leaving out any guarantee of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> power. `` One can not postulate the role of party in a democratic society or define it on command,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` This role can only be -LRB- won -RRB- as a result of the people's trust.'' Party activities `` must be in harmony with the Constitution and its laws,'' <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> said. `` We have to take practical steps to separate the functions of the state and the party.'' He recommended passage of a new electoral law and new rules `` on gatherings, meetings and demonstrations, citizen's organizations -LRB- and -RRB- religion.'' Early elections are likely to favor the Communists. The growing number of still-unregistered political, religious and ecological groups were banned until recently and have had little time to establish themselves. In a 90-minute speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> distributed by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> said a special party congress should be held March 26, state radio reported. The next regular congress originally was scheduled for early 1991 but, then moved up to late 1990. After the May elections, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> should `` pass the most important legislation on economic reform, including the law over property and the law on land and use of land by the end of 1990.'' He said he favored a `` socialist market economy,'' implying some state ownership. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, party chief for 35 years, on Nov. 10. As the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met Monday evening, thousands of people with candles kept a silent vigil outside party headquarters. At least 10,000 gathered in the square behind the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building, and organizers said it was to show party leaders the people were watching their decisions. About 5,000 people had gathered in the square earlier Monday, dispersing peacefully after an hour. Two more vigils are planned Tuesday. More than 50,000 people rallied in downtown <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> on Sunday, demanding the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resign and the party give up its constitutional monopoly on power, as in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The rallies reflected a growing popular demand for the kind of reform taking place elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s staunchest allies, but <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> did little to implement change after <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorabchev </PERSON> began promoting more liberal policies. Since <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s downfall, the official media have become more open, people have been able to demonstrate without police interference for the first time in more than 40 years, and independent groups have been allowed to function. At Monday's evening vigil, a woman caught up in an emotional debate said Bulgarians were willing to stand there around the clock until the leadership acted on reform. She and others said they believed <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>'s promises of change, but wanted a democracy anchored in law. `` Democracy and socialism are not compatible,'' she declared. An old man spoke of change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, then said: `` We are a bit late, but we will catch up because we are persistent.'' State radio quoted <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, formerly foreign minister, as telling the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he favored broad dialogue with all `` who support a state of law in the framework of socialism.'' An overwhelming show of hands at Sunday's rally approved a resolution sponsored by 19 unofficial groups demanding abolition of the constitution's first paragraph, which enshrines the leading party role in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> has described the power monopoly as open to question and <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, his No. 2 man, said last week the party could not claim such an exclusive right. The party daily, <PERSON> Rabotnichesko </PERSON> <PERSON> Delo </PERSON>, already had reported calls for an early congress, the only party forum that can elect a new Central Committee. It said more than 4,000 letters and telephone calls demanding reforms had been received since <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was dismissed. An opinion poll ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and published by the paper said only 23 percent of those responding expressed great trust in the party and only 32 percent indicated trust in any political organization. <PERSON> Rabotnichesko </PERSON> <PERSON> Delo </PERSON> said 1,513 people were questioned Nov. 28 in 127 work collectives. It concluded little trust existed because official organizations, including the party, had `` discredited themselves in the eyes of the people'' and independent groups had not been tested. The party paper said one-third of those polled said they wanted a multiparty political system, 68.9 percent supported a system based on law and 77.7 percent said economic reform was imperative.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday he has asked Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to ensure that a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman arrested on suspicion of storing arms for rebel forces receive a fair trial. In his first public remarks about the Nov. 26 arrest in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said all indications are that <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> will be treated fairly. `` I think it's essential that she receive a fair trial,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a White House news conference. `` So far I have not received any indication that she will not receive a fair trial.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration came under sharp criticism from congressional Democrats after presidential spokesmen made comments indicating that the Salvadoran government had a case against <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention of the criticism. He said nothing indicating that the government is seeking amnesty for Casolo or considers her innocent. `` I have instructed our ambassador, -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> -RRB- and indeed talked to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> personally, to represent to the Salvadorans that it's essential that a fair trial be granted,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I am satisfied so far that that will take place,'' he added. `` But it is essential that it not only take place but that it have all the appearances of fairness, and I think that's what Mr. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is determined to do.'' Casolo, a 28-year-old resident of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1985 to work for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, a group dedicated to influencing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy by organizing tours for Americans to learn about the 10-year-old civil war. She and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 after a police raid on her white stucco house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. From the walled garden behind the house, police said they uncovered 103 mortar grenades, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-made automatic rifles. Casolo was ordered held Friday for 90 days while an investigation continues into possible links between her, the explosives and Salvadoran rebel forces. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s friends and family insist she is innocent, the victim of a setup. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attended a service Sunday in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> attended by <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s parents and friends during which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying it was `` sad'' that the president `` will not argue <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s case.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., among those to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his handling of the Casolo case, arranged for former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> to represent <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> Salvadoran law prevents <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> from actually defending <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> in court. A Salvadoran attorney will represent her at trial while <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> serves as a legal advisor.

<TEXT>
 Preliminary results of weekend local elections in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> show the grassroots <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> gaining over half the vote in most regions and winning landslides in the countryside, an activist said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which favors independence for the small <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, is now expected to win about 60 percent overall and 80 percent of the rural vote in the final count, said member <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozenvalds </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, where elections also were held Sunday for seats in local councils, results were not expected for several days, but polls have indicated environmentalists were likely to receive half the vote there. The elections were the first in a series of local votes to be held in the coming months in all 15 republics as part of the Soviet transition to multicandidate races and greater democracy. They are considered critical for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms because it is the vast numbers of local and regional bureaucrats who are blamed for blocking implementation of his new programs. In the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Arnolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Klautsens </PERSON> received only 40 percent of the vote for a seat in the local council, and <PERSON> Rozenvalds </PERSON> said he was unlikely to win a run-off because a citywide scandal had arisen about ballots faked in his favor. Officials have predicted widespread defeats for Communist leaders in both republics. There were 33,500 candidates running for city council and other regional `` soviets'' in the two republics.

<TEXT>
 As a high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advance team left to prepare for a drug summit in violence-torn <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday he wants to go, despite some aides' misgivings, to avoid sending a signal that traveling there is unsafe. `` Right now I'm very hopeful that the meeting will take place in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of editorial writers at the White House. The administration advance team that left Monday will be pressing for a stronger commitment from the cocaine-producing countries of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> on eradicating their large coca crops, officials said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged the security concerns some officials have raised about taking his entourage to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, but added: `` I do n't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should go to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> if they ca n't be protected.'' He said a final decision has not been made on going to <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, a major center of drug-trafficking operations for the Andes. `` I will listen to the experts. I will not do anything imprudent. Nobody has ever accused me of doing anything too daring. `` But I do n't want to undermine this courageous leader,'' he said of Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. He said he did not want to `` send some signal'' that <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> `` ca n't provide the security for three heads of state visiting his country.'' The administration advance team, headed by Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, left for <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> on Monday to work on an agenda and lay groundwork for the summit. The team will also visit <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to push for greater evidence of commitment on the part of those two countries in the antidrug efforts, said officials. The summit will include Peruvian President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and Bolivian President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> in addition to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Barco. The advance group also will try to coordinate with the other nations on strategy and will discuss future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. Among the items that will be addressed are cooperation on money laundering, sharing intelligence, extradition and crop substitution for the coca fields. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug policy coordinator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said the administration finds <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s antidrug actions and commitment `` exemplary.'' But he told reporters last week that `` the jury is still out'' on <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, both of which receive drug-fighting aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate, but one administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, `` They could be more aggressive.'' Drug Enforcement Administration officials have said that the eradication program in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is still developing and is improving. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly praised <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s efforts in the face of escalating bombings and violence laid to drug lords against civilian and government targets. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s problems revolve mostly around drug-processing activities and smuggling, with the major cocaine cartels operating from there. But <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> have the agricultural fields where large quantities of coca leaves are cultivated for processing into cocaine. `` There is definitely a lot of coca out there that has not been eradicated,'' an administration official said Monday. `` Clearly, people need to get energized and intensify their efforts.'' He also requested anonymity. Officials have said that the extent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the three Andean countries is tied to their performance on the drug efforts. The administration wants to see more emphasis by those governments on economic alternatives for the farmers whose livlihoods would be stripped by eradication of their coca crops, officials said. By law, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must certify each year that countries are cooperating in the war on drugs before they can receive foreign aid. Negligible progress in reducing coca production has been achieved despite spending of more than $ 100 million on the problem over the last 17 years, according to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in July. The department says that coca production has increased every year. Figures provided by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office say <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> produced 249 metric tons of coca in 1988 and <LOCATION> Boliva </LOCATION> 160 metric tons, while <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crop was put at 49 metric tons. Among those accompanying <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> this week are <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Skol </PERSON>, the deputy assistant security of state for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs.

<HEAD>Most Plutonium Managers to be Removed in Nuclear Plant Shakeup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Managers of five of the six plutonium processing buildings at the idled Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant likely will be replaced next month as part of a broad plan for improving safety, officials said Monday. Some details of the plan were spelled out for an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuven </PERSON>, who will be associate general manager for defense programs at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> takes over as plant operator Jan. 1. The current operator, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced in September it was quitting Rocky Flats because of a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over potential criminal liability for past environmental violations. The plant, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and is the nation's only maker of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. A phased halt to Rocky Flats plutonium operations began in mid-November to give EG & amp; G time to develop an improvement plan. The plant has been criticized by government and independent inspectors for a wide variety of shortcomings, including inadequate safeguards against worker exposure to radiation. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuven </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Facility Safety that he would inspect the management of all six plutonium buildings in the next few weeks, and that he would bring five executives from other EG & amp; G-operated facilities to be on `` ready standby'' to replace up to five of the building managers. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuven </PERSON> said he already had determined that five of the six managers, who work for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, are unlikely to meet <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G's managerial standards. `` One has the capabilities I'm looking for, the rest are questionable,'' he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuven </PERSON> said Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G to develop by the third week in January a timetable for restarting Rocky Flats plutonium operations. He declined to speculate on how long the plant would be idled, but said it would not be restarted until all safety-related questions had been answered. `` We'll take however long it takes'' to ensure safe operation, he told a reporter. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, the designated <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G general manager at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel an `` integrated plan'' for running <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> probably would be ready by the end of March. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuven </PERSON> said later that referred to a long-range plan for improving the plant, and that a phased restart of plutonium operations could begin before that plan is ready.

 The brother-in-law of a former <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> president was charged Monday with conspiracy in the slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent as part of a plot to keep a major international drug trafficking cartel in business. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, 59, was to be arraigned later Monday on the new charges linked to the 1985 torture-killing of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, among 13 people charged in connection with <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s death, was charged with conspiracy to commit violent crimes, conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent and committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering If convicted, he faces a maximum of life in prison. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a co-defendant, is charged with the felony murder of a federal agent, among other things. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, a businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, was arrested Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> as he got off a plane arriving from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The agents arresting <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> were part of a task force that was set up in 1985 exclusively to investigate the slayings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his Mexican pilot. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents believed <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to help his attorneys prepare a defense for his federal perjury trial slated to begin this month, said <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> first was arrested Aug. 9 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and escorted to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to testify before the grand jury probing <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s slaying. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, 37, was abducted in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> in February 1985. His severely beaten body and that of his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, were found in a remote area 70 miles north of the city. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> was charged with lying when he told the grand jury he did n't know two alleged Mexican drug kingpins connected to the killings. The businessman owned a house in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> that was sold to reputed drug baron <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> shortly before the slayings. The government alleges <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was tortured and killed in the house. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> was released on $ 200,000 bail on the perjury charge despite a federal prosecutor's contention that he was a flight risk. But he appeared in court in late October for a hearing.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> colleges and universities should develop a `` zero tolerance'' policy and require a course in ethnic relations to improve campus race relations, the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recommended Monday. The recommendations stemmed from the commission's discussions with administrators, students and faculty from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> universities. `` It is our hope that universities will look at these recommendations as a guide and use them to implement a program of this sort on their campus,'' <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> said at a commission meeting. Racial tensions rose on several campuses this year. Sit-ins were held at <ORGANIZATION> Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> State </PERSON> universities. Students demanded racial sensitivity from staff and other students, and policies against individuals who commit racist acts. The `` zero tolerance'' policy would define unlawful and unacceptable acts of racism, and authorize punishments. The ethnic-relations class would be required for all freshman to sensitize individuals to racial issues and concerns. At least seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities already require such a class. An official at one <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> institution said he did n't believe a course would solve the racial problems. `` I believe race relations should be spread around in all courses, not stuffed into one,'' <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Diether </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haenicke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> said some <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> schools already are implementing programs. `` MSU is scheduled to begin its ethnic-relations class in 1992,'' he said. `` We would hope that they would begin earlier than that.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Duderstadt </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that all universities have a responsibility to strive for ethnic diversification because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will become increasingly multicultural in the next century. He said he believes his school has made `` remarkable progress'' in reducing racial tension through minority recruiting. The recommendations also included setting up procedures to process discrimination complaints, developing and distributing a booklet for students on their civil rights, and periodic reviews of campus policies and their success. `` Through a concerted effort, we can develop programs that not only reduce current tension, but also prevent future unlawful acts of harassment from occurring,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Suit to Bar Africa's Tallest Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's highest court Monday dismissed an environmentalist's lawsuit that tried to prevent the ruling party from building <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s tallest building in a city park that is popular with the poor. The High Court dismissed a suit filed Nov. 24 by environmentalist <PERSON> Wangari </PERSON> <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON> that sought to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> from building a 60-story tower in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s downtown Uhuru Park Justice <PERSON> Norbury </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugdale </PERSON>, in his ruling to a packed courtroom, said only the attorney general can sue on behalf of the public. Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON>, who before the ruling accused the court of being more concerned with `` politics than law,'' said she was disappointed with the decision but had written to acting Attorney General <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mibei </PERSON> asking him to take up the matter. `` The most important thing is to rise and express one's opinion and say no when you should say no,'' she said. `` If we are not listened to then at least we have done what we could do within our own constraints.'' <PERSON> Mibei </PERSON> was unavailable for comment Monday. The controversy involves the ruling party's plans to build a media complex in 10-acre Uhuru Park that would include the 60-story tower, two 10-story wings, malls, an auditorium, parking for 2,000 people, and conference facilities for 5,000 people. Scores of people have written letters to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s two independent newspapers criticizing the plan and pleading with the government to move the complex elsewhere. But President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> told critics two weeks ago to `` shut up'' and succeeded in silencing all but Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON>. A four-story statue of <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> is planned for the front of the tower. Mrs. <PERSON> Maathai </PERSON> has continued to pursue her efforts to get the building relocated to one of the vast open areas around <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> despite <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s threats to ban her environmental organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. She says the $ 197 million project is not in the public interest. Lawmakers said her court effort to bar the complex was tantamount to suing the head of state and accused her 12-year-old environmental group of being subversive.

<TEXT>
 Five years after his acquittal on cocaine trafficking charges, auto maker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Z </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> remains embroiled in litigation that has stalled his plans to launch a new, more exotic car company. `` It's incredible. What happens in the legal system is they keep you there until you run out of money and then they move on to someone else,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment. But the 64-year-old onetime golden boy of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s executive suites is n't discouraged. He says he sees an end to all the lawsuits and is delighted about a recent <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision throwing out a $ 60 million default judgment against him. `` All these things, if they do n't kill you they make you stronger,'' he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> has counter-sued the British government for $ 200 million _ one of the lawsuits still pending. In another, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, has sued him over fees. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> said he's spent $ 6 million to $ 7 million on legal fees since 1982. But he's not hurting for money. With bankruptcy proceedings resolved, he has regained access to a snow grooming company in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that he said is being sold for $ 26 million. <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> also said he's back on good terms with his former wife, model <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrare </PERSON>, with whom he underwent a bitter divorce. `` We're really getting along very well,'' he said. `` It's great for the children.'' As for his present love life, he said, `` I've been going with a nice girl. But I'm not sure I'm good at being married.'' What's left is his first and forever love _ cars. `` I've got another car I'm working on,'' he said. `` I'm building it in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. I have a number of patents.'' The new company, he said, wo n't start up until all of his lawsuits are settled, and it wo n't half as ambitious as <ORGANIZATION> DMC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's going to be an exotic,'' he said of his new dream car, `` a V-12, very high performance car and it will be very expensive, in the $ 175,000 range. The more expensive and more limited, the less it costs to go in.''

<HEAD>Residents Raise Crosses in Defiance of Atheist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUCONDA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An atheist forced village officials to remove lighted crosses from two water towers, but residents are fighting back with scores of home-made crosses in businesses, front yards and windows. Christmas spirit and town unity have never been stronger, residents of this community 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said Monday. `` We felt very badly that this man could come in here that does n't even live here, and say that we had to stop a tradition we've been doing for years,'' said <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolter </PERSON>. `` This is people's way of speaking out. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> official of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atheists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, contends the two disputed crosses _ which sat atop the village water towers for almost 40 years and traditionally were lighted for the Christmas season _ represented an unconstitutional mingling of church and state. He threatened to sue the village if the crosses, removed last winter for repairs, were used this Christmas season. The village board decided Nov. 21 to replace them with lighted stars rather than risk a costly legal battle. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said the board's decision was a `` smashing victory'' for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atheists </ORGANIZATION>, which has challenged the use of crosses and nativity scenes on public property across the country. `` This is the first time in the history of this country that illuminated Christian crosses have been forced down from government property without necessitating a lawsuit,'' said <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>. But if there are no crosses on the water towers, they've sprung up nearly everywhere else as the community of about 6,000 counters the move. One of the first appeared on top of Mers Restaurant, a block from the towers. `` When you see the crosses up, it's Christmas time,'' said restaurant co-owner <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Mers </PERSON>, a lifelong village resident. `` I'm still kind of upset that it's not on the tower I grew up with it.'' Hand-made crosses have appeared at Ms. <PERSON> Wolter </PERSON>'s jewelry store and other businesses and homes at the urging of Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Keagle </PERSON> and others. The Rev. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> has counted 95 crosses `` in just a fifth of my parish'' since he exhorted his congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> Transfiguration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to show their faith. `` Some are on the homes, some are in the yards, some are in the windows, some people have used their TV antennas to make crosses _ they've put lights on them,'' <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennebeck </PERSON>, vice president of Performance Paving, scaled a 110-foot telephone pole at his business to attach a 12-foot lighted cross near the top that he hopes will mark a new tradition. The effect is not just visual, <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said. `` Many people have come and told me that there's never been such unity and Christmas spirit as there's been now,'' he said. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said he thinks the response is more a show of resentment toward atheists than a display of Christian faith or Christmas spirit. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> disputes that. `` It's not attacking him at all, it is showing our Christianity,'' the priest said. `` In fact, we've got countless people here praying for him.''

<TEXT>
 The likes of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poppins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>, the Mad Hatter and the Tin Man enliven the White House this Christmas in a decoration theme highlighting first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to literacy. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday she hopes her holiday choice will encourage families to read together. `` There is sort of a little message to our Christmas this year _ which is a family oriented, reading to their children message,'' she said as she showed off the majestic 18-foot Christmas tree in the first floor Blue Room. The tree is decorated with 80 soft dolls each representing a character from a storybook or literature. Among them: a tafetta-bedecked <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> with wide-brimmed southern lady's hat; an ax-wieling <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunyon </PERSON> astride his blue ox, Babe; a satin-clad <PERSON> Aladdin </PERSON> with his genie bottle in hand; and a school-marmish <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> from the classic `` Little Women. Tiny books also adorn the tree, and beneath it have been placed an array of books wrapped with bows. `` This is sort of a celebration of libraries and books,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who for many years has devoted herself to the cause of literacy. The tree also has the traditional 100 four-inch velvet balls, two representing each state in the nation. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, fresh from her daily 1 -LCB- - mile swim, gave reporters a tour of the lavish White House decorations, which include 14 large, snow-flocked Blue Spruce trees in the entrance and cross halls at the main entrance Planning for the decorations began last February when the first lady discussed her wishes with the White house chief floral designer, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. In the East room stand two 14-foot Blue Spruce trees, ornately garlanded with copper-red metallic ribbons and bursting with life-size grapes, pears, apples, oranges, tangerines and pomegranates. Also in the East room against a central mirror is displayed the baroque 48-figure creche that has been in the White House every Christmas since 1967 when it was donated by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> woman. Numerous poinsettias deck the halls and in the State Dining Room, a giant gingerbread house is tempting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grandchildren, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. It was created by White House Executive Chef <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffert </PERSON>, who has baked a gingerbread house for the presidents annually for the last 20 years. The table in the State Dining Room features two boxwood topiaries decoated with densely packed candy canes, peppermint balls and cookies. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was a time when she did all the Christmas-cookie baking for the family but now their cook makes and decorates them. The Bushes will have their five children, spouses and 11 grandchildren on hand for the holiday. The entire clan will travel to the presidential retreat at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> David </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, next week to spend Christmas there. The family opens presents on Christmas day in what the first lady predicted will be `` chaos.'' She and the president will not exchange gifts, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We do not give presents, the president and I,'' she said adding that it is an arrangement they have followed for many years because `` We felt we just had so much.'' The Bushes were on hand this past weekend as 40 volunteers put up the Christmas decorations. They had intended to spend the weekend at Camp David, but were prevented by snowy weather. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said they enjoyed being there for the decorating. `` We bounced up and down the stairs, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and I, talking to these people.'' They came in Saturday night to find the decorators engaged in a snow fight with the fake snow, she added. The Bushes have their own personal Christmas tree in their private upstairs quarters and it is decorated with cookies, she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to drop a small-scale model of a satellite launch vehicle into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Thursday in a hush-hush program to develop a reusable, low-cost rocket, a space industry newspaper said Monday. The test will involve releasing the model booster from a helicopter to demonstrate that the booster can survive a water landing at 200 mph, said Space News, citing unnamed sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was asked for comment but did not immediately respond. The only reusable space vehicles the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has are the shuttle and its rocket boosters. The shuttle lands on a runway; the boosters drop into the ocean, are towed back to port to be refurbished for reuse. `` The project is being conducted on a shoestring budget with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> funds authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Admiral <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, chief of naval operations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source,'' <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in its Dec. 11 preview issue. The rocket would take off from the ocean surface, which would provide tremendous flexibility in launching secret missions. The spent stages would be slowed in their fall and buoyed at the surface by balloons.

 The leader of a violent crack ring was found guilty Monday of ordering the murder of a rookie police officer who was guarding the firebombed home of a witness in a drug case. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 31, faces mandatory life in prison without parole for a slaying that had come to symbolize the battle against illegal drugs. Jurors in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> deliberated 13 hours over three days before finding <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> guilty on all 11 drug-conspiracy charges, including one specifying that he ordered the February 1988 murder of Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, 22. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who had attended the trial daily, embraced and thanked Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, before quickly leaving court by a rear door.

Four other people were convicted in state court earlier this year of carrying out the murder and have been sentenced to the maximum of 25 years to life in prison. `` This accounts for all the people who had a hand in the brutal murder,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s conviction State authorities let <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> be tried in federal court because <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state rules of evidence restricting testimony by codefendants made conviction in state court less likely. During the trial of the four convicted murderers, there was frequent testimony that the order to assassinate <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had come from <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s cell at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION>. He had been convicted on a weapons charge and jailed two days before the slaying. The prosecution's key witness, <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, testified <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had directed the officer's murder because another patrolman `` disrespected'' him in front of his colleagues by upbraiding him for drinking beer in public. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> filed a motion to set the verdict aside, asserting <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was not mentally competent to participate in his trial, which lasted about two weeks.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday cited `` enormous frustrations'' in dealing with the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but said he will hunt again next year for bipartisan support for his sometimes-battered agenda. `` I'm disappointed in some ways with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and with our progress,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of editorial-page editors. He cited crime, clean-air legislation and child-care programs as examples. Democratic leaders in turn have said that those are all important issues but that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals would do too little to solve problems or would take unwise approaches. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also suggested that the $ 50 billion approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to rescue the ailing savings and loan industry `` might not be enough.'' In a half-hour question-and-answer session, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited `` negative, highly partisan comments'' from the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who began his term pronouncing an `` era of the offered hand,'' said: `` I'm determined, when the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes back, to hold out the hand and try again.'' On another partisan issue, the president dismissed as `` balderdash'' suggestions that Republicans are losing support among voters because of the abortion issue. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have not changed their fundamental views that had them support me over my opponent,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The Democrats hold a seat, hold a gubernatorial seat, and they dance around the grave of what they hope is the Republican party,'' he added. He was referring to the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race in which Democrat <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> won last month after a campaign emphasizing his views in favor of abortion rights. Overall, the president said he was generally satisfied with a `` productive year.'' He boasted that not one of his 10 vetoes had been overridden. On other topics in the wide-ranging session, the president: _ Denied his decision to send <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aide on a surprise visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> marked a move toward `` full normalization'' of relations. He said the weekend mission, four months after last June's bloody government crackdown, was an attempt not to further `` isolate the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people.'' _ Insisted he would do nothing to force the issue of German reunification. `` It's too sensitive and it's not the role for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, suggesting the day when either the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president or the Soviet leader had a role on the issue of European boundaries had long passed. _ Reiterated his desire that a drug summit can be held next February in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, despite recent violence there, saying he wanted no part of sending a signal that <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> `` can not provide the proper security.'' _ Said that he would give more attention next year to trade issues, saying that, while he had no intention of `` bashing'' trading partners needlessly, `` I am not relaxed about where we stand'' in terms of dismantling foreign barriers against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. _ Said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not favor any step that would force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to be `` pressured into negotiating'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, despite Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s efforts to help formulate a way to get <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks going. _ Said he was `` satisfied so far'' that <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> would receive a fair trial in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Casolo, 28, of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was arrested Nov. 26 in a police raid at her house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Police say they found weapons including grenades, and dynamite, hidden behind her house. On Friday, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was ordered held for 90 days while investigation continues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had personally told Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> `` that it's essential that a fair trial be granted.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also denied allegations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had mistreated a Salvadoran witness who had implicated the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the slayings of six Jesuit priests last month. On his relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` there have been some good moments and there've been some enormous frustrations.'' `` I am not overly satisfied, but I think the first year has gone pretty well,'' he said. He said he was particularly pleased that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ending the year with a still-growing economy. And, while difficult budget choices loom, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was pleased he had been `` able to keep my pledge of ` no new taxes' for this year.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that efforts to clean up the financially troubled savings and loan industry were proceeding haltingly. Despite the $ 50 billion <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to close down defunct S & amp; Ls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I'm now told this might not be enough.'' `` All I do know is that we've got to clean it up and it's a whale of a mess,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 A woman who was the anonymous plaintiff in one of two landmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions legalizing abortion said she hopes never to be separated from her 22-year-old daughter now that the two are reunited. `` I told her she's just going to have to plan on being with me the rest of her life,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, who had a tearful reunion with her daughter, April Takier of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> airport Saturday. The two were separated 20 years ago before Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensing </PERSON>, became plaintiff `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' in <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, the lawsuit that successfully challenged <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s abortion law. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> used her case to strike down the law on Jan. 22, 1973, the same day the court struck down <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' abortion law in the more famous case labeled <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> later decided not to go through with the abortion, and gave birth to <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. She gave her up for adoption in 1970. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> was reunited with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 19, earlier this year and found her son <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, now 23, in 1977. The reunion with April leaves only one of her four children still missing: a daughter, whom she named <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> before she gave her up for adoption in 1969. `` As long as she's missing, there's still part of me missing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. `` But I have nowhere else to look.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said her two older children, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and April, had been taken from her in 1969. She said she lost custody of the children after a dispute with a sitter and `` because of me being young and naive.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, who lives in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> but has declined to give her hometown, said she tried to regain custody of the children and finally got <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> when he was 11. She was unsuccessful in her attempts to find April until the week after Thanksgiving. Ms. <PERSON> Takier </PERSON> called, saying she had been trying to find her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family as a teen-ager. She said she remembered that her name originally was <PERSON> Bensing </PERSON> and that she was adopted in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, so `` my roommate and I sat down and all we did was start calling all the cities all over <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> looking for a Bensing.'' `` We could n't find that, so we looked for <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, my first foster family. I got their number and called her, and she had my grandma's phone number and my grandma had my mom's phone number.'' She said she did n't recognize her mother at their reunion Saturday, but `` my brother looks exactly like I remember him.'' Ms. <PERSON> Takier </PERSON> said she plans to stay in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> indefinitely and will seek work as a lab technician. `` I cried'' when she saw her mother, she said. `` I did n't know what to say. I'm so happy, so excited.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> has changed her position on abortion and has become a spokeswoman for anti-abortion groups in the years since <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>. She said last week that she plans to increase her involvement in the anti-abortion movement now that she has most of her family back.

 Congressional Democrats, denouncing renewed high-level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as `` embarrassing kowtowing,'' vowed Monday to revive legislation protecting <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students here and imposing sanctions against their government. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to dispatch two leading foreign policy advisers to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over the weekend undermines his administration's professed support for human rights and `` sends the worst possible message at the worst possible time.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s move makes `` a mockery of our profession of concern for human rights'' and was `` inconsistent with our stated ideals.'' The majority leader noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had declared in June that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not conduct normal relations with a government that had reacted to weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations with a bloody crackdown. `` Yet that is exactly what appears to be happening,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, referring to the mission to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> led by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision raises the question of how the administration might react if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened militarily to crackdown on democratic movements in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and within its own borders. `` Will the president send his emissaries to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to tell tham that we want to do business as usual?'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> asked hypothetically. `` Or are there two standards, one for the Chinese and another for the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> and everyone else?'' The majority leader also said he will lead efforts to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Nov. 30 veto of legislation to permit any Chinese student fearful of reprisal if forced to return home to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> beyond his visa's expiration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said then that he was directing Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` to take the steps necessary to extend administratively to all Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the same benefits'' that were in the bill he was vetoing. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted just before adjourning for the year Nov. 21 to impose political and economic sanctions on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government. But the approvals were to slightly different versions of the legislation and the differences were not resolved before adjournment. Both versions would have imposed as a matter of law sanctions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put in place days after the June 3 crackdown. Both measures would permit the sanctions to be lifted if the human rights situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> improved. The White House opposes that legislation, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs flexibility in lifting the sanctions, which include a suspension of financing for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and a ban on exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of military, nuclear and satellite technology. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs Asian subcommittee, said he believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of the visa-extension bill will be overridden and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will act quickly to revive the sanctions legislation when it returns next month. `` I believe the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in the mood to kowtow to these Chinese leaders,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s move `` ill timed to say the least. At a time of major breakthroughs for democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action sends the message that `` we care less about human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. Asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcment that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now has promised not to sell missiles in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> noted that an identical promise was made several years ago to then-Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` If the Chinese have now promised that a second time, the obvious question is, what happened the first time?'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself received a similar assurance when he visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in February.

<TEXT>
 Three organizations intent on helping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> enhance its 1990 harvest Monday urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture businesses to donate desperately needed machinery, chemicals, feed and animal pharmaceuticals. The donations are necessary because of a `` gap in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislative package'' that provided $ 533 million in assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Auspitz </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit educational and scientific organization that promotes free enterprise. The government is sending commodities and expertise to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but there was no provision in the law for the `` inputs'' _ such as machinery, fertilizer and feed _ needed to make a modern farm system work, <PERSON> Auspitz </PERSON> said. Polish banks, he said, do n't have the money to loan against next year's harvest to enable the farmers to buy those input items. Fertilizers, animal-care products, animal feed, pesticides, fungicides and herbicides top the list of items Polish farmers need. Also needed is machinery such as, planters, grain drills, potato seeders, fertilizer spreaders, manure spreaders, plows, sprayers, chain saws and harvesters. `` It is feasible financially for companies to donate -LRB- these items -RRB- without losing a lot of money,'' <PERSON> Auspitz </PERSON> said at a day-long seminar sponsored by his foundation, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the Foundation for the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, a private Polish group dedicated to strengthening that nation's private sector farms The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax code allows for a deduction of twice the cost for donations of inventory property for the care of the ill, the needy or minor children. Private Polish farmers qualify as needy, said tax lawyer <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who appeared on a panel with <PERSON> Auspitz </PERSON>. He said companies should make donations to a tax-exempt organization, such as <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, which will certify the products are going as gifts for the needy. The donated materials may not be given to Polish government-owned farms or the government itself to qualify for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax deduction. About 77 percent of the farms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are private, but under communism, the state cooperatives were the only ones benefitting from technological advances, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said during a separate panel discussion. `` The private sector has been starved from modern inputs,'' he said. Polish farmers need the machinery and chemicals by April 1, the beginning of the growing season, to show progress in the 1990 harvest. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> encouraged participation, saying in a letter that <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>'s plan follows the intent of the agreement on private-sector cooperation between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The National Opposition Union on Monday accused the governing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> of waging a campaign of provocation and violence to intimidate opponents in the Feb. 25 elections. <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, the opposition union's vice presidential candidate, and other party leaders told a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> provoked rioting Sunday in <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION> in which one man was killed and more than 20 people were injured. He said the National Opposition Union -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has sent a report on the violence to a summit of five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> supporters also took part in the fighting, but insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> started it. `` Violence generates violence; this is inevitable,'' he said. `` Nobody here is going to wait to have their throat slit. But the provocations continue, and the one responsible for this is the Sandinista Front.'' he said. He added that <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> will not pull out of the campaign. Other party officials told the news conference that after the rioting in <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, groups of masked men attacked <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> supporters in many nearby villages. They said they were asking for protection from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> election observers. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' plan to hold a rally in <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION> `` makes us think that the government has decided to escalate the violence to try to impede normal development'' of the election campaign. Witnesses in Masatepe Sunday said clashes broke out during a <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> rally at the town park and combatants fought with machetes, rocks and sticks. The Sandanistas' Masatepe campaign headquarters was attacked and a car and motocycle were set afire. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerda </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee, said he and 12 other people had taken refuge in the party headquarters when he saw about 200 people approach, vowing to shoot everyone inside. He said he and the others escaped through the back of the building. The building was heavily damaged and the furniture burned. A home next door also was sacked. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Casco </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION>, said groups of hooded men fired at a house in nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardo </LOCATION> with rifles and doused another home with gasoline and threatened to burn it unless the occupants came out. When two men came out of the house one was beaten with clubs and the other was doused with fuel and threatened with incineration, <PERSON> Casco </PERSON> said. Similar incidents occurred in other villages, he said. `` It was a night of terror.'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, 38, of La Concepcion village, was stabbed to death. Reports in pro-government newspapers quoted his mother, <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, as blaming <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> militants. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the Sandinista government `` is at a crossroads. `` It can hold free and fair elections without violence and intimidation, and begin the process of bringing peace to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Or it can continue to turn the thugs loose on peaceful opposition rallies, thereby ensuring the election results will be deemed illegitimate and that the crisis in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will continue.'' Sandinista and <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> groups have battled several times since campaigning began in early November but the <PERSON> Masatepe </PERSON> rioting was the worst. On Dec. 3, rival groups engaged in a stone-throwing melee in <LOCATION> Confradias </LOCATION>, 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and dozens were injured. The presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are trying to arrange truces in the civil war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the fighting between Nicaraguan rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Under an earlier agreement, Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> advanced the general election to this February from November 1990 and promised they would be free and fair. In exchange the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders declared they would try to demobilize the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, most of whom are based in Honduran border camps, by Dec. 5. The Contras, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing, defied the deadline, saying they should remain as a fighting force to make certain the elections are fair.

<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury indicted a reputed high-ranking officer in an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> drug organization Monday for allegedly conspiring to export $ 1 billion worth of heroin from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the alleged operation was sort of a `` Golden Triangle Factory Outlet'' for heroin. The Golden Triangle is a remote drug-producing region of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The case relied in part on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s first approval of roving wiretaps, in which 30 pay telephones were tapped in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pocono </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> resort region, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said suspects in the drug ring used pay telephones to elude detection. When surveillance showed the suspects were making a call from one of the 30 phones, the wiretap was activated and calls to seven or eight foreign countries monitored, he said. He said the alleged deal to bring as much as 2,000 kilograms _ 4,400 pounds _ of heroin into this country a year through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> represents the largest heroin trafficking scheme known to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Named in the indictment was Na Ts ` ai K'uei, pronounced Na-Say-Cue, a native of <LOCATION> Yunan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, who had been living in <LOCATION> Chiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ra </LOCATION> province in Na, already serving a jail term in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, is considered one of the most skilled heroin chemists and refinery operators in the Golden Triangle, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. `` What impresses me after 19 years in law enforcement is that this indictment comes in at the highest levels,'' West said. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the charges stem from a two-year-old investigation of a heroin-trafficking organization based in the <LOCATION> Poconos </LOCATION>. The leader of that organization, <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to import heroin from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and is awaiting sentencing. The investigation is continuing, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. The prosecutor claimed Na is one of the highest-ranking officers in the <ORGANIZATION> Shan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a rebel force of more than 4,000 heavily armed soldiers that operates primarily in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the Shan leader, known as <PERSON> Khun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sa </PERSON>, is considered the world's largest supplier of heroin. <PERSON> Khun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sa </PERSON> and the SUA have controlled opium and heroin production in the Gold Triangle along the Thai-Burma border since the 1960s, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sa </PERSON>'s organization is responsible for all phases of heroin production, including opium poppy crops and laboratories to refine heroin and morphine. Under terms of the deal, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> said, an initial shipment of 100 kilograms of heroin, several thousand kilograms of marijuana and various weapons, including M-16 assault rifles and rocket and grenade launchers, were shipped to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. According to the indictment, the drugs were to be smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the weapons funneled to Colombian drug lords. Thai police, alerted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators, intercepted some of the drugs, but not the weapons, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. West alleged the deal was arranged by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Castagnola </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who went to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to arrange for annual shipments of 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms of heroin. <PERSON> Castagnola </PERSON> also has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. Na began serving a six-year jail term in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in May for possession of 500 grams of opium, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> do not have an extradition treaty, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said every effort would be made to bring Na to this country.

<TEXT>
 Police officials met with black leaders Monday to discuss the apparent accidental shooting of an unarmed black man by a white policeman during a drug search. `` We want to get as much information out as possible,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 28, was shot in the back of the head in a predominantly black neighborhood Sunday by Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, 28. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was in critical condition Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and was not expected to recover, doctors said. <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said the timing was `` unfortunate'' because of events in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The shooting was the second involving a police officer and an unarmed suspect in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> jury on Thursday convicted Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> of manslaughter in the deaths of two black men killed last January. The slayings triggered three days of rioting, and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had braced for more unrest in the event <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was acquitted. Later Thursday, a <LOCATION> Hallandale </LOCATION> police officer shot and killed an unarmed robbery suspect following a car chase. Both the suspect and the officer were black. On Sunday, <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>'s .45 - caliber automatic apprently went off accidentally as <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was pinned against a car, police Officials said they were unsure why the officer drew his gun because the suspect was n't armed. Gerwens contacted black leaders Sunday, held a news conference, and met with them again Monday to release more information. Black leaders told reporters they were satisfied with the way things were being handled. `` The only thing we can do now is wait for the investigation,'' said <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, former president of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` We need to know exactly what happened and how the firearm discharged.'' The <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state attorney's office is investigating the incident. Prosecutors said a grand jury would decide whether to charge <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>. The police department is also investigating. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> and his partner were looking for drug dealers in one of the city's most violent neighborhoods in northern <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> when they encountered <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and another man. Witnesses said <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> cursed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, then grabbed him and threw him against a car. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> then put his gun at the back of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s head. `` Pat's hands were up and he started to turn around and then the gun went off,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who was standing less than 10 feet away. `` Then the cop said, ` Oh my God, my gun went off,''' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. No statement has been taken from <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, who has been with the department since August. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> is on administrative leave with pay `` to collect himself,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has been arrested several times and been convicted of armed robbery and cocaine possession with intent to deliver, police said. He did not have any cocaine on him at the time of the shooting, they said.

A joint statement issued by the ambassadors Monday said: `` There was a common understanding of the importance of stability, and confidence was expressed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could contribute to that on the basis of the quadripartite agreement of 1971.'' It was the first meeting since the 1971 session that produced agreement on improving the links between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, which was isolated within <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. After World War II, the four victorious Allies divided <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> into four sectors. They still have the final say in its affairs. A Soviet diplomat in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said privately after Monday's 2 -LCB- - hour conference: `` In principle, for all the four powers, it was a very important We -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- underlined the need for stability.'' Those attending were by <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallaby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Boidevaix </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and French ambassadors to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochemasov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They made no comment, but posed for cameras under the flags of their countries, which hanged side by side from a balcony of the ornate former courthouse that serves at the Allied <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. In their statement, the ambassadors said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had `` expressed favorable interest'' in an initiative on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlined in 1987. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to `` work to bring the Eastern and West parts of the city closer together.'' His proposal also called for improved air service to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, making the city the site of youth exchanges and international conferences, and holding a future Olympics there. Further meetings of the four powers may be held, the statement said. A French diplomat would not give a timetable, but said the level of future sessions would depend on the issues to be addressed. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and its other borders a month ago to halt a flood of emigration and huge pro-democracy protests at home. Since then, public demand for reform has become so great the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership resigned. Such West German politicians as Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, former chancellor and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mayor, have made a point of visiting the city. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be reunited one day, but not now. He was attending a meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday, and told reporters: `` We do not know when the day will come when this vision will become reality, but I am convinced that it will come.'' Of the concern in some countries about reunification, he said: `` The goal of our policies is not to create an overpowering <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the middle of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said solution of `` the German question within a European framework'' would respect the security needs of all others involved. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is to meet with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday. The talks had been planned for <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the West German capital, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they would be held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. On Sunday, before leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that, if reunification `` happens too abruptly, you run a greater risk that it might not happen peacefully.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday it was too sensitive an issue among the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies for the process to be speeded up, and added: `` This is a matter for the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people to decide; it is n't a matter that's going to be determined by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dorothee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s minister in charge of relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said `` Germans have the right of self-determination just like any other people.'' In an interview with <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state radio, she said <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity `` was part of the way to <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday defended his decision to renew contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, saying relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are still strained by the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> crackdown but `` I do n't want to make it any worse.'' He pledged to `` keep looking for ways to find common ground'' despite the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army's killing of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators last June. `` I do n't want to see that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains totally isolated,'' the president said. However, he said his initiative toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` not a signal of total normalization'' of relations. Acknowledging that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains unapologetic for the crackdown, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We have contacts with countries that have egregious records on human rights.'' Even as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke, congressional Democrats stepped up their criticism of his actions. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overture as `` embarrassing kowtowing to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his comments in a question and answer session with editorial page editors from around the country after the return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the White House national security adviser, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, deputy secretary of state, from their surprise trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The president hailed an announcement from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that it would not sell missiles in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called that `` a very sound development,'' though he had received the same assurances during a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last February. Explaining his decision to send <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do not want to isolate the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. I do not want to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Generally speaking, I realize the difficulty of this relationship. I do n't want to make it any worse _ like to think it would improve.'' Even so, he said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions imposed against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on June 5 remain in place and that the administration was still unhappy with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s human rights record. A White House statement acknowledged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided in September to allow <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> engineers to resume work with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team installing high-tech equipment on F-8 jet fighters to be sold to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` This was the only way to avoid turning a suspension -LRB- of military sales -RRB- into a termination,'' the statement said, adding that no deliveries have taken place. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked in guarded terms, refusing to say precisely what steps <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would have to take to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Referring to the crackdown, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think the Chinese know they still have to address themselves to the problems that were inherent in this episode.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded with an emphatic `` No'' when asked if he worried that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger trip would signal the Soviets that he would tolerate a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I have no concern about that at all as long as we are properly positioned in favor of human rights ... and as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knew that we are not sending a signal of, quote, total normalization, unquote. I will be careful that we do not send that signal,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks were part of a wider attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to explain the gesture toward <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to and to soften criticism. The administration said that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a world power with a nuclear arsenal, was too important a country to remain in isolation, despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outrage at its killing of demonstrators last June. Echoing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s theme, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` This trip was not intended to develop normal relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in any immediate sense.'' Democrats, meanwhile, continued to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision. `` At a time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s bipartisan commitment to freedom is bearing fruit in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the last thing he should be doing is wavering in our commitment to freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` Standing up for our principles is always the best policy,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't stand up for those who seek freedom, who will?'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said, `` The administration supports human rights in its words. It does not do so in its deeds. ... These actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for human rights and our inconsistent with our stated ideals.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to send emissaries to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` had nothing to do with concessions made or internal changes'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman it was the democratic changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that prompted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to send Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> on their mission. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt `` these are changes in the world that have to be considered by all the leaders certainly of the West as well as the East, that it's important to know how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> responds, how they think about this, how they see their changing relationship to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Eastern bloc.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was unhappy the Scowcroft-Eagleburger visit had been portrayed in the Chinese press as evidence of U.S.-Chinese reconciliation. `` I probably would have dictated a little different coverage,'' he said.

 Nearly 4,000 mourners, led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, attended a joint funeral Mass on Monday for nine of the 14 women that a church leader said were brutally slain `` in the beauty of their youth'' by a mass murderer. Thousands of others stood in below-freezing temperatures, quietly listening outside to the 80-minute service on loudspeakers. Monsignor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, presided at the services at Notre Dame cathedral for the victims of the worst mass slaying in modern Canadian history. He noted that the women, almost all students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> engineering school, were killed `` at a time when everything seemed to assure them of a brilliant future.'' <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> urged that in the memory of those who were `` brutally mowed down in the beauty of their youth,'' we should `` seek to build a world of solidarity, a world of friendship.'' Many schools and universities throughout <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> province observed a minute of silence as the Mass started in the Place d'Armes at 10:30 a.m. EST. A man identified as <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, killed the women in a murderous rage last Wednesday and also wounded nine women and five men before committing suicide with his semiautomatic rifle. He shouted diatribes against feminists while roaming through three of the school's six floors. The 14 women were aged 21 to 31. One was a school employee. The others were students. `` We have the tools in our hand to build a better world, a world of peace,'' <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Perreault </PERSON>, president of the students' association at the engineering school, said in a brief eulogy. He spoke of the victims' dreams and hopes and pleaded, `` Let's achieve these great things ... of hope, of understanding. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dore </PERSON>, the school's president and principal, said it was a legacy for survivors `` to build a world of tomorrow, a world where every one of us, men and women, contribute equally.'' He called for building `` a city of joy, a city of love.'' Families of victims, dignitaries and students filled the cathedral in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s historic center. The nine gilt-edged white coffins, each with a floral bouquet, were placed single-file in the cathedral's central corridor. Processions later divided for separate, private burials. Families of five victims had chosen private funeral services. Professional associations asked engineers across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to wear white armbands Monday as a memorial. On Sunday, at least 7,000 people paid respects to eight of the victims whose coffins lay in state at the university's columned hall of honor. The gunman burst into the school on the last day of classes before examinations. Witnesses said he shouted `` I want the women!'' and `` You're all a bunch of feminists! I hate feminists!'' He separated men from women before opening fire in one classroom where six women died. He left a suicide letter that blamed women for much of his unhappiness. Police said <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> had studied with apparent hopes of entering the engineering school, but no indication exists he ever actually applied.

The arctic front blanketed eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> with snow overnight. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, received 5.5 inches. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area had an inch or less of snow, and officials there reported only minor weather-related traffic problems. There were clouds over much of the south central and eastern portions of the country, and sunny skies in the northern and central Plains and the middle and upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Strong northerly winds ushered the cold air into the central <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, bringing the 50-below-zero wind chills to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> early Monday. The strong winds also produced snow squalls in the upper <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region. An upper level weather disturbance brought snow to the southern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and southern high Plains. Light snow fell on much of eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, had two inches of fresh snow on the ground by late morning.

Gusts up to 100 mph were recorded in the Grapevine area of the <ORGANIZATION> Tehachapis </ORGANIZATION>. An advisory for snow and blowing snow was posted for the eastern slopes of the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, where southwest winds of 25 to 50 mph were sharply reducing visibilities in local ground blizzards, and were producing wind chill readings as low as 40 degrees below zero. High winds continued to buffet the snow-capped mountain peaks of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, but an official said weather was not a factor in an islandwide power failure.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Monday he is `` still bullish'' about the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> despite the latest coup attempt and thinks President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government will survive. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he is visiting <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> as a private citizen and that his trip was planned by his company five months ago. He now is a director of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> construction and engineering conglomerate. A seven-day military rebellion ended on Saturday when the last rebel holdouts surrendered at <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> air base, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The uprising killed at least 113 people and injured more than 580. `` I have a feeling that this effort by a renegade group in the military to overturn a democratic government has had a kind of reverse effect,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said the coup attempt `` galvanized the people, leading people to say that we struggled hard to get a free and democratic system... and it is precious and so we have to fight for it and support it. He said this will mean a strong following for the present leadership, `` and so I continue to be bullish on the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he and his wife have become close to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and were invited by her to dinner Sunday. `` She was in a very upbeat and feisty mood and I think it was great,'' he reported. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air cover that was provided for loyal forces early in the insurrection was `` helpful'' in fighting the rebellion. `` It would have been shameful'' for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to refuse support to `` a friend ... a democracy under siege.'' `` I believe that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handled it extremely well. It's the sort of thing that friends expect to see,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> added He also said the pro-democracy movement sweeping <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is `` a phenomenon -LRB- that -RRB- is being replayed and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> started it.'' He was referring to the `` people power'' revolt that drove the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into Hawaiian exile and installed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as president in February 1986. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Monday called on Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> carried no message from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Pensions Increased for Widows of Servicemen Killed Before 1973</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 53,000 widows of British servicemen killed in action before 1973 will receive an increase of $ 62 in their weekly pension, the government announced Monday. Legislators of all political parties had called for a correction in the disparity between the amounts given to widows of servicemen killed before and after 1973. Widows of more than 2,000 servicemen killed in combat since 1973 get a minimum weekly pension of $ 196. The maximum weekly amount given to widows of servicemen killed before 1973 was $ 90. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> told Parliament the pension increases will be tax free and payments will begin in April. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government `` recognizes the very special place that these widows hold in the affections of this country, and the particular debt that we all owe them.'' <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, the singing sweetheart of World War II soldiers, had campaigned for the pension improvements and said she was disappointed the payments would n't start until April. `` It's a shame it's not more and it's sad they could n't have had it for Christmas,'' she said. `` It would have been a lovely present for them.'' <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyes </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, called the government's decision `` a major, though acceptable U-turn.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A joyous cacophony of bells and whistles heralded a popular victory over the Communists, and Czechoslovaks settled down Monday to choosing a president from among heroes the old order called villains. A presidential contest appeared to be developing, and the people may get to decide. `` This is the end of communism!'' exulted <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Navara </PERSON>, an actress in pink mukluks, adding the sound of a brass chime to the bells of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Old Town Square. Her 3-year-old daughter made a triumphant `` V'' with two tiny fingers. The brief blast of noise replaced a threatened general strike, canceled after events brought to power the first government in 41 years not dominated by Communists and drove President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> from office. Soldiers began removing barbed wire from the border with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> radio reported plans to disband Pacem im <PERSON> Terris </PERSON>, a state-controlled organization of Roman Catholic clergy. Priests outside the group often were persecuted as the state tried to impose its will. In the first official act against members of the old leadership, the prosecutor charged former party ideologue <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> for his part in crushing the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring of reform, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` According to some opinions, his deeds can be considered treason,'' it said, but added that <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON>, now 72, could not be tried because the statute of limitations had run out. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: _ <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bulgarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said free elections should be held in May and a new constitution written that does not guarantee the party a monopoly on power. _ The four Allies of World War II held their first meeting in 18 years Monday and stressed the need for stability at a time of rapid change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It was requested by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is concerned about German reunification. _ More than 150,000 people held a pro-democracy rally in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, a southern industrial city in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and many called for German unity. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> meets Tuesday and has two weeks to elect a president, but the Club of Communist Deputies, similar to a majority party caucus, said Monday it would support a referendum. A statement from the club said it would `` recommend to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to adopt the necessary measures for an all-people's vote'' because `` the authority of the head of state is so important that only the people can decide,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. Earlier, Politburo member <PERSON> Ondrej </PERSON> <PERSON> Saling </PERSON> said the Communists and opposition had agreed the president should be a Czech with no party affiliation. `` In my view, the president must be someone who enjoys broad support and guarantees stability,'' he said. That seemed to suggest <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the playwright who was jailed for opposing communism and is now the driving force behind Civic Forum, the main opposition. Posters reading `` Havel na Hrad'' _ `` <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> to the Castle,'' the presidential residence _ sprouted all over <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The candicacy of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who led the 1968 reform as party chief until Soviet tanks arrived, threw the result into doubt, however, and other names were being mentioned. In a late-evening television interview with Soviet television, shown in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said he would keep his country in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. While evoking an ideal of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` as a peaceful community'' with no military blocs, he said `` we shall not get any closer to this ideal by any kind of individual split from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> treaty,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s gravelly voice rolled over a crowd of 100,000 people Sunday in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. As he listed popular victories over the past three weeks, which the people had come to celebrate, they chanted `` We want Havel!'' and he made a very presidential bow. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 68, remains a popular symbol but evokes little emotion among younger Czechoslovaks, who regard him as a product of the system they intend to abolish. He also is a Slovak, as is <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, the new premier. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> has said a political tradition, under which one office is held by a Slovak and the other by a Czech, would be respected. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> joins <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in forming an administration not dominated by Communists, but unlike <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, its government is led by a member of the party. `` We have not won yet,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> told the Sunday rally, which was televised live. But, he added, `` The years-long, deadly silence of a humiliated people has been drowned out by a multivoiced popular choir.'' A rally in support of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was held Monday at <LOCATION> Plzen </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and many Czechoslovaks ringing bells around the country also wore the ubiquitous blue, red and white `` Havel for President'' buttons. The burst of bell-ringing occurred three weeks to the day after students rose up, angered by brutal police assaults on peaceful demonstrators. They surged through the streets of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, stopping street cars to sound their bells, then everyone joined in. Soon afterward, a liberty bell appeared on a hill above <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> where a statue of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> once had been. In letters visible across the <LOCATION> Vltava </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, it was labeled, `` The final bell,'' the last line of every Czechoslovak fairy tale.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said Monday <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wants guarantees from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will have no role in the peace process before he attends talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. No date has been set for the meeting between <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. The three will discuss the composition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to direct talks with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. In violence Monday in the occupied territories, troops shot and wounded 14 Palestinian protesters, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was investigating. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> cast some doubt Monday on his planned trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, saying he is concerned about reports that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is acting as a `` postman'' for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Egyptians, who started the process as an independent factor, have lately presented themselves as, in effect, a postman for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` If this is what will be, I fear that we wo n't get very far.'' Last month, the Cabinet linked Israeli acceptance of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting to assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would play no part in the peace process Asked about the proposed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said, `` Firstly, I'm not going yet. We will first conduct contacts concerning the guarantees that our Cabinet has requested.'' Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Eliakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> is scheduled to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to discuss the assurances sought by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The latest hitch in the talks followed weekend news reports that Israeli, Egyptian, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> officials were holding secret contacts to draw up a preliminary list of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators. The clashes Monday were sparked by the fatal shootings Sunday of two Palestinians, apparently by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians who opened fired after their cars were stoned, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The deaths raised to 631 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis during the two-year uprising against Israeli rule. At least 155 other Palestinians have been killed by their fellow Arabs who accused them of cooperating with Israeli authorities or involvement in prostitution or drug-dealing. Forty-three Israelis also have died. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a military court sentenced four Palestinian men to prison terms ranging from 10 to 14 years for throwing firebombs at military patrols in April 1989, a military spokesman said. No one was injured in the attacks. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police said they detained for questioning at least 21 Palestinian youths after the funeral of 17-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Muneir </PERSON> turned into a nationalist demonstration. <PERSON> Muneir </PERSON>'s family claims he died Sunday as a result of beatings by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, but a police investigation reported he died of natural causes. About 500 Arab youths marched behind <PERSON> Muneir </PERSON>'s coffin, singing the Palestinian national anthem and waving the outlawed red, white, black and green Palestinian flag. Nearly 100 police and paramilitary border policemen stood guard. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military administration of the occupied territories ordered the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to keep the 90 schools it operates for Palestinian refugees in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> closed until the new academic year begins Jan. 10. A spokesman for the administration said all 930 schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> will remain closed until then. The schools have been closed since the school year ended Nov. 1. <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> had announced its schools would reopen Monday to give students a chance to complete the past academic year. The students were unable to complete the full year because many schools have been closed frequently during the uprising.

<HEAD>Peru in Pact with International Monetary Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After four years of disagreements, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it has reached an accord with <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> that could mean financial aid for the country if Peruvian policies meet its approval. An official of the fund, who spoke on condition he not be named, said <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> had made a payment of $ 42.3 million the $ 800 million it owes the fund. The payment covers only the arrears since September of this year. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has been in trouble with lenders since President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was elected in 1985 and announced that he would make only partial payments of interest on the country's debts. At that time <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> owed $ 14 billion abroad. Now the figure is closer to $ 20 billion. Its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuing rebellion of a strong leftist group, the Shining Path, and a thriving traffic in drugs. Owned by 152 governments, the fund negotiates at length with those in financial trouble. It gives its help only when the borrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves. Usually these include cuts in government spending, especially on official payrolls and subsidies, and often a devaluation of the country's currency. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of $ 3.5 billion to the fund, and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it _ and in practice, unlikely to get much from anyone else. This year the fund started a series of what it called `` shadow programs,'' under which governments promised new policies but got no immediate money. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guayana </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and now <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> have started such programs. If the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so, they will start getting its financial help.

 <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was flown to the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday for trial on charges of trafficking in drugs while he was interior minister in a former <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> military government. He has been accused of leading a cocaine trafficking operation while he was <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s top law enforcement official. He also hired Nazi war criminal <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON> to advise paramilitary forces that tortured and killed opposition political and labor figures. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> alleges that <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> secret police under his control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay for protection, and delivered it to smugglers who did pay. Two lieutenants of <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> who were charged with him once received $ 1.5 million for cocaine that was confiscated by <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> authorities and stored in bank vaults, according to the indictment. It says <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> personally ordered the cocaine released. `` He was indicted along with 18 other individuals and charged with various violations of the criminal drug laws of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> `` Specifically, the charges involved conspiracies related to the importation, distribution and intent to distribute narcotics,'' she said. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> had a reputation for ruthlessness and for personally torturing political prisoners. He was named interior minister in 1980 and rounded up hundreds of journalists, political and labor leaders and church officials. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, he was removed from office in 1981. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1982 and was arrested under the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment, but the military government there freed him in December 1983, just before turning over power to the civilian administration of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. His whereabouts were not known until he was captured Sunday at a ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a hub for drug traffickers 350 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. He offered no resistance when hundreds of police officers arrived at the ranch. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` We think it was a couragous act by the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government to capture this man, who not only was and is an important cocaine trafficker but was also responsible to a great extent for the growth of the cocaine trade.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> republican, said Monday at the end of a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>: `` We are pleased that criminals like this are being dealt with in this matter and we hope to assist in any way we can.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement, `` <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> today has apprehended and turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who has been a fugitive from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice since 1983. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was wanted in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> where he has been charged with two counts of drug trafficking along with co-defendant <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was recently extradited from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` The arrest of <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> sends a message that the president will work with other goverments to pursue vigorously individuals who traffic in drugs.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Capobianco </PERSON> said he had advised and received support from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s main political parties for sending <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was stripped of Bolivian citizenship last year for failing to show up for trial in this country on charges of human rights violations and cocaine trafficking.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling drunken driving `` one of the most deadly scourges'' of our times, promised Monday to keep up pressures to get intoxicated drivers off the road. His transportation secretary suggested new restrictions on alcohol advertising may be necessary. Their comments came at a briefing at the White House for 150 anti-drunken driving activists plus health and safety officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation declaring this National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week and issued a proclamation saying, `` As we prepare to celebrate the holidays and rejoice in the promise of the new year, it is fitting that we pause to remember the perils of drinking and driving.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was peppered with questions before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke about why the government does not raise excise taxes on alcohol to discourage drinking and does not restrict brewers' and liquor manufacturers' ads. `` I'm not so sure it is n't time to revisit those issues'' of regulating advertising, said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said people are `` not going to stop drinking,'' but said they must be stopped `` from getting behind the steering wheel.'' Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was more direct, telling the briefing that the nation should `` consider some form of restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic beverages.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the public outcry in recent years against drunken drivers has been `` one of the most amazing success stories of the 1980s.'' Drunken driving deaths fell 20 percent in the last six years, although the number of miles traveled rose 25 percent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Still, almost 500,000 Americans are injured in alcohol-related accidents and half the 50,000 fatalities on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s highways each year are alcohol-related, `` an annual toll that would nearly fill the polished granite walls of the Vietnam Memorial,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He called drunken driving `` one of the most deadly scourges ever to strike modern times. And it's as crippling as crack, as random as gang violence. And it's killing more kids than both combined.'' To those who have crusaded against drunken driving, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` speaking not only as president, but as a father and as a grandfather, you have my respect, my admiration and my thanks.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> senator urged motorists to turn on their headlights for three hours on the last day of December to remind other drivers not to drink and drive on New Year's Eve. `` And it will be a memorial to all those victims of drunk driving who will not be with us to celebrate the dawn of the new decade,'' Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., said at a news conference

 Two explosions seven minutes apart rocked downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, killing two people and damaging the main train station, police said early Tuesday. The first blast at 11:30 p.m. Monday killed two men believed to be Indians, said police spokesman Col. <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Heymans </PERSON>. He said police suspected a limpet mine was used. The second blast was heard throughout downtown but police could not determine the location after searching for more than an hour. No one claimed responsibility and <PERSON> Heymans </PERSON> declined to speculate on who may have been involved. More than 100 bombings have hit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since a state of emergency was declared in June 1986. Most were blamed on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which is based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, and is fighting to undermine white domination. About 16,000 transportation workers have been on strike since Nov. 2. Management has blamed them for arson and sabotage attacks that have caused more than $ 8 million in property damage. Earlier, police said 16 blacks were killed Sunday and 65 homes destroyed in factional fighting in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. About 2,000 people have died since late 1986 in battles among blacks there. Fire and hospital officials said four blacks were killed, eight injured and more than 100 homes were razed on Sunday in arson attacks related to a power struggle in the Crossroads shantytown outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D.M </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> acquitted an army officer and 12 policemen of murder in the case of a boy shot dead in 1985 by officers hidden in crates on an unmarked truck. It was the first murder trial held under a law allowing private citizens to press prosecution in certain cases in which the government declines to do so. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said the officers did not act with premeditation in the 1985 shooting death of <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Magoed </PERSON>, 16. The white officers concealed themselves in what looked like an ordinary delivery truck that was driven into a mixed-raced township near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> during anti-apartheid unrest. Magoed and two other youths were killed after they threw stones at the truck in a case that became known as the `` Trojan Horse incident.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> advised police to stop such operations, saying they could endanger innocent people. <PERSON> Magoed </PERSON>'s father pursued the case on his own after the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> attorney general declined to prosecute.

 More than 150,000 people rallied for democracy in this southern industrial city Monday night, with shouting matches breaking out for a fourth straight week over whether <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should reunite. `` We in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and those in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- are and will remain Germans,'' one speaker said, to roared approval from some and boos from others. `` What belongs together will grow together.'' ADN, the official news agency, said 40,000 people demonstrated at <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> for a referendum on reunification before elections planned in May. It said the crowd also demanded that cells of the discredited <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> be disbanded by Dec. 15. Other rallies took place in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Halle </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, the agency reported. It said the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> crowd also divided on the reunification issue. It was the fourth week <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity was a central issue of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s regular Monday night rally. Dozens of West German flags waved in the crowd. Some demonstrators carried signs saying `` No Fourth Reich'' and urging East Germans not to let their country become a West German `` plantation.'' `` There are two real movements now,'' said a young woman opposed to reunification. `` It's too bad it's come to this.'' In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television said: `` The fear of a deep division within the opposition is huge, because of the different goals.'' Throughout the evening, protesters on both sides shouted at each other. Reunification has become an increasingly bitter topic for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s New Forum opposition group, which sponsors the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> rallies. New Forum says reunification would mean a `` sellout'' to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Calls for and against German unity were not the only demands. Many demonstrators warned fellow East Germans against `` attacks and taking law into their own hands.'' As they press their beleaguered government to carry through with promises of reforms, East Germans have increasingly been swept up in a frenzy to root out corruption, leading to many warnings against the use of violence. Monday night's protest was sponsored by the 200,000-member New Forum, the nation's largest opposition group. The organization said Monday it will take part as a political party in the nation's first free election, slated for May 6, and will hope to form its own parliamentary group. A national congress of New Forum to launch the group as a party will be held in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Jan. 6-7. Another opposition group, <PERSON> Demokratischer </PERSON> <PERSON> Aufbruch </PERSON>, which means democratic `` start'' or `` awakening,'' called on the government to pass immediate regulations allowing foreign companies to transfer their profits out of the country and that would guarantee protection of investments. Earlier Monday, the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> spoke by telephone with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and that the two men had agreed to meet soon. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised the party's `` rejection of attempts to damage the sovereignty of the country,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The questions of East German sovereignty have become increasingly important with the growing turmoil in the Communist nation. There have been predictions the rapid changes could lead to steps toward unification with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is watching the East German situation with `` extraordinary attention'' and promised <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would consider providing support `` within the current framework of conditions.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said he is counting on Soviet backing in rebuilding the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and enacting democratic reform, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. ADN did not specify a date for their meeting.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Desegregation Settlement, Blasts School Districts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday approved the $ 130 million settlement of the largest desegregation case in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> history, but blasted school districts for suggesting the money be used to retire debts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, saying it was `` abundantly clear'' the parties in the case could not be trusted with the money, ordered it put in an escrow account monitored by a court-appointed supervisor. `` The amount of money is meager enough,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> wrote in his opinion. The judge also scaled back <ORGANIZATION> NACCP </ORGANIZATION> attorneys' fees in the case from $ 3.15 million to $ 850,000. The settlement ends seven years of litigation involving the state, three school districts in <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, and black students' parents. The Little Rock School District, which is mostly black, sued the state and the neighboring, mostly white <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> districts, alleging the defendants caused illegal segregation in Little Rock schools. The settlement was reached in March. In a special session in July, the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> agreed to spend $ 129.75 million over 10 years for desegregation programs. Woods on Monday endorsed the agreement as approved Oct. 4 by Special Master <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>. Attorneys for the county and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> districts had objected to revisions recommended by <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, saying the court should accept the settlement intact. <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON> recommended that the court have the right to order the construction or repair of magnet schools and that court forbid the districts from spending settlement money to retire deficits unrelated to desegregation. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said Monday that the districts had no right to challenge the court's jurisdiction because they'd failed to draft a constitutional student assignment plan. `` That the districts would default in their responsibilities, then attempt to bind this court by ` bargaining' with each other as to what remedies the court-appointed expert could or could not use, is incredible,'' he said. `` The parties have bound themselves. There is a settlement.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said his major objection was the North Little Rock and the <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> districts' suggestion that the money could be used to pay off debts. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, however, ruled that the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> district had $ 5.5 million in debts attributed to desegregation that could be paid with settlement money and that the <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district had $ 1.4 million in such debts. The judge refused to grant $ 2.3 million in attorneys' fees the settlement assigned to the Legal Defense Fund of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. He said the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> district should n't pay $ 2 million to the defense fund because the district played the leading role in pressing the lawsuit, no substantial documents or time records were filed to support the claims, and the defense fund tried to recoup fees going back to 1957. In 1957, then-Gov. <PERSON> Orval </PERSON> <PERSON> Faubus </PERSON> refused to allow nine black students to enter <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>'s all-white Central High School. President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> ordered federal troops to Central High to keep the peace and enforce court-ordered desegregation.

<HEAD>Campaigning Ends With Pro-Gov't Rally, Minor Disturbances</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Campaigning for elections to pick a successor to military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> ended late Monday when tens of thousands of supporters held a street rally for pro-government candidate <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. Both supporters and opponents of <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> skirmished briefly with police at the end of the demonstration, and authorities used water cannon to scatter the crowds from downtown streets. There were no reports of injuries or arrests. Chileans vote Thursday for a president and congress to replace the right-wing government of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who has ruled since seizing power in a violent 1973 coup. By law, all campaigning had to end Monday, 48 hours before election day. Supporters of <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, a 40-year-old former finance minister for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, packed several blocks of a downtown avenue on a warm spring night in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> and cheered as the candidate predicted an upset victory. `` We are going to give them a big surprise,'' he told the crowd. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> is considering an underdog to opposition candidate <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, who holds a lead of about 20 percentage points in most pre-election polls. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat who is backed by a coalition of 17 centrist and leftist parties, held his final rally on Sunday, drawing hundreds of thousands of people to the city's biggest park. Police said they had no immediate estimate of the <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> rally turnout, which appeared much smaller than that of <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s campaign chief, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraona </PERSON>, declined to give an estimate In his speech, <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> pledged that if elected `` we will have a real democracy, with a government that will listen to the people.'' He criticized <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s willingness to accept support from leftist groups, and predicted that if <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> wins, the country would return to the social disorder that marked the elected government of former President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist who died during the'73 coup. `` The crucial option in the election is not between left and right, but between moving ahead or moving backwards.'' When the rally ended, participants marched into the center along the main <LOCATION> Bernardo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Higgins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> toward the presidential palace. Police halted their progress blocks away, and used water cannon to disperse them as well as to spray youths who were taunting the <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> supporters. Police have said they would treat both pro- and anti-government elements equally during an election period they said would be free and fair. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was obliged to call the election when he lost a referendum last year on a proposal that he remain in power until 1997. He has vowed to stay on as commander of the country's powerful 60,000-man army after the new government takes power March 11

 <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, the second largest state in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, for the first time demanded Monday that a multiparty political system be set up in this communist country. Until now, the liberal northern state of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> had been the only one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics to openly advocate introduction of Western-style democracy. The Communist leadership of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the most populous state with 42 percent of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million people, vigorously opposes the change. <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> has about 20 percent of the population. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday that it was worried by rising tensions in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and urged the people to unite in support of the reform efforts of Prime Minister Ante <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON>, head of the Croatian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling presidium -LRB- Politburo -RRB-, said Monday that Communists have been slow in realizing the `` historic exhaustion of the single-party system.'' In a keynote speech opening a regional party congress in the Croatian capital of <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON> said, `` There can be no democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the right of association and competition of political -LRB- movements -RRB- and programs.'' The speech was carried by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. About a dozen independent movements and parties have been set up in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> the past year, and the region plans to hold its first free legislative elections next March. About 25,000 Croatians in several cities signed a petition Sunday urging legalization of numerous parties that would make it possible to hold free elections in the Croatian republic, which borders <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. In an apparent move to stifle growing democratic trends in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> this month cut all business and official ties with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. The action shook the foundations of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s loose federal system <PERSON> Stojicevic </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s break with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, describing the consequences as `` dramatic with a possibly catastrophic outcome.'' He said, `` Ultimatums and the severance of economic relations, accusations and threats represent a direct attack on the constitutional order of the country and its economic and political integrity.'' Slovenian President <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> told the region's parliament on Monday that <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s move dealt a `` heavy blow to the Yugoslav federation'' and was meant to `` eliminate all those who hold differing opinions and to produce a change of the constitutional order.' At a session devoted exclusively to the break, <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> told deputies, `` The blockade of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, therefore, represents an act of aggression against <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said when when asked about ethnic problems in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>: `` We are greatly concerned by the growing tensions and conflicts among the republics and national groups that make up <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Mutual respect, adherence to democratic principles, and a commitment to avoiding violence are crucial to resolving this situation. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supports and will continue to support a united federal <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in which human rights and civil rights of all citizens are protected. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strongly supports the ongoing efforts of ... Prime Minister <PERSON> Markovich </PERSON> to create a market-based economy and to promote greater political pluralism. We urge all Yugoslavs to put aside their differences and to focus their energies on this important reform effort.''

<HEAD>Report 7 Inmates Killed, 3 Missing, in Prison Riots Over Amnesty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riots at four prisons, sparked by legislative rejection of an amnesty measure, left at least seven inmates killed, scores of guards injured and extensive damage, authorities reported Monday. They said three prisoners were missing, possibly killed by a fire that swept thorugh a bakery storehouse at the Czarne penitentiary. The riots began late Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> _ lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ turned down a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal to extend the Solidarity-led government's amnesty program to repeat offenders. Solidarity members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> proposed the extended amnesty to give prisoners another chance under the new government. Many Poles protested, fearing a mass release of hardened criminals. The riots were quelled over the weekend when the government authorized the use of force. Some inmates surrendered as police and guards prepared assaults and others gave up as police moved in using tear gas and water cannons, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Col. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swieczynski </PERSON>, a police spokesman, said the law enforcement forces did not use firearms. The worst rioting was at the Czarne prison, in northwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> near the Baltic, which holds 1,500 inmates. Control was regained after a 50-minute battle. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported authorities found the bodies of four prisoners who had been hanged, apparently by fellow inmates, and said two others were killed by bullets. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the prison commander, Capt. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Laminski </PERSON>, had ordered an investigation into the deaths. The burned body of one inmate was found in a fire-gutted cell at the Goleniow prison, also in northern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Goleniow, with 1,000 prisoners, and another prison in the region, Nowogard with 850 inmates, were severely damaged by fires, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Rioting also was suppressed at the <PERSON> Kaminski </PERSON> penitentirary that houses about 1,000 inmates. <PERSON> Laminski </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> that 800 Czarne inmates were transferred to other prisons. All four prisons are maximum security facilities. About 17,000 prisoners were expected to benefit from the amnesty program approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> but it was not applied to those with four or more convictions.

 A 9-year-old girl being airlifted out of mountains for a sprained ankle fell about 30 feet from a helicopter's air-rescue litter, suffering serious head and internal injuries, officials said. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baisa </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition Monday at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> following Saturday's accident just north of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> regained consciousness Monday, said <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Baisa </PERSON>, the girl's grandfather. `` She's doing incredibly well, considering what she's gone through,'' <PERSON> Baisa </PERSON> said. The girl underwent surgery for a broken hip Sunday evening, he said. `` It's her third surgery. ... She already had surgery for her head and internal bleeding.'' <PERSON> Baisa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>'s family plans to pursue an investigation of the accident. `` A sprained ankle turned into a disaster,'' he said. `` We appreciate that emergency workers were trying to help, but somebody did n't do their job right. It should never have happened.'' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> was hiking in the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> Saturday afternoon with her father, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, and cousins when she hurt her ankle. `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> said he tried to carry her down, but it was too steep and it was getting dark, so he sent for help,'' <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Baisa </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> reached <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> and strapped her to a litter but could not carry her down because of the windswept mountain's steepness and the coming darkness, said police Lt. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>. An Army helicopter from <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> was called in to take the girl off the mountain. A medic lowered from the copter checked the airlift litter. But when the helicopter lifted off the ground, the litter began spinning.

 Seeking to silence the debunkers, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> laid out the results of a year's investigation Monday in an attempt to prove that Adm. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> discovered the North Pole exactly where and when he said he had. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, said doubters still willing to dispute <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claim, `` should join the <ORGANIZATION> Flat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The family is vindicated,'' <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> declared. National Geographic President <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said the results of the analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of scientists, should end an 80-year dispute over <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claim. But he said he suspected doubters would persist, as they have for 80 years. The foundation said it had established that the dog sleds led by <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had come at least within five miles of his destination on April 6, 1909 _ close enough to deserve his title as the pole's discoverer But <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> said he remained convinced <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had not gotten within 100 miles of the North Pole. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> is the author of a 1973 book which says <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> perpetuated the greatest scientific hoax of the century. He said the foundation, which conducted the research at the behest and the expense of the <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, had produced a `` whitewash.'' `` Bias can do a lot, and when you want to believe something it is easy to,'' <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> said. `` It is a tragedy for American science.'' At a 95-minute news conference, retired Adm. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, president of the foundation, said <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claims were supported by scientific means. Among these, he said, were a study of the shadows in <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s photographs and of the depth measurements the explorer made by dropping a piece of lead tied to piano wire in holes in the ice Modern maps verify <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s depth soundings, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` Our analysis of the data <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> brought back from his journey _ his celestial sights, his diary, his ocean sounding and his photographs _ has convinced us that their final camp, named <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesup </PERSON>, was no more than five miles from the Pole, allowing for some inaccuracy in their instruments,'' the foundation said in a 240-page report. From the start, <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claim that he and companion <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and four Eskimos reached the pole has been wrapped in controersy. A week before <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> got home, another explorer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, said he had beaten <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> by a year _ a claim that generated inch-high newspaper headlines. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s claim was eventually rejected and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> certified <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> as the discoverer in 1911. But the issue reopened in 1983 when a television docudrama gave the credit to <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Then came <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> with a new claim of proof that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had never made it. He cited a worksheet bearing what he thought were <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s compass readings The foundation investigated and said the numbers were readings from chronometers made on an earlier expedition. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> admitted he was wrong. But on Monday he still insisted that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had missed. The photo analysis cited by <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> used a technique that determines the angle of the elevation of the sun from the shadows in the picture. With knowledge of the dates and times when the pictures were made, the photographer's location can be determined. `` We regard the photogrammetric analysis of the photographs as the most innovative and significant contribution thus far made to the dispute,'' the foundation said. British explorer <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> concluded in 1988 that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had not taken account of westward ice drifts which would have put him 55 or 60 miles away from his destination. But the foundation said its study of Arctic ice drift flows showed that <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> had not taken into account a subsequent rapid eastward movement of the ice.

<HEAD>Study Says Fears Over Foreign Investment in U.S. Unwarranted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, banks and other businesses has escalated in recent years, but most fears about adverse economic consequences from foreign control are unwarranted, concludes a study released Monday by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research group. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> said that, contrary to some arguments, the growth of foreign ownership has not translated into a loss of jobs for Americans and that foreign-owned firms paid their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers the same as domestic firms. The institute argued against changing any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws to block foreign investment, saying that even in the area of national security the growth of foreign ownership was not of concern. `` Even with the recent growth in foreign ownership, foreign firms play a smaller role in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy than in the Canadian and major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> economies,'' wrote the authors of the report, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a business professor at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The study said that foreign firms accounted for 7 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment in manufacturing in 1986 compared to 21 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 14 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 13 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. By contrast, foreign-owned firms employed only 1 percent of manufacturing workers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a country with a tradition of making foreign investment difficult. `` If one country invests heavily in another country, which country has given the most hostages?'' <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> asked at a news conference where the report was released. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is going to find that it has a very great stake in what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government decides when it discovers that it has a rather large part of its national wealth invested inside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. borders.'' The new report, `` Foreign Direct Investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' analyzed the rapid growth in foreign direct investment. To count as foreign ownership, the foreign firm must own at least 10 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business. The heavy purchases by foreigners, in particular the Japanese, have triggered concern in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is selling off its economic destiny to foreigners. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that foreign direct investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate and businesses totaled $ 328.9 billion in 1988, the first year that foreign direct ownership in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> surpassed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ownership overseas, which totaled $ 326.9 billion. While <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> continued as the country with the largest stake in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, holding 31 percent of total foreign-held assets, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> climbed into the No. 2 spot with 16.2 percent of the total, ahead of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, which held 14.9 percent. While purchases of prime real estate and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie studios by the Japanese grabbed the headlines, the most dramatic inroads by the Japanese have come in banking, according to the institute's study It reported that the Japanese in 1988 controlled 52.2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banking assets held by foreign banks, far ahead of the second biggest foreign holder, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which controls 7.1 percent. The institute said that growing foreign leadership in high-technology industries posed new problems in meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military needs. As a partial solution, the study proposed making it mandatory for foreign companies making sales to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to establish manufacturing plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit research institute created in 1981 through a grant from the German Marshall Fund of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an independent endowment created by the West German government. It now receives 15 percent of its funds from the German Marshall Fund with other resources coming from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foundations including the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Flora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hewlitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> CZECHOSLOVAKIA </LOCATION> _ A ringing of bells and car horns heralded a popular victory over the Communists, and Czechoslovaks settled down to choosing a president from among heroes the old order called villains. A presidential contest appeared to be developing, and the people may get to decide. The brief blast of noise replaced a threatened general strike, canceled after events brought to power the first government in 41 years not dominated by Communists and drove President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> from office. `` This is the end of communism!'' exulted <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Navara </PERSON>, an actress in pink mukluks.

 EAST <LOCATION> GERMANY </LOCATION> _ More than 150,000 people rallied for democracy in this southern industrial city, with shouting matches erupting for a fourth straight week over whether <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should reunite. ADN, the official news agency, said 40,000 people demonstrated at <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> for a referendum on reunification before elections planned in May. It said the crowd also demanded that cells of the discredited <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> be disbanded by Dec. 15. Other rallies took place in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Halle </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, the agency reported. It said the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> crowd also divided on the reunification issue.

 <LOCATION> HUNGARY </LOCATION> _ Three Hungarian journalists who went to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> last week to meet a dissident clergyman were detained by police, expelled from the country and banned from re-entering for five years, it was reported. Police also confiscated their film and videocassettes. <PERSON> Szilvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Izso </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION>, the official newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and two other reporters of a regional newspaper went to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Thursday to interview <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> clergyman <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toekes </PERSON>, who has been harassed for his criticism of human rights violations in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> POLAND </LOCATION> _ Riots at four prisons involving legislative rejection of an amnesty measure left at least seven inmates killed, scores of guards injured and extensive damage, authorities reported. They said three prisoners were missing, possibly killed by a fire that swept through a bakery storehouse at the Czarne penitentiary. The riots began Thursday after the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> turned down a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal to extend the Solidarity-led government's amnesty program to repeat offenders. Also, authorities in the southern steel town of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> have quietly removed a statue of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> that youthful demonstrators have repeatedly defaced and tried to destroy.

 <LOCATION> SOVIET </LOCATION> <LOCATION> UNION </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> clashed with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conservatives at a tense, 10-hour <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting that included an especially harsh personal attack, according to accounts. When the doors opened Saturday, however, the 58-year-old Kremlin leader emerged `` in excellent shape,'' a participant said. A two-hour general strike called by human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> appeared to fizzle, with only 1,500 participants reported in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and scattered support around the country.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Richardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> was resentenced Tuesday to four years in federal prison and fined $ 10,000 for witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice. <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>, who served as governor of this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1986, was convicted in 1987 of 10 counts and sentenced to nine years in prison for allegedly exchanging political favors for payoffs, but a federal appeals court last year reversed eight of those counts and set aside the sentence. <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>, who turned 62 on Monday, will pay his own way to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland and report to the federal prison, once the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> has made an assignment, said <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, of the federal probation office here, said notification of where <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> is to report could come in as little as two weeks. <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>, who met briefly with supporters outside the courtroom but declined to talk to reporters, remains free on his own recognizance. During his trial, federal proseuctors said <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> approved government contracts and permits for various firms in exchange for payments, mostly delivered to him in unmarked envelopes. The money was described by the donors as campaign contributions or gifts, but never was reported by <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> in his campaign statements, authorities said. He also was accused of approving a $ 103,000 government contract for a company that agreed to hire his campaign manager. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said four bribery-realted convictions were reversed because the federal crime of bribery applies only to state officials and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> is a territory. It said four extortion-related convictions were reversed because the jury was not told it must find <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> demanded or otherwise inducted the payoffs, totaling $ 79,600 in cash.

<TEXT>
 A Canadian naval destroyer Monday fired a shot across the bow of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> scalloper that allegedly rammed it three times, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The 366-foot destroyer Sagueny fired a 3-inch round at 6:52 p.m. near <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after chasing the 114-foot scalloper <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> for eight hours, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. The Concordia did not stop or attempt to make radio contact after the warning shot was fired, said <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. She said the vessel continued to steam west towards <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and its home port of <LOCATION> Fairhaven </LOCATION>. The Sagueny followed it until 8:50 p.m., when it entered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters. The scalloper was allegedly spotted fishing 2.5 miles across the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION> fisheries line by a Canadian aircraft, said <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. The Hague line divides <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian waters was established by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. There have been several reports this year of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> fishing boats crossing the line to the rich fishing area on the Canadian side. Lt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Maybee </PERSON>, a Canadian Forces spokesman, said the <PERSON> Sagueny </PERSON> began tracking the <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> after it was spotted fishing in Canadian waters on five occasions during the weekend. The smaller boat allegedly disregarded radio messages before it `` eventually turned toward <LOCATION> Sagueny </LOCATION> and stuck the right rear quarter three times,'' <PERSON> Maybee </PERSON> said. No injuries or serious damage were reported. `` Options are being weighed by the political masters in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> as to what the next step should be,'' he said. `` It is all-important that a knee-jerk reaction be avoided.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was expected to board the craft when it reached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. `` We will document the vessel's catch, check charts and records, and varify the identities of the master and crew,'' she said <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to proceed to its home port after the boarding was completed, and any further action would have to be initiated by the Canadian government. <PERSON> Maybee </PERSON> declined to detail what kind of punitive action could be taken in the alleged ramming about 130 miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had no plans to intervene, adding, `` Canadian ships do n't usually pursue the American fishing fleet inside American waters unless they get permission from diplomatic channels.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been monitoring the situation, abiding its policy of not interfering with Canadian law enforcement.''

<TEXT>
 A chartered jetliner carrying 51 Vietnamese, their dreams of starting a new life abroad shattered by their expulsion from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, landed in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> early Tuesday. They were the first Vietnamese boat people to be repatriated against their will by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Some screamed for help as they were taken from camp. Government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> reported the Cathay Pacific Tri-star landed at the Vietnamese capital without incident. It quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying thousands more Vietnamese living in refugee camps in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will be returned home within weeks. About 56,000 Vietnamese who arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> by boat are held in squalid camps. Nearly 44,000 are considered illegal immigrants and are to be sent home unless they can prove persecution awaits them. The Tri-star left this British colony at 5:09 a.m., two hours after riot police entered a detention center, removed the Vietnamese and took them to the the airport under tight security and cover of darkness. Put on the plane were eight Vietnamese men, 17 women and 26 children, a government spokeswoman said, insisting on anonymity. `` Repatriation has taken place. Everything went smoothly.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the international human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> condemned the repatriation and appealed to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and the governor of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to halt it. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> early Tuesday would said only that the first involuntary repatriations passed off without difficulty. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> is to make a statement on the issue in the Commons later Tuesday. On Monday, visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reservations about the repatriations during a meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at her official 10 Downing St. residence. Some Vietnamese shrieked for help from windows of the detention camp as the operation began at 3 a.m. Others held signs through the metal bars that said: `` Where is your humanity?'' Police equipped with helmets, shields, revolvers and batons quickly pulled them away. `` I do n't want to go back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>!'' a woman shouted in broken Cantonese, the dialect of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, waving her hands in despair. A convoy of police vans took the Vietnamese from the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> detention center to the airport. Some boat people cried as they were taken away; others waved at reporters. About 175 police and corrections officers were involved, outnumbering the Vietnamese at least 3-1. Reporters saw no evidence of violence. What appeared to be the same vans later pulled up to the jet on the airport tarmac, but reporters watching from the roof of a nearby building could not see people boarding. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argues that conditions first must improve inside the Communist country before there is repatriation. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> claims the program is necessary to deter more boat people from fleeing to overcrowded <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, about 600 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> quoted a Vietnamese official as saying <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> would insist force not be used and would accept only those who did not resist repatriation. According to the radio report, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed more people must be repatriated than the 636 who returned voluntarily. It quoted the official as saying those returning would not be punished. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees monitors the boat people who have returned voluntarily but has refused to take part in the forced repatriation. So far, nearly 6,800 Vietnamese screened by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> immigration officials have been rejected as refugees. In 1988, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> decided to treat arriving boat people as illegal immigrants as a means of stopping the mass influx. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> officials said the Vietnamese were arriving much faster than they could be resettled overseas and most were fleeing poverty, not persecution. Boat people continued to arrive, more than 34,000 from Jan. 1 to Nov. 10. Officials say it is important to begin the involuntary repatriation before the next sailing season in the spring. Opponents of forced repatriation argued it could trigger violence in the detention centers and lead some to try suicide. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government spokeswoman said that as of early Tuesday she had received no reports of trouble at the camps.

 A young <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> actress apparently defected shortly before her children's theater troupe went home Monday after performing as part of an exchange program with a local group, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> theater official said. <PERSON> Larisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON> of the Central Children's Theatre of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did n't show up Monday morning as 34 members of the 46-member troupe assembled at their hotel to head for the airport, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, executive director of the Children's Theater Company of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` It was quite a surprise,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials told him that <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON>, a 24-year-old apprentice actress, had gone to them in the middle of the night and that they took her to talk to Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials. He said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials would n't allow anyone to talk to her. `` We have no sense of what her status is. They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- made it clear they do n't know, either,'' said <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, adding that he could assume only that <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON> has defected. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment, and there was no answer at the local <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said he had no indication that <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON>, who appeared to be happy, would defect. The actress has a husband in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Firsova </PERSON> had one of the chorus roles in `` Dream To Be Continued,'' which finished its eight-performance run Sunday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on Monday challenged a report that the Guard intentionally counted no-show troops to get more federal money, and said it is clearing out its deadwood. `` We take sharp exception to this,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutschera </PERSON> said following Monday's report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` To imply that this is a sham or conscious effort to mislead the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is n't borne out by the facts.'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Villano </PERSON>, said, `` The state inspector general is looking at it and because of this pending investigation it would be inappropriate for us to comment any further.'' <PERSON> Villano </PERSON> said other investigations had been conducted. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said no-show soldiers had been kept on the Guard's rosters for at least six years, giving the Pentagon the false impression that the Guard is ready for war or national disaster <PERSON> Kutschera </PERSON> said he was particularly disturbed by the assertion that the Guard was not prepared for war, and said a `` vast number'' had been judged to be combat-ready. Asked how many units were combat-ready, he replied, `` That's very close to being classified information. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s budget has tripled to $ 390 million a year since 1975 despite having the second worst attendance record in the nation. The newspaper said it determined that <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, Guard commander from 1975 to 1986, created a phantom force in 1984. <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, who reportedly retired under pressure, was released from prison in July after serving a year for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a defunct defense contractor. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said a high-ranking Guard official who asked not to be further identified said he followed <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>'s orders to list 2,500 phantom soldiers on the roster. The Post, citing a confidential draft report prepared for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>, also said <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> admitted to prosecutors two years ago that he put phantom soldiers on the Guard's roster. There was no answer at a suburban telephone listed under <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>'s name. His former attorney, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberling </PERSON>, no longer practices law and did not know how to reach <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said 1,600 to 4,000 no-show <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> soldiers remain absent without leave and should be dismissed. No-shows are not paid, but the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> provides funds for their equipment and training. <PERSON> Kutscher </PERSON> said that was not true. `` Federal money for equipment allocated to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is not based on drill attendance but on the authorized level of equipment in the organization itself,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should repeal its `` odious'' 1975 resolution that equates Zionism with racism in an effort to promote the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. He also gave Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> a check for $ 65 million in partial payment of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears, an issue that has stirred anti-U.S. sentiment here. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now owes $ 365 million for the regular budget and $ 153 million for peacekeeping. `` Repealing this resolution would re-establish the stature and moral authority of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters after a 50-minute meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. `` Now is the time to begin discussion on substituting or getting rid of this odious resolution which equates Zionism with racism.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s comments came in answer to questions. The resolution is symbolic and not binding, but has been a sore point with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its ally, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomats said that killing the resolution, or declaring it null and void, could enhance the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process by removing an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> objection to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> involvement. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution was backed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rivals, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and much of the movement professing non-alignment with either superpower. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said it `` should be declared null and void.'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, spokesman for the secretary-general, later said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief had no comment. `` It is up to the member states and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to decide,'' he told reporters at a daily briefing. He said no resolution has ever been rescinded or repealed, but that the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> `` can innovate if it wishes to do so.'' Resolutions are part of the permanent record and can not be repealed or erased, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats said. However, substitute resolutions can be presented and previous resolutions, by a majority vote, can be declared void and no longer representative of the majority's sentiments. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries `` can be very helpful'' in the matter of repeal. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> changed its traditional vote this year and for the first time supported accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s credentials in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked how repeal would promote Palestinian rights. He said that renouncing the resolution would help human rights in the occupied territories and send a positive signal about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters he had `` a very good and candid discussion'' with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief on a number of issues, including the U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, allegations of Cuban violations of human rights, forthcoming Nicaraguan elections and the Central American peace process. He said he briefed <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting. He said he told him `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is becoming more isolated.'' He said Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s criticism of perestroika, or reform, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` is an indirect criticism of Soviet President -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week suffered a setback on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues after it threatened to cut off all funding to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the world body upgraded the status of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as an observer state, instead of an observer group. The issue was defused and the question was put off, but anti-U.S. sentiment remains. The General Assembly later adopted a package of pro-PLO, anti-Israel resolutions _ an annual event.

 An opposition campaign rally turned into a riot in which one person was reported killed and more than 20 people injured. Foreign observers blamed the violence on Sandinista provocateurs.

 A troubled musical that never made it to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> is getting a second chance in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, counting on the <LOCATION> Midas </LOCATION> touch of director <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has made international hits out of `` Cats,'' `` Starlight Express'' and `` Les Miserables.'' Now he has turned his attention to `` The <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s Wife,'' an American show which closed on the road over a decade ago and has yet to be seen on Broadway. `` I really do think it can give pleasure; I know that it can work,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> during rehearsals before the show opened Nov. 27 to mixed reviews. Based on <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagnol </PERSON>'s 1938 French film `` La Femme du Boulanger,'' with music and lyrics by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pippin,'' `` Godspell'' -RRB- and a book by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> -LRB- `` Fiddler on the Roof'' -RRB-, the musical is playing at the Phoenix Theater. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, plays the eponymous baker's wife, an adulterous young bride in 1930s <LOCATION> Provence </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alun </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, the original innkeeper Thenardier in `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' is the cuckolded French baker, and <PERSON> Drue </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> plays the proverbial other man. The original production, starring <PERSON> Topol </PERSON> in his American stage debut, opened in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the summer of 1976. By the time it closed in November at The <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, it had been through so many rewrites, directors and cast changes that its creators forbade the show to move to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. It was meant to open at the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> Theater the week of Nov. 15 as then-producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>'s 90th Broadway show. `` By that time, we felt the show was not ours any longer,'' recalled <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. `` Traumatic is a little too strong a word; it was a painful experience. `` The show we are now opening is very much the show we had hoped to have originally.'' The 77-year-old <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> added that it has affinities to his two biggest hits, `` Fiddler on the Roof'' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- and `` Zorba'' -LRB- 1968 -RRB-. `` It's about how an experience of some people in a village changes the community,'' said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, whose last Broadway show was the ill-fated 1986 `` Rags,'' with <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratas </PERSON>. `` It's like ` Fiddler' and ` Zorba' in that this is a community of very simple, rather rudimentary people with elementary passions both comedic and serious.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said both <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> had to be talked into reapproaching their show: `` It was a wound they did n't necessarily want to reopen, and therefore being true to the material has been the most important task. `` I felt if ever <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> thought again that those people presenting the show were being random, were being panicked, were concerned with results rather than intentions, then their hearts would be broken.'' His company, <ORGANIZATION> Homevale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, has an undisclosed investment in the production, as does Broadway producer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nederlander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> first encountered the music from `` The Baker's Wife'' at Broadway auditions for `` Cats'' in 1982. He heard it again three years later at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auditions for `` Starlight Express'' and `` Les Miserables.'' The show was recorded privately following its pre-Broadway run, with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorvino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> singing the main roles. Its best-known number, the lilting `` Meadowlark,'' is featured on <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>'s new album `` The Songs That Got Away.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> acknowledged `` The Baker's Wife'' marks a change from his past spectaculars. `` It's a traditional Broadway book musical... I myself hugely enjoy that moment where music enters, and there's a frisson, a wonderful tingle.'' The director has staged two other <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shows this year: <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s musical `` Aspects of Love,'' and <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Othello,'' with <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> `` Aspects of Love'' is scheduled to open April 3 on Broadway, but <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> feels it's too early to say whether `` The Baker's Wife'' will follow suit. `` The show has a wonderful community feel,'' he said, `` but that's not at all the same as the considerations that come in to doing something on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> where everyone says, ` Yeah, but is it new? Is it revolutionary? Is it the talk of the town?'''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rasheed </PERSON> <PERSON> Araeen </PERSON> was shocked to find nearly 1,400 years of Islamic civilization reduced to two pages in `` The Story of Art,'' a standard English textbook. So the Pakistan-born sculptor organized the first exhibition of exclusively black and Asian immigrant art ever to be shown at a major <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> gallery. Called `` The Other Story: Afro-Asian Artists in <LOCATION> Post-War </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' the exhibition opened Nov. 30 at the <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, featuring the work of 24 artists from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. Three are the British-born children of immigrants. <PERSON> Araeen </PERSON>, 54, came to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1964 as a civil engineer and became a full-time sculptor four years later. He won his first prize in 1969. He sees the show at the <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, which runs through Feb. 4, as a triumph. `` It was a hard struggle to put it on. I have been trying for 11 years,'' he said in an interview. In 1978, he first took the idea to the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes government subsidies for the arts and helps fund the Hayward Gallery. They said the time was n't right. `` I kept pestering them,'' <PERSON> Araeen </PERSON> said. `` I went back in 1982 and they still said no. Two years later my autobiography, ` Making Myself Visible,' was published, and in 1987 I started bringing out a journal of our art called Third Text. I think all that helped, as well as getting work into exhibitions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad. `` It takes time to understand _ perhaps they needed the time. Government policy has changed.'' The show is vivid and colorful, but some themes, such as racism, usually arent' t shown in exhibits that make it to the mainstream <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Some exhibits are funny. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in his participation art, invites visitors to remove magnets from revolving metal plates and reposition them. <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> lines up 11 rat traps which have `` caught'' torn-up pieces of reproductions of paintings and calls the work `` In Search of an Ideal Landscape.'' The most striking exhibit is a 5-foot-tall elmwood carving of a male head and torso by the late <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, a Jamaican who used the wood's natural whorls to emphasize the parts of the face and body. <PERSON> Araeen </PERSON> insists the immigrants' work is not inherently different from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> art. `` It was our inspiration to be part of something global. We do n't want separation of cultures,'' he said. The catalog prints the first-ever chronology of immigrant art in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, starting from 1941 and interspersed with incidents of racism. It accuses British dealers and exhibition organizers of neglecting non-British artists. However, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, the toughest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> art critics, wrote in the Sunday Times that the immigrant artists' work is largely ignored by critics and dealers because it is `` not good enough.'' <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> felt the artists are influenced by Western imagery, and if they wish `` to be seen as a match for the English whites whom <PERSON> Araeen </PERSON> derides as privileged, then he should relish the competition and comparison inevitable in a mixed exhibition.'' Says Araeen: `` There are 14 million non-Europeans in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> now, compared to not even 1 million before World War II. Decolonization has led to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, for example, producing high-caliber scientists, doctors and engineers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, so why not artists? They, too, look for places to fulfill their ambitions and develop their ideas. It's not easy to do that in poverty. `` Racism exists _ it functions at all levels. If there is discrimination in jobs there is in art as well.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, deputy director of the <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said the work belongs to British contemporary art and is part of the history of art in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Prices of the works on show run from $ 150 to $ 47,000.

The one-hour show on Wednesday tells the story of an internationally famous photographer who reflects on his life and uses the opportunity to heal the wounds between himself and his son. The son felt his father had always put his career ahead of his family. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, although best known as a singer and actor, is also an acclaimed photographer and recently patched up relations with his own son, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who co-stars in the special as the son. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> are also in the show. `` We sent him the script to read,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON>, who co-wrote the show with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON>. `` I was delighted when I learned he was not only a photographer but a good photographer. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> felt he had neglected his own son and had an estrangement.'' <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON> said, `` I think the feeling of the film is one of healing and coming together, which was reflected in <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s own relationship with his son.'' When the project got under way <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON> were asked to come up with a story about four periods in a man's life. `` Don and I came up with the idea of making him a photographer,'' said <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON>. `` That way we could use photos to introduce each period. The first period is childhood, when he becomes interested in photography. The next is young manhood, when he goes off to war and falls in love. Act three is his marriage and family and the development of his career and the conflicts it causes in his personal life. `` The last act is about maturity and reconciliation. It's about regeneration, which is so appropriate for this time of year. An area <PERSON> Don </PERSON> and I wanted to explore is something that is common to all of us in this society. That's the work ethic and how it can cause a man to neglect his family.'' <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> said he also felt at ease with <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> when he learned that he's a fisherman. <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> fished the streams of his native <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for many years before discovering salmon fishing. `` I fish in British <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> now,'' he said. `` I caught a 50-pound fish up there last year. That's a lifetime fish. They canned it for me and the cans arrived just yesterday.'' This is the first collaboration between <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON>, best known for creating `` The Waltons'' and `` Falcon Crest,'' and <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON>, a former entertainment executive and a published novelist. `` We've known each other a long time,'' said <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON>. `` We always discussed writing because we both write. We both collect books and when we meet for lunch we arrange it near a book store. After lunch we'll go and browse for a while. I collect literature and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> collects Americana.'' <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> said, `` My dream is to find a rare book and buy it for $ 7.50. But the book store people all know the value of these books.'' Their next collaboration will be `` <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>,'' a half-hour drama for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> starring <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>. It will be filmed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where her talk show is based, and will make its debut in April. They are also working on several cable television projects and wrote a pilot last year for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Brewster Place'' is adapted from the book `` The Women of Brewster Place'' and the miniseries that ran on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON> are making some changes in the concept because the miniseries presented such a negative image of black men. `` We'll have much more positive images,'' said <PERSON> Sipes </PERSON>. `` We're adding some new characters <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> will play her character in her late 40s. She'll have to be aged and padded for the part.'' <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> said he feels the television audience wants the kind of family programming represented by `` Christmas in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` The networks want people between 18 and 49,'' he said. `` You cut out a lot of people that way. Suppose you do a ` once upon a time' story. You can attract the 18-49 audience and everyone else, too.''

<HEAD>Canadian Socialists Select First Female Party Leader in Canada</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The socialist New Democrats have become the first of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s three national political parties to choose a female leader, hoping some new vitality can produce a long-sought breakthrough to high office. <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who chose <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> singer <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s `` Talking ` bout a Revolution'' as her theme song at the party's convention this month, was elected leader on the `` I stand for change,'' she said. `` I want to change <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>... Let's seize the future and not the past.'' The 53-year-old latecomer to federal politics from the sparsely populated <PERSON> Yukon </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, who retired after 14 years as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His credibility and personal popularity had brought hopes for significant gains before the November 1988 national election, but the hopes failed to materialize. Even so, a Gallup poll taken two months before the convention in <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>, found that 47 percent of Canadians believed the New Democrats would be hurt by losing <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> as leader. Twenty percent said his departure would help the party and 15 percent said it would have no effect. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> delivered a farewell speech that listed policies he said would be in keeping with the party's social democratic tradition. Among them were an end to child poverty, a softening of what he called the market economy's harsh impact, a diversion of military spending to aid for the Third World and a tougher approach to environmental protection that would include jail sentences for polluters. The way was clear for a newcomer after some of the party's best known figures declined to run for the leadership post. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> was the only woman among seven hopefuls. She has provided few specifics of what direction she will take as party leader, speaking simply of a new vision and new approach to the political process. She has blamed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for most of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s current problems and said the party will oppose it again in the next national election, which is some three years away. The trade pact, opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as well as the New Democrats, took effect last Jan. 1 after the hard-fought election returned Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for a second consecutive majority government. The Conservatives won 43 percent of the popular vote, the Liberals 32 percent and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 20 percent, enough for a record 43 of the 295 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. But the popular vote level for the party, known as the <ORGANIZATION> NDP </ORGANIZATION>, did n't increase from past performances. The New Democrats' strength has been in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the party failed to make a much heralded national breakthrough into French-speaking <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and remained of limited appeal in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal provinces <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> was born and grew up near <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. She separated from her husband in the early part of the 1970s and her two children were old enough to be on their own by 1979. In what is becoming a much told story in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, she bought a truck that year and headed north to settle in the Yukon. Her earlier career had been in social work, and she worked in <LOCATION> Whitehorse </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Yukon </PERSON>'s capital, as a consultant on social policy development. She also worked as an <ORGANIZATION> NDP </ORGANIZATION> organizer and policy adviser. She became nationally known after winning a 1987 race for the <PERSON> Yukon </PERSON>'s one seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, a seat that had been held by a Progressive Conservative for the previous 30 years. Although some skepticism has been heard in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> about whether the present moment in world history is a time for revitalizing a social <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s declining popularity in opinion polls indicates plenty of room for opposing viewpoints. A Gallup poll released Nov. 23 found that 26 percent of Canadians would vote for the Progressive Conservatives if an election were held now, 25 percent for the New Democrats and 42 percent for the Liberals. Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, whose opposition to the free trade pact helped revitalize his party, is stepping down and a successor will be chosen in June. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> studied French as part of her preparations for the <ORGANIZATION> NDP </ORGANIZATION> leadership race and used her speaking appearances at the convention to show an acceptable accent if limited fluency. Her comments were considered an attempt to show that the party remains seriously interested in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Britain's Moslems Split over Response to `The Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Moslem leaders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agree <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> blasphemed their religion in his book, `` The Satanic Verses,'' but they differ sharply on what to do about it. One noted Moslem figure, <PERSON> Hesham </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON>, said he wanted to go to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and win a reprieve for the author, but after a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper said `` the hanging rope'' awaited him, he stayed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A prominent Moslem, <PERSON> Kalim </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, supports the death sentence imposed on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by the late Iranian leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, and thinks <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should be hounded perpetually until his book, published 14 months ago, is withdrawn from bookshelves. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a Bombay-born Moslem, has been in hiding under police guard since Feb. 14. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on June 3, but his edict endures. <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s edict is unchallengeable and that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> got `` nothing less than he thoroughly deserved. But while favoring the death decree `` absolutely,'' he says it is `` not for Moslems living in this country to break British law to bring <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to book.'' El-Essawy, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tolerance </ORGANIZATION>, contends that the death sentence contradicts the Koran's teachings. `` As a Moslem, I should really suppress the human response and adopt the religious response, which is, ` Do n't punish him; leave him to God to punish or forgive him as He wishes,''' <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> said in an interview. He planned a lecture tour of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states in February to dispute <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s edict but canceled it when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> declined to guarantee his safety and its semi-official newspaper, <PERSON> Kehan </PERSON>, warned he would be hanged. `` The death sentence is really a slur, is something that defames the religion of Islam,'' El-Essawy maintained. `` As long as the man stays in hiding, we'll stand accused of putting him there and keeping him there. We'll be regarded as potential killers.'' <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> said he hoped at least to remove the $ 5.2-million bounty offered by Iranian clerics for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s assassination, by designating it `` the tactics of gangsters and not worthy of the Islamic republic.'' El-Essawy and <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> have never met. <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON>'s group seeks to identify and correct causes of intolerance toward Moslems. <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>'s disseminates information on Moslem political thought. <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, came to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1954; <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1970. Both are married with three children and both are thoroughly Westernized in appearance. They share an easy humor and a mutual contempt. In a book-lined study at his house in suburban <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, 58, dismissed <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> as an apologist. `` Totally idiotic the man is, to put it mildly,'' he said. <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON>, 43, seated in his ornamented dentist's office in <LOCATION> Harley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s medical row, said <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>'s speeches verge on `` incitement to murder, but do n't let me be the judge.'' In October, at a Moslem rally in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> called for a show of hands on whether the death sentence was just and virtually all 250 people in the audience were reported to have raised their hands. A BBC-TV poll published the previous night indicated only 35 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 2 million Moslems were in favor of the death penalty. Police are investigating whether <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> was guilty of incitement and have obtained a court order forcing the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> to hand over its footage of the rally. <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> complains the British media portray him `` as a sort of rabble rouser _ the opposite to <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, as it were.'' He says Moslems have no choice but to protest and show that `` anyone who tries to go down the same road as Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> in the future will be dealt with much more severely.'' <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> wants <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers, <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON>, to withdraw the book and that profits from the 1.2 million copies sold should be shared among relatives of 26 people who died in anti-Rushdie riots in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` They should make amends, and then we'll call it a day,'' <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON> said. Otherwise, `` this is going to be an issue in 50 years from now.'' <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> said: `` There is not one single Moslem who is not angered by the book.'' But he thinks <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> might defuse the furor by affixing labels to his book making clear the contents are fictional. He said he met <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> on a train two weeks before the author was driven into hiding and suggested the disclaimer label, but <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> rejected it as tantamount to `` an apology.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is `` not showing any good will at all,'' <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> added. `` In fact, he's doing the opposite _ he's trying to promote the campaign against him ... because he wants to sell more books.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 42, continues to write, and occasionally aims barbed comments at his opponents. In a book review he wrote recently for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supplement </ORGANIZATION>, he alluded to the public burning of his book by Moslems with this thought: `` To burn a book is not to destroy it. One minute of darkness will not make us blind.''

<HEAD>State-run Schools Still Off-limits to South African Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While the government pursues racial reform on several other fronts, rigid apartheid remains the rule at state-run schools, despite a growing clamor for change. For millions of black children, schools are overcrowded or unavailable. Scores of white schools have closed because of pupil shortages. Yet the government recently rebuffed a coalition of white parents, teachers and students who petitioned to establish <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s first multiracial public school. `` Amid all his encouraging moves ... President <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has just failed an acid test,'' said The Star, the country's largest daily newspaper. `` No matter how compelling the reasons to amend that archaic policy, no matter how desperate the pleas from those affected, apartheid remains alive and kicking in the school system.'' Since taking office in mid-August, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> repeatedly has vowed to eliminate racial discrimination. Yet his support for segregated state schools is unwavering despite official figures indicating that the government spends nearly five times as much to educate a white pupil as a black one. According to the minister in charge of white education, <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clase </PERSON>, school segregation is essential to ensure `` cultural and linguistic continuity'' between the home and the classroom.'' The `` acid test'' referred to by The Star was the fate of <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a 102-year-old institution the government targeted for closure because of declining enrollment. A substantial majority of the teachers, students and parents launched an unprecedented campaign to save the whites-only school by opening it to children of the thousands of black, mixed-race and Indian families who have moved into the inner-city neighborhood in defiance of residential segregation laws. After hinting that it might allow a experimental multiracial public school, the government decided instead on a compromise. It would allow the high school to remain in operation, but only as a private school. The state will provide a subsidy of up to 45 percent of its operating costs, but even so, few of the current pupils are expected to able to afford the projected monthly fees of 100 rand -LRB- $ 38 -RRB-. The school also is expected to lose two of its five grades because of financial constraints and will be able to cater to no more than 240 pupils, although the facility has a capacity of nearly 700. `` The creation of a private school is no victory as far as I am concerned,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McGurk </PERSON>, a member of a provisional board of trustees for the new school. `` The new school will have nothing to do with the old.'' <PERSON> McGurk </PERSON>, the principal of a multiracial Roman Catholic school, said the government tends to lower its subsidies to private schools with relatively high proportions of black pupils. `` The state has a natural temptation to mobilize as much resources as possible for whites,'' he said. The government currently spends the equivalent of about $ 800 a year to educate a white child, compared to less than $ 200 per black child. This gap has been reduced from previous years, but the government recently abandoned a 10-year plan to equalize the per-capita education spending. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the largest black township with an estimated 2.5 million residents, schools have been plagued by violence, severe overcrowding, shortages of textbooks, poor performances on exams and deteriorating facilities. In many Soweto schools, there are 40 to 50 pupils for each teacher. The South African Institute of Race Relations reported in November that 196 white schools have been closed in the past 10 years, and that remaining white schools have more than 250,000 vacant places. An estimated 1 million black children have no schools to go to, the institute said. A handful of the closed-down white schools have been made available to the education departments for Indians and mixed-race people, but most have been leased to other government agencies and 42 are unused, said the institute, an independent research organization. `` Given the crying need for school places for black pupils, this is a criminal waste of a high order,'' said a recent editorial in The Star. The campaign to integrate <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has been emulated in other cities, under the banner of a group called All Schools for All People. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Moonda </PERSON>, a leader of the group, said that if the state does not act, a defiance campaign will be launched next year in which parents will take their children to the nearest school and demand enrollment. `` We do not want to cause disruptions, but we may be forced to,'' he said. `` The state is simply fostering illiteracy among our kids.''

<HEAD>Politicians Plot Greater Safety in Numbers on Risky Votes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a political system that is supposed to thrive on competition, there's something odd happening. Politicians are starting to suggest the only way to deal with really tough issues is under a cease-fire, a truce in which they would agree to put unpopular votes out of campaign bounds. One Republican leader called it a `` suicide pact,'' and said that may be what it takes to get action to rein some politically sacrosanct spending programs _ Social Security and veterans benefits were two he mentioned. The political parties already have put one such deal into effect, agreeing that Republicans and Democrats will speak no campaign evil of each other for supporting the two-step pay raise the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted itself just before adjourning. House leaders of both parties insisted on that pledge before the vote on salaries and a 1991 ban on honoraria, finding at last a way around the political perils that have gone with raises in congressional pay for 200 years. So the chairmen of the national and congressional campaign committees agreed the pay vote `` is not an appropriate point of criticism in the coming campaigns.'' That will be fine with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> memers who voted for the raise; dissenters and challengers who try to make it an issue will risk losing the financial and technical support they could otherwise expect from the national campaign committees. With that deal cut, other topics may start to look inviting as prospects for non-aggression pacts. That idea and some variations on the theme came up last week at a forum on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990s, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In theory, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political system and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself should work best with ideas, issues, candidates and officeholders competing in contests that produce winners, force compromise and ultimately shape consensus. Former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> argued that side of the case at the <ORGANIZATION> AEI </ORGANIZATION> forum, saying it can work between the branches as well as between the parties. `` A little conflict can bring out the best,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader who went to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and vetoed bills at a record pace, 67 of them in 2 -LCB- years. `` I'm not sure that confrontation between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is necessarily bad.'' As for political competition, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said if he had the power to draw congressional district lines, each of them would be as closely divided as possible, with party registration split no more widely than 60 percent to 40 percent for the minority. But Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, chairman of the Democratic conference, said congressmen from closely divided districts are the most skittish on controversial votes. He said members with politically safe districts may be in better shape to make the correct but unpopular decisions that sometimes come to a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> whip who quit the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, said professional, aggressive congressional campaign committees in both parties tend to make members nervous about becoming a target over a potentially unpopular vote. `` It's very organized, very controlled,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` I was part of it, I recognize it.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip, said that's why members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> back away from such risky positions as limiting Social Security benefit increases in order to chip away at the federal deficit. Republicans tried in 1982 and got creamed, he said. `` Who the hell is going to do the heavy lifting?'' he said. All sides acknowledge it will take unpopular votes to make real reductions in the federal deficit. `` Nobody gets elected saying no,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. `` You get elected saying yes. It was <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> who suggested that a political truce might be a way to get things done, by taking the sting and risk out of votes to cut votes to cut popular spending programs. `` We ought to sit down and do the suicide pact,'' he said, agreeing members in both parties will `` go over the cliff together'' and wo n't try to punish each other later. `` It does n't take courage if we all do it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airport on Island Not Seen as Solution to Travelers' Woes in Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 While foreign businessmen complain of obstacles to Japanese markets, travelers complain that crowded airports are the most frustrating barriers to getting into the country. In hopes of easing the bottleneck for air travelers, the Japanese are building an island in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and plan to put an airport on it. But few industry insiders think it will be the answer. The project is moving smoothly along, nevertheless, in contrast to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport, where riot police recently battled radicals who used firebombs to defend land on which a runway was to have been completed 15 years ago. At <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, eight farmers still grow vegetables on and around the planned second runway, refusing to sell their land. Though police have begun to dismantle buildings erected by radicals supporting the farmers, industry sources are doubtful the second runway will be completed by the end its new deadline, two years from now. For more than 20 years, protests against <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> have left six people dead. The airport is surrounded by barbed wire and riot police. It is not connected to key rail lines to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, 40 miles away. The $ 7 billion <LOCATION> Kansai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, however, will be out in the bay and not likely to generate any fights with the city's residents The airport is one of the world's biggest civil engineering projects of the 1990s, but it has its critics. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is famous for its bullet trains and sparkling subways, but its links to the outside world _ international airports _ are widely considered unworthy of a great economic power. The main link, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport, `` is becoming a symbol of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s closed nature,'' says <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakakibara </PERSON>, an economics professor. New <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> is officially called, greets passengers after long trans-Pacific flights with crowds and confusion. After picking up their luggage, passengers get a choice between a $ 200, 40-mile taxi ride to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> or a wait of an hour or more for a bus. <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> handled 4 million more passengers last year than it was planned for, all squeezing through the same number of immigration counters as when the airport opened in 1978. With just one runway, <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> handles 17 million passengers a year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> airport, with five runways, handles 10 million. `` The congestion is terrible,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurek </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> operations for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The day -LRB- <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> -RRB- opened it had already reached its comfortable capacity.'' The new Kansai airport, an hour's flight west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, is supposed to relieve the problem when it opens in 1993. But industry sources say the runway is too short, the distance to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> too far, and its link highways too narrow. An airport serving a metropolitan region that produces 2 percent of the world's economic output needs at least three runways, they say, not just one. Three were originally planned, and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> is still hoping for them, but the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> says the country can afford only one. Industry sources predict Kansai airport will be full within a year or two of its opening. They expect growth in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s international passengers in the next few years to nearly match the more than 20 percent annual growth since 1987 Today, boats cruise in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> where 747s will take off. Machines disgorge enough sand to fill scores of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Astrodomes </LOCATION> into a box 2.7 miles long that will be the airport's supposedly earthquake-proof base. It is one of the deepest of man-made islands, standing in 60 feet of water. On it will rise an ultra-modern terminal with people movers and indoor landscaping. A two-level bridge will carry trains and cars across 2.3 miles of water to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>'s shore. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> squeezes 122 million people _ half the population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ into a habitable area about the size of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; few of them want an airport in their backyard. That keeps airports small and inconvenient to city centers. The island airport will be an hour's bus ride from downtown <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>. The sand used for the island is costing more than it should because of price-fixing among contractors, who were stiffly fined by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s antitrust agency. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has charged that collusive business practices like the sand cartel keep out foreign businesses; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has made access to the airport's construction by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies a major trade issue with the Japanese After long negotiations, the airport opened bidding on construction and supplies to foreign firms, and an Italian architect won a design contest for the terminal building. Despite the prospect of problems ahead, foreign airlines are lining up for flight slots at the new airport. For many airlines, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are the fastest growing and most profitable markets in the world.

<HEAD>UNDATED: super cruisers.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 One of the groups, composed of the cruiser <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> with 8-inch guns and the cruisers <ORGANIZATION> Ajax </ORGANIZATION> and Achilles with 6-inchers, found the <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, where the River Plate vents to the sea. Each of the hunter groups was configured to deal with a pocket battleship, but this group lacked another 8-inch cruiser, the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, which was refitting in the Falklands. The <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> had 11-inch guns with greater range and hitting power than the British ships. Even with the <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> steaming toward her, the <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> had three minutes of unimpeded barrages before she came into <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>'s range. The lighter cruisers were under even a greater disadvantage. The Spee sought to stay at maximum range under the cover of smoke, but it soon found itself beset from three directions. The Exeter was hit and out of control when the light cruisers finally came into play. The <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> made for the River Plate under cover of smoke. The Exeter, her bridge and forward guns gone, was being steered from the emergency controls aft. The <ORGANIZATION> Ajax </ORGANIZATION> had lost its after turrets. The entire engagement had taken an hour and 20 minutes. The British ships pursued the Spee to <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> and lay to outside. They were joined by the Cumberland two days after the initial action, evening the odds. Capt. <PERSON> Langsdorff </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> notified the German admiralty of his plight and asked instructions. On the evening of Dec. 17, he headed his ship out of the harbor and toward the waiting British ships. Some two hours later she blew herself up. Two days later <PERSON> Langsdorff </PERSON> shot himself. <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> wrote: `` The effects of the action off the Plate gave intense joy to the British nation and enhanced our prestige throughout the world. The spectacle of the three smaller British ships unhesitatingly attacking and putting to flight their far more heavily gunned and armored antagonist was everywhere admired.'' Not everywhere. The Soviet naval publication, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, called it a demonstration of the impotence of the British. Meanwhile, the Soviets invaded <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> 25 days before Christmas, but the Finns would not lie down and play dead. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> moviegoers that Christmas would see white-clad Finnish ski troops on their newsreels. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> pleaded for a softening of the blackout regulations, which he saw as hurting the war effort and morale of the populace. Military objectives, he said, could best be attacked by daylight or moonlight. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> could be found easily by simple directional navigation. He suggested modified lighting that was employed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that allowed enough light to see 600 yards ahead and a margin of safety for motorists. `` There is no need to have the ` rosy glow' as a guide, and it would not be a guide if it were extinguished before the raiders leave the sea. But there is not much in it anyway ... `` The penalty we pay for the present methods is very heavy. First, the loss of life. Secondly, as the secretary of state for air has protested, the impediment to munitions output; and also work at the ports ... Thirdly, the irritating and depressing effect on the people, which is a drag upon their war-making capacity ... Fourthly, the anxieties of women and young girls in the darkened streets at night or on blacked-out trains. Fifthly, the effect on shopping and entertainments.'' He cited newspaper reports of a man who was prosecuted for smoking a cigarette too brightly, and another of a mother who was fined for turning on a light to care for her crying baby. Modifying to a dimout, he said, might help <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> make it through the mist and fog of the three winter months with better morale and greater safety. `` We can always revert to the existing practice if the war flares up, or if we do anything to provoke reprisals.'' The war would flare up. Before another war-free Christmas Day would dawn, some 50 million people would violently vanish from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.

 This time of year you'll find me everywhere. Even on my home turf, the North Country, I've become a profit with honor. Like today in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s old city I'm the chef's special on the dinner menu at the posh Victory Hotel: <PERSON> Renstek </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>. Across town, the food hall in the Ahlens department store is offering samples of renklamma, a delicious smoked sausage on barley bread coated with horseradish butter. In chic boutiques all over <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, you'll find me in a wide selection of sleeping bags, gloves, parkas, moccasins, snow boots with curled toes, primitive masks and, of course, on an endless array of Christmas cards and tree ornaments. <ORGANIZATION> Finnair </ORGANIZATION> has holiday flights to <PERSON> Tormanen </PERSON>, up near the border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, so good little boys and girls can visit <PERSON> Korvatunri </PERSON>, `` the cave of the ears,'' where Father Christmas overhears petitions for presents under the tree. Now the Swedes are selling condominiums to the cross-country ski set in my frozen stomping ground above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. Would you believe one of my mates got hit in the rump with an orange golf ball the other day while shoveling away the snow with his antlers to munch on some succulent lichens? In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> these antlers are pounded into a powder and sold as an aphrodisiac, a love potion. Well, why not? At this festive time of the year, I'm just about the most lovable critter anywhere. In case you have n't guessed, I'm a reindeer, nature's noblest, and perhaps most useful beast. There are a million like me. Maybe more, counting herds exported to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A few Christmases ago the headline writers were composing our epitaph. That nuclear reactor explosion at Chernobyl spread cesium-137 all over our grazing territory, which stretches from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Experts grimly predicted that our winter food supply of lichens, which have no roots and take all their nutrients from the air, would be radioactive for 20 to 30 years. To keep our herders from going bust, the governments of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> bought up all contaminated reindeer meat at 1985 prices, dyed it a bright blue, sold some to the mink farms and buried the rest. Can you imagine me, beloved of kids around the world, winding up in a nuclear waste dump? Not to worry. Here it is another Christmas, and reindeer meat, inspected and approved, is back in the gourmet shops. And we're still going strong on the hoof, as we have been since the Stone Age when they painted our picture in shocking pink on the wall of that cave in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> In 40 centuries we have n't changed much: still 3 -LCB- feet high, about the size of a Shetland pony, and weighing in at about 300 pounds. Our distinguishing features are wide, deeply cleft hoofs for skimming across marshes and snow fields; close haired, air-filled fur to keep out the cold; a hairy muzzle that serves as a ski mask, and these velvety antlers, sweeping upward, backward and forward again into broad tips of moose-like proportions. No other branch of the deer family equips both males and females with this elegant headgear. None lives so far north where the snows are deepest and food so scarce. To brag a bit, I can run faster than a horse, outdistance a pack of wolves, float like a cork, swim the swiftest rivers, trot 15 mph with 90 pounds on my back while pulling a sled loaded with 300 pounds and cover 40 to 50 miles a day in a blizzard. Over the years, the poets, painters and songwriters have been generous with their praise, if not always accurate. Like when <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> wrote in his classic, `` A Visit From St. Nicholas'': `` When what to my wondering eyes should appear, `` But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.'' Actually only seven reindeer are hitched to an akjar, the sled loaded with grandma and the baby, or maybe piled high with tents, blankets and cooking pots for the spring and autumn migrations that cover hundreds of miles. `` More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,'' continued the poet. A bit of poetic license there. Eagles are a menace. They can snatch up a newborn calf quicker than a hungry bear emerging from his winter hibernation. But wolverines are the real enemy. These cunning cousins of the weasel sneak up behind a reindeer burrowing under the snow and pounce on his rump. Worst of all are the mosquitoes, midges and gadflies that sting us on the muzzle, causing colds and congestion, and plant their eggs in the soft flesh under our eyelids, weakening our already poor vision. No wonder we head for the cool mountains in summer. The Christmas card artists got it right, however, about our herders being short, stocky, cheerful folk who wear curly toed boots filled with grass, tall pointy hats with funny flaps, and bright blue, not red, parkas elaborately trimmed with fur, embroidery, ribbons and sometimes silver.

 Like the sled driver in that poem, they do have `` cheeks like roses'' and `` a nose like a cherry.'' You'd glow like that, too, if you dashed out of a night 50 below into a sauna 220 above zero. Lapps or Laplanders, these rugged people are still widely called in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> their official name is <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>. They have their own language, of remote Hungarian and Finnish origin, with 120 words for snow and 400 for reindeer. Why not? We reindeer are their whole life, culture and history. Carbon tests on petrified slats found in tundra bogs show they have been chasing us on cross-country skis since at least 2500 B.C. We are their horse, sheep, cow and general store, available in one portable compact model. Tents, blankets, boots, parkas, leggings, sleeping bags are taken out of our hide. The meat, strong and flavorful, can be jerked, smoked, boiled or barbecued. Reindeer blood pancakes are an acquired taste. Our milk is four times richer than a cow's, great for butter and cheese. Bowls, spoons and fish hooks are fashioned from our antlers. Our sinews contribute harnesses, boot laces, lassos and thread spun on looms fashioned from our bones, which also provide knife handles, pack racks and the baby's kemse or cradle, all held together with glue from our hoofs. There really are reindeer games like you hear about in that <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> song. With dice and markers made from our toe bones, the herder's family gathers in the glow of the tent stove for a board game called wolf tablo, a variant of chess in which the wolf gobbles up some reindeer pawns until he finally is cornered. Reindeer are n't driven like cattle in the American West. We call the tune. Instinct dictates where and when we'll mosey off to richer pastures. The herder and his family just follow along, listening for the jingle bells around our necks and the hollow clicking noise the herd makes on the move. Tendons stretching across our toe bones make a sound like of a bunch of schoolboys cracking their knuckles. Before <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> established border controls in 1912, reindeer used to roam from the top of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bothania </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> meet, all the way to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Herding has changed dramatically in recent years. Logging operations in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> bases in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s unquenchable appetite for hydroelectric power have shrunk our traditional grazing ground Many herders have forsaken the old nomadic ways. They use planes, helicopters and walkie-talkie radios to follow our migrations. In <LOCATION> Rovaniemi </LOCATION>, up on the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, a Finnish firm called <ORGANIZATION> Rova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektro </ORGANIZATION> is marketing `` reindeer radar'' to replace the bells around our necks. Some herd handlers these days ride the frozen range on snowmobiles. `` Tinplate geldings,'' the <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> call them. This brings up a delicate subject. A few weeks ago a militant feminist on a TV talk show called <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> a male chauvinist because only a token doe, Vixen, made his starting lineup on Christmas Eve. The awful truth is that all sled-pulling reindeer are `` harkar'' _ geldings. Castration is performed at the fall roundup, when the huge herds that summered in the mountains are sorted out by family ownership for breeding, slaughter or sled training. The other big reindeer roundup comes early in spring when the young calves still following their mothers are literally earmarked for owner identification. I'll never forget the last day of my childhood. A lasso was thrown over my antlers, and I was bulldogged to the ground like a calf at a rodeo. The next thing you know the herder's plump wife was sitting on my flanks and carving a decorative slice out of my ear with a hunting knife. This snippet, along with others, was hung from the tent pole with care in the time-honored method of reindeer bookkeeping. Swedish <LOCATION> Lapland </LOCATION> alone has more than 10,000 legally registered reindeer earmarks, all different. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> the Red-nosed Reindeer has become what <LOCATION> Tin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION> calls a Golden Oldie. Among us, he's strictly for laughs. What <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> really needed to lead the pack was a glowing taillight. On our frequent travels through frozen mist and fog, we follow the wagging white tail of the reindeer just ahead. Although St. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s Day, the last Sunday in November, is the big feast in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION>, Christmas is a fun time for reindeer. The air is clean and bracing, fragrant with the scent of the stunted pines. We come gaily galloping with steam rising from our muzzles when the herder clangs his ice axe into the frozen snow to dig us out some tasty holiday tidbits. The sun at noon is just an embarrassed blush on the horizon, but in the diamond-studded long winter night the Northern Lights blaze purple and red and gold, more dazzling than the Rockefeller Center tree. It makes a reindeer want to sing out like <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> _ or at least bark, which is what we do: ` Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.''

 British actress <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> recently scored a first when she had a steamy love affair on `` Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Sirtis plays <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Troi </PERSON>, the half-human, half-betazoid counselor, on the popular syndicated series. The back story is that <PERSON> Troi </PERSON> and Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frakes </PERSON>, are former lovers. `` We play a lot of stuff between us that ends up on the cutting room floor,'' <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> says. `` The producers do n't like the relationship too much, although the fans love it. The producers want us to be free to have dalliances with aliens.'' In a recent episode, <PERSON> Troi </PERSON> had a love scene, which was the first time on the show two people were shown in bed together. `` We got a lot of letters saying you should n't have sex on ` Star Trek,''' she says. `` We touch on everything else. It's as though there's no sex in the 24th century.'' Despite her striking beauty, jet-black hair and dark eyes, <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> says people seldom recognize her on the street. `` I'm only recognized if I want to be recognized, which is good and bad,'' she says. `` I look different because I wear a wig and big, black contact lenses with a little hole for me to see through. `` I get invited to functions because of the show, and when I turn up people do n't know who I am. That's embarrassing. Especially if you're trying to impress someone you're with.'' In person, <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> does look different. Her wig hair is pulled back severely on `` Star Trek.'' Away from the show, her long, dark hair is full and wavy. She's more animated, has a keen sense of humor and laughs more than the rather serious <PERSON> Troi </PERSON>. Her English accent emerges when she's not acting. <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> had been in this country less than five months when she auditioned for the new `` Star Trek.'' She originally auditioned for the role of Lt. <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON>, the security chief, which went to <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, she'd done `` Wicked Lady'' with <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> and appeared opposite <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> in `` Death Wish III.'' She got a part in `` Hunter'' two weeks after she arrived here and was also on the TV series `` The Adventures of <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>.'' `` I grew up in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. My parents arrived from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> three months before I was born,'' she says. `` I blame my bad temper on being conceived in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. My parents' attitudes were pretty Victorian, so they saw being an actress as having about the same respectability as being a lady of the night. I was very bright in school and my parents had lofty ideas of me becoming a lawyer. I think my father was quietly supportive before he passed away. I think with ` Star Trek' my mother has finally accepted it. `` I came here because my looks went against me in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They do a lot of ` kitchen sink' dramas about working class problems. I was working class, I had a terrible cockney accent, but I could n't get cast in those things They said I was too pretty, too glamorous. I was never the lead. I was always ` the other woman.''' <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> says she had just ended a long relationship and decided it was time to exercise her ambitions elsewhere. `` I'd fought too hard to become an actress, because of my parents' opposition and the environment I grew up in. I felt I owed it to myself to do as well as I could,'' she says. `` Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' now in its third season, is the most successful hour-long drama in syndication. A sequel to the 1960s 22nd century `` Star Trek,'' it is set in the 24th century and features an all-new cast and a much-improved Starship Enterprise. Like the original, it was also created by <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddenberry </PERSON>. In the beginning, <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Troi </PERSON> was a lieutenant commander in the Star Fleet. She is now a civilian counselor aboard the Enterprise who uses her unusual senses and <LOCATION> ESP </LOCATION> to further the crew's mission. In the beginning of the series, there were too many stories about superior beings taking over the Enterprise and challenging the crew to some sort of test. Now the show emphasizes the relationships between the crew members and their encounters with strange worlds and unusual beings. That's what made the original `` Star Trek'' a phenomenal hit. `` The relationships are more important than plot,'' <PERSON> Sirtis </PERSON> says. `` The audience wants to see the people interact. Gene does n't allow conflicts between the crew members, although I ca n't imagine any close relationship over a long period of time that does n't have some conflict. Conflict is what an actor sinks his teeth into. We sneak it in sometimes, and he'll put his foot down.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> think of `` Closer Than Ever,'' their off-Broadway hit now on view at the Cherry Lane Theater, as a collection of musical short stories. It's not a musical revue and not a book musical, but 25 musical numbers about contemporary people and the things they do and the things they feel. `` The characters are more three-dimensional than you usually find in a revue,'' says <PERSON> Shire </PERSON>, the curly haired, soft-spoken half of the songwriting team. `` And the stories are thematically related.'' `` You find yourself moved the way that you would be moved at a musical or a play,'' <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> adds. `` I do n't know anybody who ever was moved by a revue. It's not the hallmark of revues to get your emotions.'' The four performers _ <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Muenz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintersteller </PERSON> _ sing their hearts out. In one wistful song called `` My Life,'' a woman reflects on what has happened to her failed marriage and faltering career. In another, a man sings about himself, `` One of the Good Guys,'' who thinks about the possibility of an affair but keeps true to his marriage. In a third, `` If I Sing,'' a son pays homage to his father, thanking him for the success he has had in life. Much of the revue started about five years ago as an `` urban file'' in <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON>'s home computer. At the time, the lyricist began saving notes and jottings from conversations with friends _ most of them in their late 40s. `` They were primarily stories our friends had told us about their lives,'' <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> was saying the other day. He thought they might make interesting subject matter for songs. At the same time, <PERSON> Shire </PERSON>, who lives part of the year in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, bought new synthesizer equipment that he planned to use for film scoring, something he has done a lot of in movieland. `` When I got these new toys, I went into a real improvisational binge to try them out,'' the composer says. `` Because they were high-tech, I was playing around with urban sounds. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> had said, ` Think urban.' So I opened up a computer file in my sequencer and collected a lot of music.'' Out of their collaboration came the songs for `` Urban Blight,'' a small revue about the perils of living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The show, which also had sketches by such established playwrights as <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Durang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>, had a short run at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. But the performers were more actors than singers. Both <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> felt the songs' full potential had n't been tapped and wanted to use them again. Some ended up in `` Closer Than Ever.'' Other songs for `` Closer Than Ever'' were orphans from `` Baby,'' the duo's one Broadway musical that had a seven-month run during the 1983-84 season. `` Twelve songs wound up in ` Baby,''' <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> says, `` But we wrote approximately 50. Some of them deserved to be put away forever. Others were redundant, but there were three or four which we were quite proud of and the plot ultimately did n't have room for.'' Material from `` Baby'' and five songs from `` Urban Blight,'' plus what <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> calls `` odds and ends,'' were ultimately pulled together by <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON>'s assistant, a young director named <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, for an evening of entertainment called `` Next Time Now.'' It was performed last spring by three singers at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cabaret spot called Eighty-Eights. The response was good enough to encourage further work. That refinement occurred at the <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in July when <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> came aboard as co-director of the show. New songs were written and one more performer added. `` A lot of the songs are related to things in our life,'' <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> says. `` Our work since ` Baby' has tended to be more personal, the things we are feeling and what our friends are feeling. Our experiences with our wives, our fathers or with fatherhood, for example.'' `` And what could have been a grab bag of material turned into an evening of portraits, a collection of self-contained songs,'' <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> have been writing together for more than 30 years. They met as freshmen at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. Both had musical backgrounds _ their fathers were both bandleaders. Musical theater fans know their earlier revue `` Starting Here, Starting Now,'' which had a short run off-Broadway in 1977. The show, mostly songs from unproduced Maltby-Shire musicals, became a cult favorite, thanks to a recording by RCA <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> and numerous productions around the country. RCA has recorded `` Closer Than Ever'' in its entirety and will release it in January. The two men have also worked separately and with others. <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> was the director of the hit Fats <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> revue `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' and was co-lyricist for `` Miss Saigon,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s newest musical smash which is expected on Broadway in the He has also written the lyrics for `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nora </PERSON>,'' a musical version of `` The Thin Man,'' also due in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next season. Shire has written scores for more than 40 movies, including `` The Conversation,'' `` All the President's Men'' and `` Farewell, My Lovely.'' He also picked up an Oscar as composer of the song `` It Goes Like It Goes'' from `` <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>.'' And he's currently working on a stage adaptation of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>'s novel, `` God Knows,'' with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>. Still, they have always come back to work with each other. `` We've worked every way possible, but mainly sitting together in rooms for very long periods of time being each other's gadfly, cheering section and artistic conscience,'' <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> says. `` We throw away a lot of each other's material.'' <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> worked on `` Closer Than Ever'' right up to its opening in November, adding a new song shortly before previews started and carefully going over lyrics to existing ones. `` Truthfully, most of the songs never have a moment when they are done,'' <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> says. `` There just is a moment when you stop working on them. Then suddenly, you go into rehearsal and somewhere along the way you realize they are in the show.''

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, recalls his days growing up. He, his brothers and mother all worked in the general store of his father, a Moslem who arrived penniless from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> after the turn of the century. `` He was a street vendor'' in a hot, backwater province until he saved enough to buy the store, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said. After several setbacks, the business prospered and the father, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON>, insisted his four sons go to college. `` He instilled in us the need ... to study for a career,'' said <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who became a lawyer, provincial governor and, last July, was elected president on the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` He used to say the only safe thing in life was a university degree.'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 59, typifies the Arab experience not only in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> but across <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The descendants of tens of thousands of Arabs who fled poverty and oppression and settled in cities and towns across <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and throughout the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> have become figures of consequence in business, the armed forces and, increasingly, politics. Some have achieved fame, others notoriety. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, three of the 22 candidates for president in the first round of elections Nov. 15 were of Lebanese descent, including <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, the Lebanese-descended <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> family has produced two presidents of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and his son, Averroes; and one candidate for president, <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s nephew <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON>. Prominent Chileans of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> descent include Dr. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Neghme </PERSON>, former dean of the medical school at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chile </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauro </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and president of the bar association; and <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Esguep </PERSON>, both of whom have headed <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s Olympic Committee. The Argentine list includes the philosopher-diplomat <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Massuh </PERSON>, former secretary general of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, pianist <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrella </PERSON>, novelist <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Asis </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sapag </PERSON> families who have served as provincial governors and national senators, and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are the third biggest ethnic group in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' after the Spanish and Italians, said <PERSON> Ramez </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacra </PERSON>, past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do n't think that the glory of Arabs in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> started with <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Chacra </PERSON>, a clothing wholesaler, said good naturedly between phone calls, sips of black coffee and instructions to employees in his busy store. `` He just made us fashionable.'' Arabs began arriving in large numbers at the end of the last century. Waves followed the end of each of the world wars. `` ` Arab' immigration really means <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> _ the parts of the decaying Ottoman Empire that were subject to religious discrimination, military draft, persecution, massacre,'' said Zake Consul, cultural affairs officer at the Syrian Embassy in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Today, 15 million people of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> descent live in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and has branches in 22 countries. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has the most at 8 million, with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> next at 2 million, <PERSON> Chacra </PERSON> said. The first immigrants intended to make money and return home, Consul said. When that proved impossible, they settled in. By most accounts, they were warmly received. `` Arabs coming to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> found the generosity of the Chilean people, their warm reception,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadad </PERSON>, a lawyer and leading member of the Arab community in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` Our grandparents, our parents always tell us that.'' <PERSON> Monsour </PERSON> <PERSON> Challita </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Gibran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and former ambassador of the League of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said, `` The Lebanese found for the first time a country they could count on to protect them, and a friendly hospitable people.'' Many immigrants were Orthodox Christians, not Moslems; they mostly spoke French, not Arabic. They assimilated easily, learning Portuguese in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and Spanish in the other countries. Many descendants, including <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, were baptized as Roman Catholics, the dominant religion in the region, and assimilated so completely they do not speak or write the language of their parents. Some changed their names to lessen what discrimination there was, or simply to fit in better. <PERSON> Alferez </PERSON>, which means `` the horseman'' in Arabic, became <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON> became <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> -LRB- both mean `` smith'' in their languages -RRB-, <PERSON> Zaituni </PERSON> became <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> -LRB- both mean `` olive'' or `` olive tree'' -RRB-. Initially, the new arrivals were called `` Turks'' because they carried Turkish passports. That sobriquet is inaccurate and is considered pejorative. In <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Amado </PERSON>'s novel `` Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon,'' set in the Brazilian city of <LOCATION> Ilheus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gabriela </PERSON> is married to cafe owner <PERSON> Nacib </PERSON>, a Syrian who protests violently when townspeople call him `` Turk.'' As brothers and cousins joined family members who arrived earlier, the Arabs quickly spread out. Social and cultural clubs are common, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighborhoods _ such as <PERSON> Rua </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfandega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, a street lined with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> shops and restaurants _ are rare, as are examples of Arab architecture, like mosques. `` The Arab community never has been a ghetto,'' noted <PERSON> Hadad </PERSON>, the Chilean attorney. `` It has always been an active, integrated part of Chilean society. ... We are Chileans. We feel Chilean.'' Arabs have played controversial or highly publicized roles in their adopted societies. Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> led a nationistic sector of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s army that rebelled against former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> in December 1988. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> recently was ordered into retirement. Police in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are looking for <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, a billionaire investor who vanished in August after being indicted in connection with a stock market scandal. <PERSON> Nahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaias </PERSON>, a banking and press magnate and one of the richest men in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, was kidnapped and held for ransom in 1985 by the <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vive </PERSON> and was killed in a shootout between that subversive group and police.

<TEXT>
 The Colombian government's war on drugs has brought hard times to <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>, typical of the towns in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> where people earn a living by growing the coca leaves that are processed into cocaine. And hard times could mean social unrest in an area where anti-government guerrillas operate. When the government declared its war Aug. 19, the demand for coca leaf dried up around <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> as traffickers disappeared to avoid arrest. The price of coca base, which is made into cocaine, fell from $ 660 to $ 330 a kilogram _ 2.2 pounds. Prices have fluctuated since then and recently were about $ 475 a kilogram. Many of <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>' residents, who were barely making a living by growing coca even when prices were high, now say they have been pushed to the economic brink. `` We ask ourselves what we're going to do,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, a coca grower. `` I mean, are we going to have to declare war in order to get enough food to feed our families?'' Authorities estimate 80 percent of <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>' 17,000 people depend on coca cultivation for their livelihood. The town, 267 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> near the headwaters of the <LOCATION> Vaupes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, can be reached only by air; no roads go out from it to areas where farmers could sell other crops, such as corn or rice. Peasants who work on the small farms owned by big coca producers earn the equivalent of $ 95 a month, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s minimum wage. A farmer working his own one or two acres might average $ 7 for a 10-hour day. Most growers in <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> work for others and grow their own coca crops as well. Authorities estimate 550 to 1,100 pounds of coca leaves are needed to produce one kilogram of coca base. The amount of leaf required varies with its quality and with the efficiency of the processing. The anti-narcotics police chief in <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>, Lt. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>' population has decreased 30 percent in the past three months. He and other officials attributed the exodus to the government's war on traffickers. `` These days, traffickers are all on the run,'' said <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverry </PERSON>, the head of the government's agricultural development corporation in the region. `` Since there is no one to buy coca, the price has fallen.'' Any drop in the Colombian coca supply probably will not affect cocaine availability in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, since most coca is grown in neighboring <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's war on drugs is almost certain to add instability in <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> and other coca-growing regions in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a former grower, has managed to stay in <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> although he abandoned his 25-acre coca field near the town when prices of coca first began to fall in 1983 because of overproduction. He got a job as a loader with one of the cargo airlines serving <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said most people who quit cultivating coca had not been so lucky. The choice is often between going hungry and getting out. `` They leave, but they do n't have anywhere to go,'' he said. `` There are no jobs for them anywhere else in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and many of them turn to crime. The problems with coca are generating social problems.'' Farmers added that the influence of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>, the country's oldest and largest anti-government guerrilla group, is likely to grow in the area along with the economic misery. Coca grower <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said people now are listening to the guerrillas' argument that armed revolution is the only way to better their lives. `` If the government really wants to get rid of the guerrillas, it should do something to help us,'' he said. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> produces only about one tenth of the coca grown in the Andean region, but the <LOCATION> Guaviare </LOCATION> region encompassing <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> accounts for 80 percent of Colombian coca. Since no roads run to <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION>, nine daily cargo flights, old propeller driven planes, are the town's only link to the rest of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The planes bring food, liquor, cosmetics _ almost everything the residents need _ including the gasoline they pour on coca leaves to extract juices. Another problem for growers is that the planes are bringing far less gasoline than they did three months ago. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, whose police platoon controls the airstrip, said he had cut gasoline shipments to 10,000 gallons from 40,000 gallons in an effort to slow coca base processing. The move has angered farmers. `` This is a military dictatorship down here,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, surrounded by other growers as he talked to a reporter in a wooden shack that has been converted into a bar. Almost all of the men who said they grew coca expressed a desire to get out of the business, which they say no longer is profitable, but not much is in store for them. In boom years, growers made thousands of dollars a month but beginning in 1983 found themselves trying to eke out a living. Farmers could not pay their debts, and lenders working for drug traffickers began settling scores with bullets. That brought in the police and army reinforcements and <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> suffered a wave of violence that left scores of dead every week. Even with the drop in prices, communities like <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> that can be reached only by plane, coca is likely to be the principal crop for years to come. Farmers in <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> say they try to keep growing coca because, as poorly as the crop pays, the alternatives are even worse. Under its National Rehabilitation Plan, the government set up a program to buy corn and other crops from farmers in backward areas and has subsidized them by paying the high cost of air transport to markets hundreds of miles away. But the high production cost of corn and other alternative crops in isolated areas limits farmers' interest in the program. Some growers in <LOCATION> Miraflores </LOCATION> said they will try to get by until the price of coca goes back up.

 A socialist and a pro-business advocate are squaring off in a presidential runoff election seen as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s last chance to peacefully resolve deep-seated social and economic problems. Some 82 million voters are eligible to choose on Sunday between conservative <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> and radical leftist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> in the second round of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first free presidential election since 1960. The two led a 21-candidate field in the first round Nov. 15, but neither obtained the majority required by law. The winner will succeed President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> for a five-year term starting March 15. Both Collor de Mello and <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> are young, charismatic leaders with broad support among <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s poor majority. Both started their political rise during the 1964-1985 right-wing military regime. Both are harsh critics of the <LOCATION> Sarney </LOCATION> government, which they accuse of being inept and corrupt. But the two differ sharply on the solutions for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s economic and social problems, which include 1,460 percent inflation, widespread poverty and a $ 110 billion foreign debt, the largest in the Third World Many see the election as a last chance for a peaceful resolution of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s glaring social and economic inequalities. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says, for example, that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s income distribution is the most unequal anywhere. `` If the new government does n't solve <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s problems, it will face a crisis and collapse in economic and social chaos: food shortages, looting of supermarkets, paralyzation of public services, the middle class attacked by starving masses,'' said political scientist <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaguaribe </PERSON>. `` Everything indicates democracy will not survive,'' The favorite is <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, 40, who founded his center-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> just 10 months ago. The scion of a wealthy political clan in the tiny sugar cane-growing state of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION> in the impoverished <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> won tremendous popularity with promises to clean up corrupt government. His well-cut suits, aquiline good looks and stinging attacks on <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> captured the imagination of poor voters. He also is backed by right-wing parties, businessmen, big landowners and the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest. His critics say <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s record belies his posture as a moralizer. They point out he was a member of the old military regime's political party and was accused of payroll padding and favoring the sugar barons while governor of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION>. `` Collor de Mello has an image as an anti-politician, a man against the system,'' <PERSON> Jaguaribe </PERSON> said. `` He hides his center-right tendency behind a moralist pose.'' The 44-year-old <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, popularly known as <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>, a nickname he had legalized, is a congressman and former lathe operator who is the candidate of the radical left <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A grade-school dropout, the stocky, bearded <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> became nationally known in 1980 when he led a strike against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s foreign-owned auto industry He later was sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison for breaking the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> but wound up serving just 30 days, as the ruling generals announced a plan for a gradual return of civilian liberties. In 1986, both <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> and <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> moved toward national recognition in politics. Collor de Mello switched to the opposition Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was elected governor of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION> and made national headlines by firing so-called `` maharajas,'' local civil servants making thousands of dollars a months mostly through political connections. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 with more votes than any other candidate. He is supported by leftist labor groups, intellectuals and the dominant liberal wing of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The winner will take on the task of leading a country of 150 million people with the Western world's eighth-largest economy, but in which the richest 1 percent owns as much as the poorest 50 percent, and half the work force earns the equivalent of $ 20 a week or less. Both candidates say fighting inflation is the No. 1 priority and promise to court foreign investment. But they diverge sharply on other issues. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> proposes to cut spending and `` privatize'' many state-run companies. He favors a conventional approach to the $ 110 billion foreign debt but would limit repayments to 2 percent of the gross national product, or about $ 5 billion a year, about a third of what <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> now pays. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> promises higher wages, curbs on profits and an immediate moratorium on foreign debt payments. He is against the sale of state companies and spending cuts. `` To raise salaries, someone has to lose,'' the gravelly voiced candidate said in a recent televised debate. `` It's impossible to fight inflation without suspending payment of the foreign debt.'' The gap between the candidates has polarized the election into a battle of left vs. right, rich vs. poor, socialism vs. free market. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is in a state of war, and in war you have to take sides. I want to take the side of the poor, whom <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> represents,'' Bishop <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Morelli </PERSON> of Duque de Caxias, an impoverished city near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, said in an interview. Collor de Mello has played on the elite's fear of a da <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> government. He warned of a `` blood bath'' if the leftist wins. `` <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>'s radical ideas mean strikes and chaos,'' says one campaign advertisement for Collor de Mello. `` Foreign investment will leave <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> is a step backward for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, president of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of the State of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> predicted that `` 800,000 businessmen will flee the country'' if <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> is elected. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s campaign ads counter that <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> is a `` creation of the dictatorship'' and advise viewers, `` Do n't put a fox in charge of the henhouse.'' `` <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> is virtually the only national leader who can say, ` I am from the people. I look like the people.' He has real credibility,'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, professor of political science and dean of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said in an interview in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, where he attended a recent seminar. While the campaign has stirred passions among voters _ 73 percent of whom never cast a ballot for president _ the campaign has been remarkably peaceful. `` For a country to come out of 21 years of military rule with the worst income distribution in the world and have the majority of the people committed to democratic change is extraordinary,'' <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> said. The last elected president was <PERSON> Janio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadros </PERSON> in 1960. He abruptly resigned after seven months in office claiming an `` oligarchy'' sought to disrupt his presidency. The ensuing confusion led to an armed forces coup in 1964. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a civilian, was chosen in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by the military government.

<HEAD>A Video Christmas, Or, How To Spend $1,500 Without Half Trying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stuck on what to buy this Christmas? Make it video! Whether you want to splurge, spree, invest or just stuff a few stockings, here are some wonderful items to buy and some excellent excuses for buying them. SPLURGE: A new television set with a 27-inch screen. If you're a typical American, you've been watching that 19-inch tube for more than a few years while new technology has been making it obsolete. This is no time to wait for High Definition TV. The best estimates put <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> at least five years away from the expensive end of the marketplace and maybe even longer before it's affordable in the mass consumer market. Japanese manufacturers are designing video and audio circuitry that tweaks the TV signal for all it's worth. They make `` enhanced definition'' with much sharper pictures, even if you live in an area where cable TV is n't available everywhere. Much of the broadcast soundtrack in major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities is in hi-fi stereo, so a tinny little speaker just is n't going to make it for the 1990s. An `` inexpensive'' 19-inch set costs about $ 200 in a discount house. It's about $ 400 for a 19-inch TV loaded with the new technology, and about $ 700 for a low-end, high-tech 27-inch tube. In areas where such electronic goods are heavily discounted, you can shop around and get a stunning, stereophonic `` cable-ready'' TV set for less than $ 1,000. We're talking automatic tuning, inputs for multiple video sources, outputs to your home stereo, a `` smart'' remote control and a picture that'll knock your eyes out. Go for it.

 SPREE: A combination LaserDisc and compact disc player. If you have n't already taken the plunge into digital audio for your home stereo, you should. Compact discs do n't wear out and make any stereo system sound startlingly better. The budget-minded approach is to buy a small portable unit to start, then trade up to a full-featured model. But if you've got some Christmas money to throw around, why not get into digital audio with a machine that also plays videos? They cost around $ 500 in the discount houses, but the LaserDisc image is said to be 60 percent sharper than the best VHS player and the sound quality is just like a CD. Newly released LaserDiscs are sometimes cheaper than VHS tapes. A VHS new release that retails for $ 89.95 is in the video disc rack for $ 49.95, and some may sell for $ 29.95. And in theory LaserDiscs do n't wear out and the digital signal will never become obsolete. Also, there are certain features you ca n't get with a VCR, such as `` letterbox'' formatting that allows you to see the wide screen image. In the `` full-feature'' LaserDisc format, the producers include incredibly comprehensive supplementary material. The three-disc package for the 1936 classic musical `` Showboat'' includes excerpts from the 1929 Universal film version, excerpts of <PERSON> Ziegfield </PERSON>'s 1932 Broadway revival, interviews with stars, a color film documentary on showboats, a visual essay of 300 stills tracing the history of showboats and the history of the musical on stage, screen and radio, and enough other archival material to choke a librarian.

 INVEST: _ A VHS player Not a recorder, mind you, but a transportable, play-only machine that can run off a 12-volt car, boat or RV system and is about half the size and half the cost of a videocassette recorder. It's great to have a backup when your main VCR breaks down. It's great to have a portable VCR when you're on vacation or out of the country You have to look for these, but they're available at most video dealers and start at around $ 150. _ A four-head, hi-fi, Super VHS videocassette recorder Or, at the very least, a stereo VCR that you can pipe through your home audio system.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 STOCKING STUFFERS: _ A non-abrasive VCR head cleaner Use it only when you have significant deterioration in picture quality. Tape heads are delicate, precision devices and should not be messed with. _ Blank tapes People never have enough blank tapes and they never buy themselves high quality tapes. _ Videocassette storage racks People never have enough places to store videocassettes, which need and deserve a safe, dust-free resting place. _ A year's worth of cable TV service Surprisingly affordable. Gift certificates are available. Call your local cable company for details. _ Videocassettes Most people are surprisingly reluctant to buy themselves their favorite movies, and you usually know what your friends and relatives enjoy, from `` Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles'' to rock concert videos, operas and great games of the World Series. Even better, the emergence of big retail video chains and the plethora of available programming has pushed down the price of video software. Suprisingly, the monster hits of recent years are most heavily discounted. `` Batman,'' the summer megahit, is couponed, rebated and generally knocked down to less than $ 20. `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' lists for about $ 20; `` E.T. The Extraterrestrial'' is about $ 25. `` The Right Stuff'' lists for around $ 30, and the newly restored version of `` Lawrence of Arabia'' is $ 40. There's also an abundance of competitively priced, Christmas-oriented programming in video stores at this time of the year, from old favorites such as <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s `` Holiday Inn'' to cartoons that will hose down the kids late on Christmas Day. _ LaserDiscs Any great film makes for a great disc, and most are digitally remastered to take advantage of the technology. `` Blade Runner'' is a big favorite; so are `` Gone With the Wind'' -LRB- cropped back down to its original format and its colors restored -RRB- and `` The Godfather.'' But the hit pick for Christmas giving has to be `` Lawrence of Arabia.'' The 1962 Academy Award-winning film was restored from its original negatives under the supervision of director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>, who added 20 minutes of footage cut from the original release. The standard CLV -LRB- $ 49.95 -RRB- and the extended play -LRB- 3 discs, $ 124.95 list -RRB- contain copious supplementary material.

<TEXT>
 SOME VIDEO DO N'Ts: _ Do n't buy for video collectors without very specific knowledge or Either they'll already have it, they'll quibble at the quality of the recording or the format, or they'll say they only wanted `` ` Ishtar,' any format, man.'' Buy them a can of compressed air for blowing dust out of their machines or a spray bottle of glass cleaner and no-lint paper towels. Buy them a videocassette rewinder -LRB- battery-powered, $ 29.95 at Radio Shack -RRB- or a bulk eraser to get rid of unwanted recordings. _ Do n't forget to buy `` Instant Fireplace,'' at $ 9.95 _ the logical culmination of a television culture Put the cassette in the VCR. Punch `` play.'' Watch the video of fire burning in fireplace. Listen to the appropriate music. Wonder about the decline of the West.

 `` Let Love Rule'' -LRB- Virgin -RRB- _ <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> Quick now _ the cover of <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON>'s `` Let Love Rule'' album pictures a black man in dreadlocks with a ring through his nose. What type of music does the cover protect? Your first guess was probably not a singer-songwriter album that owes much to the 1970s work of such artists as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>. But confounding expectations is <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON>'s game. His debut album is encouraging in several respects. First, it's nice to see an artist _ any artist _ break past stereotypes at a time when racial tension is high and too many people have closed-minded views about what's `` black music'' or `` white music.'' Second, it's encouraging that any company in the conservative record business will allow a brand new artist to produce, write and perform an album virtually by himself. Many established artists do n't get the same trust. Of course, the clear danger in these `` homemade'' projects is too much self-indulgence. Yes, `` Let Love Rule'' suffers from this. But what it lacks in slickness it frequently makes up for in charm and intimacy. With its overly polite, workmanlike drumming, `` Let Love Rule'' sounds much like <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s first solo album. <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> also shows a fondness for the hippie era in his lyrics for such songs as `` I Build This Garden for Us.'' The soaring title track is one of this rookie's best moments, as is `` Mr. Cab Driver.'' In the latter, <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> accompanies himself on fuzztone guitar while telling of a cab driver passing him up for a ride because of his dreads and skin color. He ends with an expletive. `` My Precious Love,'' a gospel number with guest organist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, is another high point. `` Be'' sounds strikingly like Plastic Ono Band-era <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. Be forewarned, though: `` Let Love Rule'' begins to get ponderous toward the end, with many arrangements crawling. <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> may not be the genius that this self-produced effort seems to herald. But simply dismissing him as Mr. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonet </PERSON> -LRB- his TV-star wife -RRB- is a mistake. He's got enough talent and strength of convictions to merit watching. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Variations on a Theme by <PERSON> Hindemith </PERSON>, Symphony No. 2, by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> -LRB- EMI -RRB- _ the <ORGANIZATION> Bournemouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, conducted by <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> Here is a regional European orchestra that performs difficult music at the highest level. <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> elicits crackling yet controlled performances. The <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION> musicians play with the clarity and solidity typical of many British orchestras; the winds, particularly in the symphony's Andante movement, play real chamber music. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s idiom, though at times reminiscent of <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>, is highly original and produces an abundance of orchestral sounds. His music is worth getting to know. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Roger Moore Goes for the `Bullseye'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For actor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> is a closed chapter, except for occasional snatches of <LOCATION> Bondian </LOCATION> repartee. `` The only time you do n't want a tape recorder is under the bed,'' he jokes to an interviewer on the set of `` Bullseye,'' his latest movie. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who took over from <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> as Agent 007, is 62 now and taking it easy. He tried a musical and quit during rehearsals. `` Bullseye,'' he says, is `` an extension of our home life,'' because it pairs him with an old friend, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>. His daughter also has a part. He has an easy, unpretentious manner, and looks fit enough to do another Bond movie or two. But `` A View to a Kill,'' in 1985, was his seventh and last and there are no plans for him to play the role again. Before that he did eight years as `` The Saint'' on television. In `` Bullseye,'' he and <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> play double roles as a pair of unsuccessful con men and as crooked atom scientists selling state secrets. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, a 1987 Academy Award nominee for `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>,'' plays the girl they once shared. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s 26-year-old daughter, plays an undercover <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent The $ 15 million comedy caper, directed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON> -LRB- `` Death Wish,'' `` A Chorus of Disapproval'' -RRB-, comes from <PERSON> Menahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>'s 21st Century productions, and is due for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release late next summer. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricusse </PERSON>'s script allows <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> to show off a David Niven-esque comic touch that was often lacking in the Bond movies. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> traces his friendship with the 56-year-old <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> to the 1960s, when he bumped into him on a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> street. `` I'd seen him on TV, stopped him and told him I thought he had a future,'' recalled <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, adding teasingly: `` It shows how wrong I was.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shakira </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> have often stayed with each other in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Their first children were born six weeks apart, so the two wives `` shared'' their pregnancies, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Both actors are of humble <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> origins: <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> an East End cockney, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> a policeman's son. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> says their approach to work is different. Unlike the ever-busy <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> insists: `` I'm very happy not working. ... I do n't need work to keep me happy.'' `` If you really want to act you have to want to do it more than anything. You have to be willing to put up with crap at all levels, including the food you eat and sometimes the food you do n't eat,'' he said. He surprised the entertainment world by taking a singing role in <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s new musical, `` Aspects of Love.'' But he bowed out in March, six weeks into rehearsal, saying he could n't sing the part `` It's all right, I suppose, if you're 20: You jump in, and you do it. Otherwise, you're up there to be sniped at; it's very much a no-win situation.'' He has one film awaiting release, `` Bed and Breakfast'' with <PERSON> Talia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON>, and another comedy set to roll early next year. He thinks acting is a tougher profession than when he started out more than 30 years ago. `` There were more provincial theaters, more repertory theaters, more of a chance to learn acting,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who spent three terms at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dramatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> before leaving to get practical experience in provincial repertory. `` Now, you're thrown into the deep end; you do n't have time to learn. No one has time to teach you anything.'' He says he is neutral about his daughter's decision to go into acting. `` I did n't encourage her, I did n't discourage her,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who has two other children, both sons. `` There's a lot of heartache attached to it, a lot of hard work.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> and Dramatic Art. She changed her stage surname to <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON> because there's another <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in British Equity, the actors' union. Her father does n't think his fame has advanced her career: `` I think I've been a hindrance to her. `` There are an awful lot of socialists out there who hate success, who hate anything associated with success, so they think I'm successful and they say, ` Oh, we'll get somebody else.' `` You will note,'' he added wryly, `` that I am slightly right wing of <PERSON> Attila </PERSON>.'' Nepotism, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> says, is not what it used to be. He says people think <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>'s related to <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>, the young star of `` E.T The Extraterrestrial,'' and adds with a laugh: `` It makes it worse.''

<HEAD>From `Death Wish' to a New Wish: Winner's Return to Comedy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-WKD--Bullseye, b0856</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thinking back on his career, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON> finds something very odd. And that is, he said, that `` a very sophisticated British chap who lives in a stately home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has made more films probably than most Americans in the worst slums of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Winner is a <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> University-educated sort of chap who puffs cigars and is best known for directing the `` Death Wish'' series of movies about vigilante warfare against the punks, rapists and muggers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Now he has gone back to trying to make people laugh. `` I sort of slipped into this bath of blood and made all those pictures, and I decided I had to do something myself to get back,'' Winner said during a break on the set of `` Bullseye,'' his comedy caper starring <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>. Due for summer release and budgeted at $ 15 million, `` Bullseye'' pairs <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> for the first time on-screen, playing dual roles as con men and atom scientists. On one recent day, Winner was shooting at the west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> location of <LOCATION> Syon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, home since 1594 to the Dukes of <LOCATION> Northumberland </LOCATION> and substantially redesigned two centuries later by architect <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and master landscape-gardener Capability <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. It's a long way from Winner's urban nightmares starring <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, and the director acknowledged he was more in his element here. `` I'm more at home as we talk here in a wonderful 18th century palazzo, which is the sort of place I live in,'' said Winner, who lives in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> mansion in the <LOCATION> Bayswater </LOCATION> district with British actress <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagrove </PERSON>. `` It's quite nice to be back in a more sophisticated area.'' Winner makes no apologies for the violence that has often defined his films, from `` The Mechanic'' in 1972 to the three `` Death Wish'' movies. `` I think they were good thrillers,'' said Winner, whose films have been accused of irresponsibly encouraging viewers to take the law into their own hands. `` I have many friends who are muggers in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They are fascinating people, underused people, who have to make do when society rejects them. I love the people there,'' he said. Winner started out as a critic and journalist. His early movies were comedies, among them a caper film `` The Jokers,'' with <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. But his comedies on the whole have not done well, critically or financially. His 1975 `` Won Ton Ton the Dog Who Saved Hollywood'' flopped, despite a starry supporting cast including <PERSON> Henny </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blondell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>. He has just come out with `` A Chorus of Disapproval,'' his film of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s acclaimed play, to a lukewarm critical reception. The `` Bullseye'' casting coup was his idea, based, he says, on having watched <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> at dinner parties and seeing `` how wonderfully they work together as a comedy act socially. `` We've always said we must find something ... and it just happened merely by chance: I found this script that needed a lot of work but was basically a wonderful piece for them, so here we are.'' Winner said the stars' off-screen rapport was evident on screen. `` They will often carry on a scene with ad libs of their own,'' he said. `` There's a shorthand both during the shooting and during the lunch break and all the time.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Artist Sculpts With Explosives</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sculpture is risky business for French artist <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON>. Instead of chisels, she sculpts with dynamite, hand grenades and artillery shells. <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON>, 39, is the inventor of `` blast art,'' a term she created to describe the jagged hunks of twisted steel born from her carefully planned explosions. Her studio is located on her family's farm outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in the middle of corn and beet root fields stretching as far as the eye can see. Yet the explosions she sets off, using between 11 and 33 pounds of dynamite, rattle windows in villages miles away. The farm is dotted with sculpture of all shapes and sizes including a giant mushroom form made from an imploded gas canister, and graceful flower pots sprouting stainless steel tulips from inside. During a recent interview, <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON> demonstrated her art. She used penthrite, the same explosive that police say was used to bomb a passenger jet of the French airline <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> last October over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The penthrite itself is n't dangerous. Things get risky the moment you connect the explosive to the detonator,'' she said, holding up the two-inch device. `` If this goes off before I'm ready, I'll lose three fingers and an eye. The most treacherous aspect of her work, she explained, comes from elements she can not control _ such as the random electrical current generated by high-speed trains passing by just 164 feet from the woods where she does the blasting _ and which could, in fact, ignite the explosive before she is safely away. Preparations for the explosion took more than an hour. <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON> wrapped the plastic-coated penthrite cords in a spiral design around the insides of a cylindrical steel frame that supported a vacuum-sealed aluminum can. At one point, the rusted frame tipped over, with <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON> inside, and narrowly missed the water table in which the explosion was to take place. Once the can was secured inside the frame, it was lowered into the vat. <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON> then wound up an electrical sparker that set off the blast. `` Three, two, one,'' she yelled. Yanking the lever, the loud blast sent a shower of water high into the air, wetting onlookers. Steam rose from the churning water. The frame was hoisted high in the air, and there was <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON>'s sculpture _ a dripping, crumpled aluminum can filled with dirt balls. But she is only half-pleased. `` The hardest part of my work is trying to determine how the material is going to react, given the amount of explosive used and how it is attached,'' she said. `` This is n't bad, but I think I'll explode it again to open up the top part. The second explosion _ this time on the ground _ takes visitors watching from behind a shatter-proof glass window by surprise as the can is propelled into the air behind a cloud of pungent smoke. The carcass will become a finished work of art once it is washed and polished. <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON> has been working with explosives for seven years, ever since the day she found an abandoned, rusting gas canister `` a bunch of kids probably blew up for fun.'' `` Its hollow shape was what I'd been trying to achieve in marble and wood for a long time,'' she said. `` The moment I saw the can, I knew I'd found my calling.'' She has perfected her knowledge and use of explosives during frequent seminars at French military bases. In the beginning, she was the oddball artist. Today, she is known to everyone, and is taken seriously enough to receive grants from the Culture and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> ministries. Besides penthrite and dynamite, which she stores in special, temperature and humidity-controlled closets protected by sophisticated alarm systems, <PERSON> Cottet </PERSON> sculpts with hand grenades and artillery shells. She finds out when the military base in <LOCATION> Bourges </LOCATION> is planning to fire missiles and artillery shells, and places her material in the right position so it will be blown up in the way she wants. `` Look at this piece of armored steel,'' she said caressing the hundreds of jagged dents left by bullets. `` Is n't it beautiful?'' Not everyone agrees. The artist has run into considerable opposition, not only from art institutions such as the Beaux Art academy where she trained, but also from private galleries, collectors _ and even fellow artists. `` People told me I was crazy when I began working with explosives. They might look at the sculpture and say they like it, but when they find out it was done with explosives, they shy away,'' she said. But she dismissed the idea that her work is off-putting because it bears the traces of violence, and ultimately death. `` To me, the sculpture conveys notions of power and energy latent in the metal.'' She likes being called a pioneer, but is sorry she has no students to train. `` I'm sure huge strides could be made in this field if there were more of us,'' she said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: World Music for Peter Gabriel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years ago, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> bought his first drum machine. All he needed were rhythms to program. Bored with rock' n' roll, the former star of Genesis looked to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and elsewhere. He could n't believe what he was hearing, the freshest grooves, the richest harmonies: spirituals from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>; African jazz from <PERSON> Tabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Orquesta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reve </ORGANIZATION>, perfomers of `` son,'' the root of modern salsa. His music was never the same. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> began experimenting with rhythms on his 1982 album, `` Security'' -LRB- on one track, `` Rhythm of the Heat,'' he used a Ghanian drum section -RRB-, and the same year helped form the WOMAD -LRB- World of Music Arts and Dance -RRB- festival, gathering bands from more than 60 countries. Like the Rolling Stones, who went out of their way to praise the blues musicians who influenced their records, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> wanted to find a large audience for these exciting sounds. `` Grooves for me are physical things,'' explained the 39-year-old <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> recently to promote the release of four records on the new RealWorld label. `` They make me feel good. A bad disco groove, of which there's an awful lot, does n't make me want to dance. `` Some of the grooves we now take as commonplace rock have come from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They travel across the seas and become slightly different. I think quite often, white artists do n't quite get it right, and we end up coming out with a form which is new. The records just issued are `` Passion Sources,'' music from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> heard while putting together the soundtrack for `` The Last Temptation of Christ''; `` Shahen-Shah'' by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fateh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, one of the foremost singers of the devotional music called `` Qawwali''; `` La Explosion Del Memento'' by <PERSON> Orquestra </PERSON> <PERSON> Reve </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Tabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ley </PERSON>'s `` Babeti Soukous.'' `` We've tried to look for performers who have a lot of soul,'' <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> said. `` I think they have strong traditions in their own countries, it's sometime unfortunate that it gets all out under a ` World Music' label. You talk to the musicians themselves, and they say, ` What the hell is this world music?' I play my music, whatever it is.''' <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> is part world musician, part traveling salesman. He knows record buyers might never even look at the selections from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> without an old friend pointing the way. So if you happen to think of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> while listening to the infectious grooves of <PERSON> Tabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ley </PERSON>, well, at least that's a start. `` It's not me I'm selling, but someone else,'' he said. `` It's saying to people who are interested in my music that if you like my stuff, there's a chance you would like some of the things that really turn me on `` But it's not <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>'s label. It's a label in which I participate. We have a rule where everyone on our committee has to like everything that goes out.'' Lyrics are not included, forcing the listener to turn his or her attention away from the songs' literal meaning and concentrate instead on the emotions of the performance. In Qawwali, for instance, words are chanted over and over to a simple rhythm, giving them a hypnotic, mantra-like effect. `` There are ways which you get into a framework where everything you hear is music, which is probably a nice place to be,'' he said. `` You can really hear the emotion and humanity. So many intrumentalists are desperately trying to speak with their instruments, are trying to run the gamut of human emotions. `` You try to listen to their soul and the feeling that comes out of it. Some of these wonderful singers from all around the world are just capable of getting the hairs up in the back of my neck: That's what I look for.'' <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, of course, has one advantage over the average listener: He's actually met the people on the records. Not all the local musicians, however, were impressed by the presence of a world famous rock star. `` Half knew who I was, half had no idea. One of the Qawwali groups assumed I was a guy who worked around the studio and did n't know I was a musician When they found out I could play, they were a little bit curious.'' For <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> this music suits his political ideals as well. Regional tensions, he discovered, can crumble under the power of a universal language. One of the best evenings he had was when he was improvising with a Pakistani singer and sitar player <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON>, who's from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> played double violin. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> do n't normally work together and probably would n't have in other situations, but they really got turned on,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>. `` I was contributing, but in a subsidiary role. Now I'm going to do an album with the two of them. They started out not hostile, but suspicious of each other. By the end of it, they were in love, all in the space of 40 minutes.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Her Life Is Best Expressed Through Writing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> is an author, and a fairly popular one, too. But her mother wished she had taken a more secure job, such as stenography. Other family members agreed. The author can still remember her cousin, a nun, remarking how much she disliked her books. Even her beloved uncle criticized her work, calling it dirty. It's never stopped her, though. If <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> had never produced a single novel, she'd still write, perhaps keep a journal or diary, or make notes to herself if necessary. She would n't feel well otherwise; it's how she best expresses herself. Growing up in an Irish household uncomfortable with verbal communiation, writing was the only way she could imagine life outside her unhappy family. Her novels, `` Final Payments,'' `` Men and Angels'' and the new `` The Other Side'' -LRB- $ 19.95, Viking -RRB- are printed confessions, attempts at saying the unsayable, penetrations of characters who conceal their emotions. `` Irish culture does not value emotional display,'' the author said in a interview. `` So it certainly does n't value emotional articulateness. It values stoicism, it values silence and it values keeping things to yourself. `` I know that inarticulate people have very rich inner lives; they just do n't have the language for it. Some people who are educated or upper-middle-class assume that if you control language or own language, that means you have a finer inner life. But you can speak emotionally and not be revealing any true emotions.'' The imminent death of <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, in her 90s, brings together four generations in `` The Other Side.'' But this family seems only to share unhappiness. Infidelities, casual cruelty and emotional instability have made the <ORGANIZATION> McNamaras </ORGANIZATION> incapable of supporting each other, even at this time. `` I would n't know what to write about a good family,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` They do n't interest me as a writing problem. What are you going to say? ` They all got together, somebody took the leg of the chicken, somebody took the breast and somebody got the wing?' Who cares?'' But she ca n't resist a streak of creeping optimism. There's hope From <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, two of the <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> grandchildren who seek love outside their unhappy marraiges, and <PERSON> Darci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s playful daughter. `` I have a lot of faith in <PERSON> Darci </PERSON>. She's got juice and she's got pizzaz. Life is probably not going to be as wonderful and glorious as she thinks it is, but she's got life, she's got life force,'' the author said. `` I think what happens to you as a child, a young child, is tremendously important. I think feeling approved of, feeling loved, feeling safe, is something that ca n't be replaced. If you do n't have that, I think you're really crippled It's as if you had to learn to walk again as an adult.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s characters are weighted down by guilt, a belief that all earthly pleasure is undeserved, an exaggerated sense of duty. In `` Final Payments,'' a young woman shuts herself off from the outside world for years to nurse her sick father. The housekeeper in `` Men and Angels'' takes it upon herself to `` save'' her boss from the sins of humanity. Obligation drives <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>'s husband, to leave the nursing home where he had finally found happiness to fulfill a long-forgotten promise to be at his wife's side when she dies. `` The question of what do you owe people and what you allow for yourself is very vexing, and I think the Irish are very idealistic,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` They love the possibility of martyrdom looming somewhere in the future. `` They love the idea of a heroic goal that you can devote your life to. I think it's shaped their political life and it's shaped their literature.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, wrote poetry until age 25 and then started on `` Final Payments,'' which came out in 1978. She takes her characters through sickness and health, faith and despair, sex and religion. Vulnerability, the dependance on uncontrollable forces, fascinates <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, and terrorizes her as well. The uncomplicated joy of <PERSON> Darci </PERSON> is shadowed by <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, a once formidable woman reduced to desperate howls of pain. `` One of the terrible things about aging is the way that you lived does not matter nearly so much as the way you're going to die,'' she said. `` You can live a really rich, noble life and die like a jibbering animal. You can live like a total jerk and have a nothing life, but have a rather beautiful, peaceful death.'' Words beaten into sound, that's what happens to <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> as she nears death. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s characters struggle between language and emotion, and for most of their lives, language wins. But in the end, emotion resurfaces. As a writer, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> tries to weave them together. `` The rhythm of words and the physical existence of words is very important to me. I write very physically. To get the intensity of emotional experience into intensely connected language is a very, very big goal. `` I think there's always a problem with language. What does langauge actually reveal? The distance between what we want to say and what we are able to say is tragically great.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Kentucky Headhunters Get Your Attention</HEAD>

 You start with the name: the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Headhunters. Images of barefoot, spear-carrying ruffians in loincloth. `` It makes people think we're wild, naked hillbillies,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a member of the five-member band from <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, whose music is as intriguing as their name. The five are a newly signed recording group who play country, rock' n' roll, bluegrass, blues and jazz. `` We offer a blend of <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and Led <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, whose brother, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, also plays in the group. `` Basically what we're doing is taking bluegrass music and making it jazzy,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> has done it and all those people over there. They would take a bluegrass song and make it up-tempo.'' Now about the name. The group, nicknamed `` the Heads,'' took the name from a music term believed to have originated from the blues great Muddy Waters. The term `` headhunters'' apparently came about when Waters' band displaced local, less proficient groups as Waters' band toured the country. The proud Kentuckians added their state to the term and their memorable name was born. `` This is the first thing that catches everybody's attention,'' <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> says. Says Young: `` I called one guy at a radio station and he said he opened our record just because of the name. He said it sounded like something out of National Geographic.'' Adds group member <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> with a chuckle: `` We've got everybody scared to death. They think, ` Headhunters!''' The group, whose members are in their late 20s to mid-30s, has been together four years. Their first Mercury-Polygram album is `` Pickin' on <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'' and the first single released from the LP is `` Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine.'' The band consists of four guitars and drums and occasionally an harmonica. `` It's aggressive music, but it's a bunch of hillbillies playing it,'' <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> says. Drummer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s brother, says: `` We all grew up using the outhouse.'' `` We've all run out of toilet paper out there,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> adds. The band plays a mixture of music ranging from <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>'s `` Wait'til Tomorrow,'' to Cream's `` Crossroads,'' and country standards such as `` Oh Lonesome Me'' and `` <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flower </LOCATION>. They close their performances by saluting their home state with `` My Old <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Home.'' <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> adds an entertaining touch to their performances by pulling an array of props out of a trunk on stage. `` It's full of toys,'' he says. `` I've got water guns in there and I wet people down. I pull out a phone and talk to <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. I've got some magic tricks and I throw out cheap novelties to the crowd. He also juggles bowling pins. `` Four is the most I can do, and three is plenty.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> often plays drums shirtless, borrowing the idea from other drummers he's seen. It also saves time when he's through playing. `` I've been playing this way all my life. It gets hot back there and you do n't want to jump in the shower afterwards with your clothes on.'' Their instruments are as unpretentious as the musicians playing them. They've disdained state-of-the-art guitars and drums for instruments that are 20 years old and older. `` These drums are a complete different sound,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> says about his set, which has `` <ORGANIZATION> Metcalfe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'' proudly printed on them. `` I do n't ever remember tuning them.'' Before the <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> brothers joined the group, the band was known as Itchy Brothers. This name was borrowed from the King <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> cartoon show in which Itchy was King <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>'s evil brother. `` It was a good name,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> says. `` We thought about keeping it. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Headhunters are an extension of it.''

<HEAD>Congress Rethinking How Government Tallies Red Ink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bookkeeping issue that seemingly only an accountant could love is commanding keen interest on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The debate on how to tally the budget deficit could have big implications for Social Security. The deficit by law is defined as the difference between federal income and spending, including the billions earned and spent for Social Security benefits. So as the Social Security trust funds build big reserves to help pay for baby boomers' retirement in the next century, the official deficit tally is held down by payroll and employer taxes earmarked for Social Security benefits. Democrats and Republicans both are increasingly supporting taking Social Security's money-making trust funds out of the deficit equation, claiming that the current system masks the extent of the rest of the government's red ink. In fiscal 1988, for example, the government's $ 155 billion deficit would have been $ 194 billion if Social Security were excluded. In 1989, the official deficit fell to $ 152 billion; without <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, it was $ 204.5 billion. `` We are playing a game with the way we report the budget deficit each year,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> told colleagues in October. `` It seems to me it is time to ` fess up to what we are doing and do something about it. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., held up action on an urgent debt bill until congressional leaders agreed to tackle the deficit-definition issue early next year Those who favor removing Social Security from the equation say the unrealistically rosy budget picture removes pressure to cut the deficit, and that the move would help protect the trust fund reserves. `` What we're trying to do is stop the looting of that trust fund, and get truth in budgeting,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION> `` If we can save our Social Security trust fund surpluses, rather than spending them on government consumption as we do presently, we can more than double our net national savings rate,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, D-N. Critics maintain that removing Social Security from the equation would excuse a big chunk of the budget _ about 20 percent of federal spending _ from making more contributions toward reducing the deficit. They also say that once trust funds no longer are counted, politicians might spend the reserves on pet projects or bigger benefits for today's retirees, at the expense of tomorrow's. `` Every day, I and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> answer mail asking for benefit expansions by stating that we can not further improve benefits because of the budget deficit,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel recently `` This argument will be eliminated when Social Security becomes completely off-budget.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, shares that concern. `` It certainly would be harder to fend off proposals to raise benefits or cut payroll taxes without the discipline of deficit reduction,'' <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> told lawmakers. For example, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might have been unable to resist recent efforts to boost payments to `` notch babies'' _ Americans born in 1917 through 1921 _ who get lower benefits due to a change in the method of calculation. Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> calls the deficit-definition debate `` one of the most specious discussions you're ever going to find in government'' since it shifts numbers on paper without altering spending. Yet she is wary of tinkering with the system. `` I have a real concern if taking it off-budget means making it more vulnerable. To pull it out, there have got to be some safeguards built around that trust fund to ensure that nobody can raid it.'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> believes Social Security is better off left as it is, but he has introduced legislation to help protect the trust funds if they are removed from the deficit calculations. Under the bill, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member could object to any legislation that increased Social Security benefits without providing for a corresponding increase in revenues. Such an objection could be overruled only by a majority vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or by 60 votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Without such protections, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may not have `` the political courage to say ` no' to those proposals which would increase benefits immediately but at the same time further jeopardize our children's benefits.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> called <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s bill a step `` in the right direction,'' but said it was n't strong enough to adequately protect the trust funds. Accompanying the deficit-definition debate is the broader question of whether <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> should continue stockpiling money now to meet the big retirement demands of the baby boom generation. The General Accounting Office early in 1989 said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should consider rolling back payroll tax increases because the Social Security reserves are being used `` to finance the current operations of the government and are masking the size of the on-budget deficit.'' Returning Social Security to a `` pay-as-you-go'' system would involve reducing payroll taxes in the 1990s and raising them above scheduled levels in the next century, when benefit costs will rise as the baby boomers retire. `` This would eliminate the illusory buildup of reserves that now represents little more than a mechanism for using the payroll tax to finance the general operations of government,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Elderhostel Combines Travel, Education for Seniors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Youth might be wasted on the young, but education is n't. Inspired by the youth hosteling movement in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a Boston-based study-travel program called Elderhostel is booming. It offers a nearly overwhelming range of inexpensive courses for seniors at sites around the world. `` It gives me a chance to meet a bunch of people who I've never met before, who all have great things to contribute,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Stangel </PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who has attended <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION> programs since 1977. `` It gives me a terrific break from my normal routine. I would n't be without it.'' `` We thoroughly enjoy it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, 82, of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, has attended nine <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION> courses, both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. They've signed up for two more courses in 1990. Seniors can study marine life in <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>, culture in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, genealogy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Byzantine civilization in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, or other topics at more than 100 overseas locations. Or history, dance, theater, literature, biology, ecology, sports and other subjects at more than 1,200 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Courses are offered in all 50 states and all Canadian provinces. In fact, the range of programs can be daunting. The latest catalog is 144 pages, with a 40-page supplement, and reads like a good novel. `` It's a mistake to think of older adults as one market,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoob </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION>. `` We deliberately have an enormous variety of programs. Some are more rugged _ like hiking in the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION>. I'd like that, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.'' `` A lot of people go where their children or grandchildren are, or plan a vacation, and pop in an Elderhostel program along the way,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Karyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION> began in 1975, with 220 seniors taking courses at five colleges and universities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Its popularity has soared since. In 1989, 197,000 people took part at more than 1,400 locations in 42 countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian courses often begin on a Sunday afternoon and end the following Saturday morning, while overseas programs run two to three weeks. `` Some people go Elderhosteling across the country, taking five, six, seven, even thirteen courses in a row, `` Zoob said. Prices for domestic programs range from $ 230 to $ 275 per person, slightly more in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, double in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. That includes six nights' lodging, five days of courses, all meals and a variety of extra-curricular activities. <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION> also sponsors some `` hostelships,'' financial assistance which enables the very poor to attend nearby programs. Programs are limited to those 60 and older, but seniors can be accompanied by someone as young as 50. Accommodations are spartan, often consisting of two twin beds in a college dormitory, with bathrooms down the hall. Single rooms are sometimes available for an extra charge. The Elderhostel courses are not for credit, have no grades or exams, and except for intensive courses, no homework. The courses are designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of previous education. `` Just do it _ do n't let anything stop you,'' <PERSON> Stangel </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to have a college education, even though most of the programs are held at colleges. It's the experiences in your life that make you interesting.'' Weather sometimes affects programs, much as it does other travel plans, but participants give <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION> high marks for ingenuity. `` It poured rain all week, and we were supposed to be hiking through the woods,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who attended a program in the <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` But they were very imaginative. They brought in experts on acid rain, and birds, and whales. `` They really coped awfully well on the spur of the moment.'' Other Elderhostel travelers had the chance to see history being made on their latest trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crascenta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, spent the evening of June 3 in Tienanmen Square in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` It was a fascinating, but very sad, experience for us to see the marvelous progress <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has made in the past nine years, and then, in one night, see a turn of events that could spell disaster for continuing progress,'' she wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION>. Despite a rapid change in travel plans as <ORGANIZATION> Elderhostel </ORGANIZATION> students returned home early, some were still enthusiastic about the Chinese trip. `` I would like to encourage you to keep this program going,'' wrote <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` At no time did we feel threatened; we were always surrounded by concern for our well-being. `` The Chinese are a great people and I'm convinced that we need to learn from them as much as they need to learn from us.''

 The only thing wrong with retirement, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> says, is he ca n't get a day off. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, retired as a chemical engineer seven years ago. As a volunteer for the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>, he spends 10 hours a week advising small businesses on marketing and sales techniques. He also is a speaker for <ORGANIZATION> Gideons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes Bibles. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchell </PERSON>, who retired as an insurance consultant in 1981, coordinates monthly business seminars for SCORE. He has been a trustee for the Masons for three years and visits once a week with patients at <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s Heritage Program for Seniors. `` Some people think I'm driven, but I just get a big kick out of life,'' said <PERSON> Kitchell </PERSON>, 74, of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> may be getting more than just a kick out of life. `` We think differently as we get older, in a slower manner, and there is some memory loss which is a perfectly normal finding,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geriatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is some evidence that staying mentally active may actually help preserve brain function.'' Mental lethargy and its effects on good health can be seen most easily in nursing home patients, said Dr. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Overton </PERSON>, another gerontologist at Mercy. `` In nursing home patients, we see these pseudo dementias that are n't real dementias at all. You walk into a room and see a patient staring at the ceiling or the floor. And you think they've lost their minds but they have n't They're truly depressed,'' said <PERSON> Overton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> tells his patients to write down their talents and use them. `` Using one's talents is the epitome of mental activity which may prevent or slow down the changes in the aging brain. `` <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> did active research until the week before he died in his 70s. That shows you that we always have the capacity to learn more.'' <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, 79, of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, worked as an insurance secretary for 14 years until retirement in 1980. `` Now, I stay home as a last resort,'' said <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, who volunteers 15 to 20 hours a week at the Retired Senior Volunteer Program. Her rule is not to spend more time playing bridge than doing volunteer work. RSVP, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> program begun in 1972, matches volunteers with jobs in the community. Program director <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Wacker </PERSON> said its 1,100 volunteers donated 162,000 hours in fiscal 1988-89. <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> and other retirees at a senior housing building make teaching aids for children in the Head Start program. They fashion balls out of fabric scraps and nylon stockings and put together jump ropes by connecting red plastic loops. `` It is n't that I do n't like my own company, but actually it can get very stale if you're not out in the world to see what's happening That's how you make friends to ensure you have friends when you become an old lady,'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, 68, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Urbandale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, is on an RSVP committee that gives advice on planning for retirement. She was co-coordinator of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Peace Ribbon Project in 1984 and visited <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1986 for the International Women's Day and to learn about problems facing women there. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said she has retired at least six times, but ca n't make it stick. She stays involved `` to feel like I'm worth something, have something to offer and have a place in this world.'' <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaeger </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, raised two children after her divorce by working as a dental assistant. At age 60, she was forced out of her job when her boss retired. `` I tried to find work with another dentist but they all wanted to hire younger dental assistants,'' <PERSON> Yaeger </PERSON> said. She called the Retired Iowans Employment Program at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which placed 2,000 senior citizens in paying jobs last year. It helped her get a job as a receptionist at Crossroads, a seniors program. `` I learned to use one of these fancy memory typewriters. I learned how to get around that pretty well,'' she said. `` If you stay home you become a couch potato with your soap operas and you just do n't think like you did before. `` I'll work as long as my health holds out.''

 Ah, the stories they can tell. About a man obsessed with the education of his children. Or a love story with <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> as a backdrop. Or building a homestead in the early 1900s. `` A lot of us do memory pieces and if they're not entirely memory we might write fiction based on things we've known,'' said writer <PERSON> Garnet </PERSON> <PERSON> Garoni </PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>. `` There is n't a very big market for that type of story, but it's really fun to write.'' Not a big market, maybe, but Mrs. <PERSON> Garoni </PERSON> and other older New Mexicans have found an outlet in Serape, an annual anthology of poetry and short stories by senior citizens. Published by <ORGANIZATION> Nightjar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Serape first appeared on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> bookshelves in 1983, the result of a creative writing class at a Las Cruces senior center. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlvoy </PERSON>, an associate professor of English at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, is n't proud that he was surprised at the caliber of writing he found among students at Munson Senior Citizen's Center. But his thinking took a quick, sharp turn. `` I thought, ` Gee, this is powerful writing,''' says <PERSON> McIlvoy </PERSON>, who still teaches the weekly class. `` It's so strong, so powerful and so informed by those years of experience that I really wanted it to be brought to readers.'' Serape's early issues contained work by class members, but more recent editions have been open to older writers throughout the state. Some 30 pieces of work by 15 authors _ all of them 55 or older _ appear in the sixth edition of `` Serape,'' scheduled for release this month. It will be the fourth time Mrs. <PERSON> Garoni </PERSON>'s work has been published in `` Serape.'' `` Miracles Do Happen,'' a short, fictional story about a girl who leaves a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> town for the bright lights of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Really one of my own thoughts about <PERSON> Serape </PERSON> is what we're doing is giving exposure to people whose names are not already recognizable, but who are certainly doing important work,'' <PERSON> McIlvoy </PERSON> said. He and editors <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, retirees whose work has appeared in <LOCATION> Serape </LOCATION>, waded through 64 manuscripts of about 25 pages each before making the wrenching final selections for the 1989 edition. `` We get quite a massive pile of material,'' <PERSON> McIlvoy </PERSON> said. The pile could become even more massive if he is able to expand the anthology to include older writers from throughout the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. McIlvoy proposed the idea to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> State officials while also telling them the expansion would require higher production standards and more pages _ and therefore more funding. Serape, which sells for $ 6 and can be purchased at bookstores around the state or from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, now is funded mainly through sales and by the university, with 10 percent coming from donors and patrons. `` Teaching at the <ORGANIZATION> Munson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, as I have done for the last six years, and editing this anthology are for me the most important, stimulating things that I do,'' <PERSON> McIlvoy </PERSON> said. `` I work with extremely talented young writers here at the university, but the old cliche applies _ there's no replacing experience.''

<HEAD>Maker of Ping Golf Clubs Learns Life's Big Lessons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Solheim </PERSON> _ millionaire, engineer and golf club designer _ can trace his business philosophy to the years during the Depression when he ran a shoe repair shop because he could n't afford to stay in college. When one of his two competitors on a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> street corner reduced the price of heels to 15 cents, Solheim followed suit. `` The first customer that came in asked me, ` Is that as good as it used to be?' Of course, I had to say yes. When the next two customers asked the same question, I decided most people were more interested in quality than price. I took my sign down and resumed charging 35 cents for heels.'' That observation was reinforced when he noticed that people would generally choose from the most expensive pile of leather on the counter. `` Again I found most people were more interested in quality than in price. That's stuck with me all my life,'' said Solheim, 77. Indeed, golfers are willing to pay about one-third more for his Ping custom-fitted putters and irons _ `` ping'' was the sound the first putters made. They were used by more than 200 pros in 1989 and netted $ 80 million in sales. Some of Solheim's other lessons came from his father, a shoemaker who immigrated with his family from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. From him, Solheim learned hard work and `` a skill I would n't have had otherwise _ how to use my hands. `` So when I came to making my clubs it was second nature.'' It also was the way he made ends meet before the approach of World War II enabled him to return to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. By 1945, he was a flight research engineer; by 1951, a project engineer on the Atlas missile; and by 1953 he began a long association with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> as an engineer. It was around then he decided he could afford to take up golf. He was terrible. At first he blamed himself, but golf would never be the same after he concluded that the clubs were the problem and set out to design better ones. The earliest Ping putters were good for a laugh because the looked like a `` hot dog on the end of a stick.'' The design concept came from tennis rackets, which have the weight on the rim while the strings give the power. A putter based on that theory would let a golfer miss a little and still hit straight, Solheim concluded. `` I made them ugly on purpose so they'd be accepted for their worth, not appearance.'' He improved his game until he carried a five handicap _ something most golfers would like. It's now 18, but an eye problem keeps him off the links. `` When he was starting, he used to sit around the practice green with a bunch of putters, hoping some of the pros would try them,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goalby </PERSON>, the 1968 Masters champion. `` One day he had holes in his shoes. And somebody asked me, ` Who's that guy over there with those weird putters and holes in his shoes? What's he doing here? Did you every see anything worse than that?' `` But he never became discouraged or angry. He'd listen to what guys would say after trying his putters, take their criticism to heart, go back and change them, come back the next day or next tournament and say, ` What do you think of this one now?' And guys started saying, ` Hey, <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON>, let me try that one.' But he sure took some heat at first.'' From building clubs in his garage, Solheim's privately held <ORGANIZATION> Karsten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has grown to employ 1,700 people in 22 buildings covering several blocks. He received an `` E'' award during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for increasing trade with foreign companies _ tiny flags of 77 countries where Ping clubs are sold are displayed in the headquarters lobby. In the early days Solheim would test the wind drag of a club's swing by holding various models out the window of his car while traveling at high speed Now he has a sophisticated machine to measure drag, and other equipment is so state-of-the-art that plant tours are limited and security tight. `` I think <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> is a genius as far as making golf clubs and equipment,'' said <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who has used Pings since 1967. When the factory was making a new set for him in April he was given a tour. `` The quality control is the best I've ever seen. But what impressed me more than anything was you could go anywhere in the facility and you could sit down on the floor and have your lunch, it was that clean. And all the employees seemed happy. Everyone was very, very friendly and accommodating,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. Life is teaching Solheim a new lesson, however. After more than a million sets of Ping Eye2 irons were sold, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has banned them in the 13 <ORGANIZATION> USGA </ORGANIZATION> championships starting Jan. 1 and in practically all play beginning in 1996. The <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golfers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is also questioning the clubs, but is banning all similar clubs, not just Pings. The organizations say the shape of the grooves _ square or ` U' - shaped instead of a ` V' _ and their spacing give stronger golfers an unfair advantage in backspin _ giving better control to stop a ball from rolling, Solheim in August filed a federal lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> USGA </ORGANIZATION> and others, alleging slander and violation of antitrust laws, and seeking an injunction and damages in excess of $ 100 million. `` It'd be easy enough for me to change the clubs, but I have to think of all those people who've bought them. It would n't be fair to my customers. And I do n't want to destroy the performance of the clubs either,'' he said. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> USGA </ORGANIZATION> is asking for and what the rules say are not the same. `` The irony is there is a greater difference between dimples on balls than there is between the clubs. That's where the big difference is. But they do n't have to change anything. Where in the world will you go and find somebody who wants something that's 95 percent good when they can have it 100 percent? `` How could I run a business with that kind of ambition?''

 If <ORGANIZATION> Jaguars </ORGANIZATION> and diamonds are a little pricey and store-bought baubles are n't personal enough for those on your list, gifts fresh from your kitchen in attractive reusable containers make doubly delightful presents. The time, thoughtfulness and care that go into something hand-made touch us all, and part of the pleasure is looking for reusable containers. I've found them in all sorts of places. Import-export stores have pottery, glass, baskets, from all over the world. A thrift or antique shop may unearth a charming tray or vintage <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> jars, and local artisans offer one-of-a-kind pieces for the kitchen and home that will be treasured for years. Anything will be happily received, from a cut glass cruet for your homemade vinegar to a tiny, tiered jewelry box with each drawer filled with tantalizing two-bite confections. When it comes time to stir things up in the kitchen, be sure to include your grandchildren, or any small children for that matter. The sights, sounds and smells enliven the creative spirit, and simple tasks such as helping stuff dates and rolling out cookies are just the ticket. They can have the fun of making a present for a teacher or treats for stocking-stuffers. Following are some suggestions for your Christmas or Hannukkah table and for gift-giving. This holiday season we most certainly want to offer the precious gift of our time to programs in church, synagogue or school to cook and serve a holiday meal to people without the warmth and love of home and hearth and family.

<TEXT>
 I count three tools as indispensable in my garden: the spading fork, the trowel and the pen. True, my pen has got an advanced degree now and dresses up as a computer, wooing me with fancy tricks. But basically, it does the same work. Sure, you can garden without records, but many of us come to rely on and enjoy the day-by-day jottings that chart our successes and failures over years. On a spring day in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1766, 22-year-old <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> scribbled, `` March 30. Purple hyacinth begins to bloom.'' Thus began a notebook he found time for even during his presidency. A farmer as well as a gardener, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> was a painstaking notekeeper. For eight years, he tabulated the earliest and latest appearance of 37 vegetables on the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> market. Most importantly, a notebook profiles the individual garden, establishing the right times and places to plant things and reminding you when to dust or fertilize. Your plot differs from your neighbor's in soil, moisture, slant of sun, hours of shade. You may get a killing frost while a garden 50 yards down the road escapes. You ca n't steer only by directions on seed packets or in manuals; they're too generalized. By keeping careful notes, I learned the best time to plant <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts. Conventionally, in my area 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, you're advised to plant in late July. But my plants did n't make enough growth then. The middle of June turned out best, giving me nice sprouts in time to benefit from the hard October frosts that vastly improve their taste. Then, some plant varieties do well in your garden and others do n't. You may be better off staying with your tried-and-true plants rather than going for the newest hybrids. With dozens of varieties to track, your notebook keeps a much better record of trials and errors than you could hope to in your memory. Notes, or sketches, also will remind you where you put what when. Some plants, like the cabbage family, need to be moved around from year to year to prevent disease. Many things go into a gardening diary. Little mystery stories may unfold. Looking at my 1983 notes, I see my asparagus tips suddenly developed a chewed look. Slug bait did nothing at all. Nor was it a strange disease. The culprit _ I caught him at it _ turned out to be a woodchuck that got over the fence. On Oct. 4, 1987, we had the earliest snowfall in my memory, interesting for my diary because my beans and other tender crops survived. My word processor has tidied up my record-keeping immensely. The `` insert'' and `` delete'' enable me to correct, rewrite and edit as I go along. At the end of the year, I give the diary a touch-up, print it and bind it in a notebook. If you're a computer buff, you can move up to database record-keeping, letting you look at your garden from numerous perspectives. Creating a database is painstaking work and it takes a while to accumulate a significant amount of data. But eventually you can ask your computer, for example, what flowers you have grown that bloom in the shade, what kind of soil they like and when to plant them. Or how many European lettuces you've grown over the years. Push a couple keys and the computer will respond with names, dates, country of origin and anything else you wanted to record about the lettuce. And it will do it in various formats, giving you, say, only French lettuces, or slow-bolting ones. Big deal, you might say, but you get your answers instantly and it's fun to do. And it's up to you to create the variety and penetration of searches. If you have a computer but lack the time or patience to build your own database, you can get ready-made gardening programs that combine note-keeping with instruction and graphics. You can file away sketches of your garden as it looked from year to year, thus helping you to rotate your crops. Your zip code tells the program what plants are feasible for your area. For the non-computer minded, there are special notebooks for the garden. Whether you work with pen or computer, keeping notes, like digging in the dirt, is hard but brings special rewards.

<HEAD>Board Game Built Around Life in Retirement Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new board game built around real-life situations from nursing and retirement homes around the country is designed to help people who work with the elderly solve problems and be more understanding. The Game of Aging Concerns asks participants to discuss how they would deal with challenges and crises that come up in homes for the elderly. For example, one game card instructs players to role-play a situation in which an administrator is talking with a group of residents who are demanding the ouster of an unmarried man and woman who live together. Another card asks the player to discuss how to help an elderly man whose wife died two years earlier and feels he has nothing left to live for. A third asks what to do about a 72-year-old man who is intoxicated when he comes to the dining room and acts belligerant and disruptive. The game was developed for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> for the Aging by <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmall </PERSON>, a gerontologist at <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who based the game cards on more than 1,000 situations submitted by retirement housing officials. The <ORGANIZATION> AAHA </ORGANIZATION> decided to produce the game after test groups reported that it helped stimulate discussions about challenges that arise in retirement homes, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>. `` This is kind of a fun departure from the typical lecture and book-learning training.'' <PERSON> Schmall </PERSON> also has developed board games called Sex and Aging and Families and Aging to help people understand issues related to the elderly. `` It's a technique that works well in terms of problem-solving and helping people to step into the shoes of older adults. It really encourages interaction and getting people to look at situations from a variety of perspectives.'' The game is available for $ 30 plus $ 3 per game for shipping and handling from <ORGANIZATION> AAHA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> for the Aging, 1129 20th <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NW </ORGANIZATION>, Suite 400, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20036-3489.

<HEAD>Many Cut Back on Necessities to Handle Money Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than one-fourth of older Americans cut back on basic necessities such as food, energy or medical care because of `` money problems,'' according to a government survey of married couples age 55 and older. Energy consumption, including heat and hot water, was the most frequent cutback, followed closely by food, with medical care reduced by substantially fewer households, said the report in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. It said 14.5 percent of households surveyed reduced on one of the three necessities, 6.9 percent cut back on two, and 5.2 percent cut back all three. `` Health or safety problems are likely to be a very real possibility for some households who cut back on food purchases, heat or hot water, or medical care,'' the report said. It also found that 31 percent of older households cut back on entertainment because of financial strains, suggesting that `` when older consumers are faced with the need to cut back, discretionary areas are likely to be cut first.'' The report was based on an analysis of 2,480 married couples included in the 1983 Survey of Aging Veterans by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Since then, shelter, energy and medical care have been significant sources of inflation. `` The difficulties that the older consumers were experiencing in 1983 _ and which led to cuts by a substantial proportion of households in one or more basic consumption areas _ likely have persisted over time,'' it said. In addition, married-couple households generally are better off economically than older consumers in general.

 A proposed deal that would give a Soviet research institute an equity stake in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> biotechnology company could lead to the commercialization of Soviet scientific advances, experts said. `` It comes in the context of a new Soviet policy to integrate with the world economy, so it could be the beginning of a trend,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Surovell </PERSON>, editor of a newsletter that monitors Soviet trade.

If the deal is approved, <ORGANIZATION> Transgene </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to commercialize the technology and sell it to all but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries.

 The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen for the seventh consecutive trading day today and prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> also rose slightly. The dollar closed at 144.65, up 0.38 yen from its 144.27 yen close on Friday. It opened at 144.50 yen and ranged between 144.45 yen and 144.73 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency now has climbed 1.75 yen in seven trading days. Its higher opening resulted from its surge last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where it closed at 144.25 on Friday, and from tightened demand for a large number of export contracts usually due for settlement on Mondays, dealers said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> was believed to have stepped into the market several times, selling dollars to keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency within a narrow range, said <PERSON> Kaneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The central bank does not comment on its exchange market activities. <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> said market activity was likely to trail off toward the end of the month, with dealers unwilling to take large positions before the new year. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues gained 28.61 points, or 0.08 percent, closing at 37,752.67. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> fell 134.05 points after closing at record highs on 11 of the preceding 12 trading days. Trading started slowly today as investors waited to see the market's performance after its strong advances last week, traders said. After opening lower, the Nikkei rebounded toward the end of the morning session on renewed buying of resource-related and incentive-backed issues, dealers said. The large amount of funds flowing into the market from institutional and corporate investors prevented a major decline from profit-taking, they said. Investors are watching currency markets carefully out of concern that a renewed surge of the dollar against the yen could provoke an interest rate hike, said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of W.I. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s equity sales. Volume was estimated at 700 million shares, down from an estimated 1 billion shares Friday.

 `` Sparky'' may be the trendy new house pet of the'90s. He wo n't bite the mailman or howl at the moon. He's bigger than a cat but smaller than a Doberman. He does n't shed, smell or claw the furniture, and prefers a tidy litterbox to the living room rug. He'll walk on a leash, swim, fetch or just sit and watch TV. And the worst thing you can say about him? Well, he's a pig. A Vietnamese potbellied pig. These pygmy porkers have become popular pets in the last couple of years, despite hefty prices, ranging from about $ 1,500 for a neutered male to $ 35,000 for a pregnant female. Pig owners boast their pets learn quickly and have sunny dispositions. They do n't get really big _ full-grown, they weigh between 20 and 150 pounds -LRB- as compared to hogs, which can weigh half a ton -RRB-. But right now, just about the only way to acquire a Vietnamese potbelly is to get plugged into the nationwide breeders network. That's where <PERSON> Sparky </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, comes in. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> breeds and sells Vietnamese potbellied pigs through her company, <PERSON> Paradise </PERSON> <PERSON> Pigs </PERSON>, and keeps her customers updated on pig care and feeding through a homey newsletter. -LRB- From a recent issue: `` It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unsure of how much to feed your piggies, and some are even letting them ` pig out' -LRB- pun intended -RRB-.'' -RRB- <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> is also about to launch Pet Pig Update, which she bills as `` the first magazine devoted to miniature pet pigs!'' And she was recently elected to the board of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potbellied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. As one of a handful of Vietnamese potbellied pig breeders, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> is particularly concerned about keeping the animals' bloodlines pure while not inbreeding them Virtually all the Vietnamese potbellies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are descended from a group of 18 brought in through <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1983 by <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>. There are several pig registries nationwide which certify how closely related the animals are to the original group. But <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> says some breeders _ anxious to cash in on the growing market _ cross their Vietnamese potbellies with other strains. The resulting pigs are not as small or good-tempered or healthy as the real thing, she says. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> got interested in the pint-sized pigs by accident; she had been trying to get a skunk to keep her cat company and applied for several exotic animal permits. `` Once I got all the permits, I was on mailing lists and I started getting ads for zebras and giraffes and things,'' she said in a recent interview. `` I just was watching the pigs in those trade magazines. And I really liked the idea because, well, pigs just make really great pets but they're also a pet that anybody can have. Most of the pets that are unusual you ca n't have unless you have a farm. The pigs you can have in an apartment.'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> speaks from experience. Until recently, she had been breeding pigs in a two-bedroom condo in suburban <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, and at one point had 23 of them. But she and her husband, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>, are moving to <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, where they will raise pigs and other exotic animals on a farm. Their breeding pigs are already there. In the meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> Bryants </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sparky </PERSON> are sharing quarters with a ferret, a tabby cat, a tank of goldfish in the house and, oddly, a bathtub filled with more fish outside on the balcony. During a visit, 4-month-old <PERSON> Sparky </PERSON> trundled around the living room and grunted softly before hopping on the couch to snuggle up. He weighs about 15 pounds and feels like a bristly, wiggly football with a warm, rubbery snout. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> ca n't say enough good about her pigs, but she confessed they have two weaknesses: food and telephones. Pigs will overeat, so <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> recommends a strict diet of mini pig chow. They also like treats like peanuts, raisins and fruits. As for the telephone, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said, `` They like to knock it off the hook and push the buttons. It's cute but it's annoying.'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> has a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> permit to breed the pigs but she said no special permission was needed in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to keep them as pets. However, some localities classify all pigs as livestock, so it's important for would-be owners to make sure they can keep pigs as pets.

 A tentative decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to ban the EBDC pesticides widely used on many important food crops may erupt as a major 1990 agricultural issue on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The agency proposed a week ago to halt the use of <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> on 45 food products, including tomatoes, potatoes, bananas and lettuce. Critics of the plans say it will boost consumer food prices and cause hardships for growers. Used by farmers since the 1930s to combat fungus and mildew, the pesticides _ which include some such as Maneb and <PERSON> Zineb </PERSON> familiar to home gardners _ have been linked to cancer. Although hailed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as a move to protect consumers, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announcement is producing some concerns as it gradually sinks in. For example, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on domestic marketing, consumer relations and nutrition, has been contacted by farm groups in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> who are concerned about the planned curb on EBDCs Press Secretary <PERSON> Krista </PERSON> <PERSON> Harden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> is consulting with a state coalition that has formed around the EBDC issue and may hold hearings on the subject when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns in January. `` The ban is too severe,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Peavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, which sells fertilizer to local farmers. `` We fear we are going to fall in the same category as the apple people with Alar.'' <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said he fears area farmers will stop producing without <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> and that will hurt his fertilizer business. The product is the main fungicide used on leafy vegetables, said <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON>, who said it can easily be washed off. `` But if you ate the plant without washing it you would have to eat 13,000 pounds of it to get the amount the rat had on the test,'' said <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON>. He said the coalition of producers and agribusinessmen he is leading, which calls itself the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to stop the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from removing EBDC from the market. He said the group is contacting <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s two senators and congressmen from farm areas. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where potatoes are high on the financial menu, Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> advised his state's congressional delegation in letters that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decision is causing havoc. `` We need a competent, credible <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to deal with the multitude of environmental concerns,'' he said. `` We do not need an agncy that deals in scare tactics and misinformation.'' Much of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s case against <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> rests on laboratory tests that show a byproduct of the fungicide called ETU causes cancer in animals and likely causes cancer in humans if lifelong exposure is significant. Health experts say chronic exposure to <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> also raises the risks of birth defects or thyroid disorders. In September, manufacturers of <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> announced they would voluntarily halt sales of the fungicide for use on 42 food products at the end of this year, accounting for about 40 percent to 50 percent of the total sold annually. However, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said on Dec. 4 that the voluntary ban does n't go far enough and should be extended to tomatoes, potatoes and bananas, which together account for nearly one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> used. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, nominally the governmental voice and defender of American farmers, has been quiet since the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announcement. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in a statement defending the plan to cancel some of the EBDC pesticides. The statement expressed confidence that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers can `` continue to eat fruits and vegetables'' without fearing the potential risks of the chemicals, at least until an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> market basket survey is completed in 1991 to determine how much of the <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> are potentially present. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has not elaborated beyond that statement since <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced its plan. Sen. <PERSON> Patrict </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called for `` a wholesale reform of our pesticide laws'' instead of `` tentative half steps'' that may take years to accomplish But Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, warned against a further tightening of federal restrictions. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> curb on fungicides is just a beginning, he told the state's <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` EPA now has a bit in its teeth, and they are running,'' he said. `` They will push as far as they can go, and they will test to see how far they can push.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest farm organization, offered guarded comment. It is appropriate, said federation president <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, to review the EBDC situation, but a ban on the use of some of the fungicides would pose hardships for many. `` Crops, especially those grown in humid regions, are vulnerable to fungal diseases, such as mold, mildew, rot and scab,'' he said. `` There are simply no satisfactory alternatives for many of the prescribed EBDC uses.'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> cited a recent study by <ORGANIZATION> GRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, consulting firm, which concluded the loss of all fungicides would reduce fruit production by 32 percent and vegetables by 21 percent. Consumer food prices would rise 13 percent, overall, the study said.

<HEAD>Taiwan Group to Acquire Wyse Technology</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An investment group of government and local enterprises has agreed to acquire the California-based computer products company <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a cash deal valued at $ 268 million, both groups announced today. The buyout would be the largest ever of a foreign firm by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> group, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would buy all <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>'s shares for $ 10 each, said <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-fu </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest investor in the buyout. `` The acquisition is an important step for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s electronics and computer industries to enter the world market,'' <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> said his group would use <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>'s sales channels and technology personnel to promote <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s high-technology products. <PERSON> Koo </PERSON>'s company will offer 29 percent of the capital for the investment. The acquisition also was supported by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, which offered 20 percent of the total investment from a development fund. Other investors include <ORGANIZATION> Mitac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION>, a local computer manufacturer, and two petrochemical companies. The acquisition, which was approved by <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>'s board of directors, is expected to be completed next week. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, holds about a 50 percent market share for general-purpose terminals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It also produces monitors and IBM-compatible personal computers. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> officials began a search for buyers earlier this year after the 8-year-old company suffered a loss of $ 21 million in the 1989 fiscal year ended March 31, compared with a $ 28 million profit the previous year. <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse </PERSON> said the acquisition `` provides shareholders an opportunity to maximize the value of their shares at this time.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the group's main objective will be to improve business He said he was confident demand for computer terminals would remain strong. Taiwanese businessmen have shown growing interest in acqusition of foreign firms, which they believe could help boost their business in the world market. Last month, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, proposed to use <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s foreign reserves of about $ 73 billion for loans to local enterprises for overseas acquisitions.

<HEAD>Government's Latest Sale is 5.7 Times Oversubscribed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's $ 8.3 billion sale of its water industry was 5.7 times oversubscribed, attracting the second highest number of applicants for a British privatization, officials said Monday. Demand for shares of the 10 water authorities of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> was strong enough to trigger `` clawback'' provisions that will give small investors nearly half the stock instead of the previously planned 27 percent. Most investors will get far fewer shares than they asked for in the sale, which totals 5.24 billion pounds. `` It is a great success,'' Environment Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` We have proved our critics wrong.'' Some 2.7 million people made applications, the second highest response ever for a government privatization after the 4.5 million applicants in British <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> sale. There had been concern that the sale would be unsuccessful because the stock market has been in the doldrums and the privatization has faced stiff opposition from critics who believed such a vital utility should remain government-owned. Trading in the shares officially begins Tuesday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> In the `` gray,'' or unofficial, market the shares were trading at 126 pence, or $ 1.99, at midday Monday. The government is selling 2.183 million shares at 240 pence, or $ 3.79, each but investors only put 100 pence down and pay the rest off in installments. Under the `` clawback'' provisions in the water sale, institutional investors now will get 39 percent of the shares, and foreign investors the remainder. Each investor everyone will get at least 100 shares. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government has sold off billions of pounds worth of state-owned companies in the past decade to promote capitalism in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

Most of the 1990 reductions will occur in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> division, which has 37,600 workers and runs <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's long-distance network, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Employees were told on Nov. 28 of plans to reduce the division staff by 6,000 jobs. Additionally, the company plans to cut 700 jobs in its <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> unit, 1,400 jobs in its <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> unit, and 400 jobs in its <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> unit, which supplies office phone services to big businesses, has 15,000 workers while the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division, which handles phone service for smaller companies, has 11,200 workers. <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Services has 8,700 workers. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said advances in technology have been behind much of the job cutting at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. The company envisioned thousands of cuts as it upgrades its long-distance phone network to a more efficient digital system by the end of next year, for instance. The big communications company has intensified its efforts to steamline operations lately by automating factories and back-office facilities and by breaking itself down into smaller, more focused units. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has almost frozen hiring and instead has redeployed existing staff into vacant positions. `` We're on a drive to right-size this place to be competitive,'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlingame </PERSON>, vice president of human resources at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, told the Journal. `` Our managers are quickly learning that they must focus on costs, customers and competitors.'' Most of this year's cuts have come through early retirement or attrition, but several thousand have come through unannounced cuts. Since 1984 when the company divested its regional operating companies, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has cut about 90,000 jobs. The company will have a payroll of about 280,000 employees by January.

 College graduates this spring will make more money, but find fewer job opportunities, according to a survey of nearly 500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers. Hires will be down 13.3 percent compared to last year, according to the 19th annual survey by <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Career </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> office. The average starting salary for a graduate with a bachelor's degree will be $ 25,256, up 3.3 percent from a year ago The expected starting salary for master's of business administration graduates will be $ 39,840, a 3.1 percent increase; $ 33,740 for master's degree graduates, up 3.3 percent; and $ 37,111 for graduates with doctoral degrees, a 2.4 percent increase. As in recent years, engineering majors will get the highest starting salaries for new college graduates, with chemical engineering leading the way at $ 33,380. Mechanical engineering ranks second at $ 32,256, while electrical engineering is at $ 32,107; computer science $ 31,389, and industrial engineering $ 30,557. The lowest starting salaries will be for graduates in human ecology-home economics, $ 18,157; journalism, $ 18,255; natural resources, $ 18,840; retailing, $ 18,909, and advertising, $ 19,662. The survey released Sunday was based on responses from 479 employers in business, industry, government, and educational institutions. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheetz </PERSON>, who directed the study, said reasons for the drop in planned hiring included limited growth in new business; mergers and buyouts; increased global competition; and slow turnover of current employees. Employers expected to have large hiring increases include: public utilities, up 29.4 percent; metal products, up 24.2 percent; petroleum, 22.1 percent; construction and building materials manufacturing, 19.3 percent; printing, publishing and informational services, 13.7 percent. Those expected to have decreases included automotive and mechanical equipment, down 58 percent; electronics, 24.5 percent; government administration, 20.9 percent; aerospace, 20 percent; the military, 16.8 percent; and diversified conglomerates, 13.7 percent. The survey also found: _ The greatest job opportunities are in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Next best is the Northeast, followed by the Southeast, North-Central, South-Central, and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> states. _ Employers requiring drug testing of new college graduates rose to 47 percent of those surveyed, up from 32 percent last year and 27 percent the year before. Testing for alcohol was required by 25 percent of those surveyed, up from 14 percent. Testing for AIDS was required by 4 percent of employers, a slight increase of 3 percent for the 1988-89 graduates.

<HEAD>The '80s As the Money Decade: Free Enterprise Gets Free Rein</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the 1970s was the Me Decade, the 1980s was the Money Decade. Free enterprise got free rein in the early years, driving the economy ahead and making billionaires out of characters as diverse as software entrepreneur <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and junk-bond wizard <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. But that unbridled pursuit of wealth turned Americans queasy well before the end of the decade. Ambition fostered as much greed as achievement, and great successes often were matched one-for-one by crises. The economy's durable growth was threatened by an overhang of debt. The bull market produced scandals and a Black Monday crash. Go-go lending led to a savings and loan debacle. For the business world, it was a decade of revolution followed by reaction in three main arenas: political, technological and financial. Politically, the decade began on Jan. 20, 1981, the day the hostages came home from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office promising `` to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden.'' Within months, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> broke an illegal strike by the air traffic controllers union and proposed a giant tax cut. That same year, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rolled out its first personal computer in a strike against young <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. With <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s blessing, the PC changed from a futuristic gadget into a deadly serious business tool In finance, jut-browed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, just 35 in 1981, was using high-yielding `` junk'' bonds to raise money for companies shunned by traditional bond buyers _ companies like fast-growing <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s baggy-eyed gladiator, used junk bonds and the federal courts in an assault on the world's largest company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> In 1982, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> succumbed to government antitrust lawyers and agreed to the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. The walls were tumbling down. Across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was dismantling British socialism with a vengeance. Markets became freer as well in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which envisioned a true common marketplace by 1992, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which grew into a global economic powerhouse. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the buoyant new spirit was best understood in contrast with the 1970s, a brutal decade marred by the Vietnam War, Watergate, two oil-price shocks, stagflation and ineffective government tinkering with the economy. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had tried wage and price controls. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had passed out WIN buttons, promising to Whip Inflation Now. As late as 1980, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was trying to discipline the economy with the first peacetime credit controls in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, including curbs on the use of credit cards. Banks' prime lending rate briefly topped 21 percent in 1980 and the price of gold, an inflation refuge, surpassed $ 800 an ounce. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came into office with a radically different agenda, convinced that cutting tax rates would unleash so much economic activity that tax revenue would actually increase. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> had sketched out the supply-side theory on a napkin in 1974. It did n't happen exactly as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wished. The tax cuts produced fat budget deficits. Fortunately for him, though, budget deficits are painless, at least in the short run. The pain was inflicted by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, the stern, 6-foot-7 chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, who pushed up interest rates to squeeze out inflation. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s medicine produced the deepest recession since World War II, with unemployment rates topping 10 percent in the summer of 1982. But it did wring inflationary expectations out of the system, and by that November, the economy began an expansion that continues to this day, the longest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peacetime history. In contrast to the inward-looking Me Decade, Americans looked outward in the'80s because the business world demanded it. The old order was fractured and they were forced to make new choices. Fixed-rate mortgage or adjustable? IRA or 401 -LRB- k -RRB-? AT & amp; T or <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> or Sprint? <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had launched deregulation, in airlines, trucking and banking, but it was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who became the movement's spiritual godfather. The Money Decade made economic creatures of us all. Business news leaped to the front page. Financial News Network was born. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> became a best-selling author. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' were voyeuristic hits. Americans exulted in capitalism in the early'80s, none more than <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who built an empire by buying savings and loans and speculating with the money deposited in them. By 1989, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> faced accusations that he had looted or abused depositors' funds while bribing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators with political donations. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s downfall capped a series of events beginning in the mid-1980s that turned many Americans against the excesses of the decade. All three revolutions _ political, financial and technological _ were in some way tarnished. In 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, world champion of free enterprise, became a net debtor for the first time since the eve of World War I. In November 1986, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> surrendered $ 100 million and agreed to plead guilty to a felony as a budding government probe of insider trading sideswiped Wall Street's roaring bull market. On Oct. 19, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average plunged a record 508 points, intensifying concerns about the health and fairness of the markets. In 1988, Americans learned that the previous year's trade deficit had hit a record $ 152 billion _ a hemorrhage of $ 4,800 a second. The crowning blow came in 1989, when taxpayers found out that the deregulated and fraud-riddled savings and loan industry would require a $ 159 billion bailout. It began to seem the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution had not kept the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from digging itself into a deep hole of debt; that untrammeled markets could get dangerously out of balance; and that deregulation had opened the cookie jar to shameless thieves. Even the long-lived economic expansion was less impressive when it became apparent how little it had done to raise living standards. After adjustment for inflation, hourly earnings of non-supervisory workers actually were lower throughout the 1980s than in 1969.

 Thus came the reaction. In politics, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> belied his free-trading reputation by signing legislation protecting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> steel, autos, textiles and sugar. His administration quit its laissez-faire attitude toward the overvalued dollar, which threatened to gut American industry by making imports a better buy than goods made in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> Government supervision of the savings and loans was toughened and there were moves toward re-regulation of airlines, cable television, the financial markets, clean air and job safety. Meanwhile, each foreign purchase of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institution _ <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Burger King _ brought fresh calls for restrictions on foreign ownership. The more liberal lawmakers even dared call for an industrial policy _ a coordinated program for rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic strength that sounded to conservatives like wasteful `` lemon'' socialism. By late in the decade, polls showed Americans viewed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as a bigger threat than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, proof that the Money Decade had wrought changes in attitudes about money and power. In finance, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s revolution lost some of its luster as junk bonds became associated in the public's mind with hostile takeovers. Heavy debts from buyouts and mergers sapped momentum from the takeover rush and prompted questions about the wisdom of financing through leverage. While some takeovers promoted efficiency by forcing managers to lop off unproductive enterprises, they also forced undue emphasis on short-term profitability to pay off debt, in direct contrast to the forward-thinking Japanese. Corporations erected sophisticated defenses to ward off takeover threats and some states even passed laws to keep out raiders. The crash-rattled financial markets, meanwhile, imposed `` circuit breakers'' to forestall another collapse. The technology revolution came through mostly unscathed. Powerful personal computers seemed to be on every desk. Biotechnology gave new life to medicine and fiber optics turned the phone network into an eight-lane voice and data expressway. If the technological advances had a dark side, it was the fear that too many people were left behind by an economy based on knowledge and skill. Laborers and clerks were replaced by machinery or silicon chips. An unskilled, despairing underclass grew increasingly detached from the rest of society. The revolutions and reactions of the Money Decade echoed a historic American theme: the contest between liberty and equality. More liberty generally means less equality; less liberty means more equality. The contest, far from resolved here at home, now engages a world of players as the'90s approach. Out of desperation, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are giving once-hated capitalism a chance in spite of the risk of upheaval. A new Soviet opinion poll shows widespread resentment of the newly rich and craving for a return to `` a strong hand'' over the economy. For those who will struggle with the choices of free enterprise in the future, the'80s left clear warnings. More growth can equal less security. With freedom comes the responsibility to manage greedy extremes. Americans lived that dilemma in the 1980s. Now the rest of the world is taking its turn.

 Americans overwhelmingly believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has fumbled away its economic supremacy to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the 1980s, yet few expect their personal finances to suffer in the coming decade, a national survey has found. Nearly seven in 10 respondents in the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll said they believe <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is the leading economic power in the world today. Just 26 percent said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> leads. At the same time, however, fewer than two in 10 respondents said their family's finances had worsened in the past 10 years. And fewer still, just 13 percent, expected their finances to deteriorate in the decade ahead. The youngest respondents, aged 18 to 29, were the most optimistic about their financial future. And they were the least apt to believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' economic position has slipped in the past decade. But their elders were solidly convinced of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' slide Six in 10 said the country's economic leadership weakened in the 1980s, while just 14 percent believed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew stronger. Despite that perception, there was only minority support for a greater federal role in industrial development. Fifty-one percent preferred to have market forces direct industry's fortunes, while 37 percent said they favored government help in financing selected industries. The rest were unsure. Opinion was divided on some factors in the nation's economic performance in the 1980s. Respondents split evenly on whether government deregulation had been good or bad for the economy, and they also split on whether the stock market had been a help or hindrance. But there was general agreement on other issues: Nearly seven in 10 said competition from foreign imports had hurt the economy in the past decade, and about six in 10 said foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had hurt. Even more, nearly eight in 10, said the federal deficit had damaged the economy. About half said corporate mergers had hurt, with others split on whether mergers helped or made no difference. Of all the factors posed, only one was widely seen as a benefit: The increasing number of women in the work force was said by 77 percent to have helped the economy in the 1980s. Men and women shared that view equally. On many issues, opinion split along political lines. Republicans were a bit more sanguine about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic leadership; 48 percent of them said it had weakened, vs. 61 percent of Democrats and independents. Similarly, 31 percent of the Republicans polled picked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the world's leading economy today, while just 23 percent of the others agreed. And 40 percent of Republicans and independents said deregulation had been good for the economy, vs. 28 percent of the Democrats. More Republicans may hold positive views of the economy because more were doing better. Sixty-five percent said their family's financial situation had improved in the 1980s; that fell to 46 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of the independents The poll was a telephone survey, so the 7 percent of the population without phones _ generally the poorest <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> _ could not be included.

<HEAD>Of Yuppies and Soft Landings: The Buzzwords of the '80s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business News</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Yuppies and couch potatoes. Bailouts and bundlings. Soft landings and hard The 1980s were the salad days for bizspeak, buzzwords and lousy metaphors. Business people tried to stay ahead of the curve by shooting from the lip with just the right jargon to show they were players, not bean counters. To say it in the'80s, you had to coin it _ or so it seemed from the flood of new and retreaded idioms unleashed during the Money Decade. Below are some of the serious and not-so-serious entries from the decade's business lexicon: ARBITRAGE: Wall Street's high-stakes game of `` buying low and selling high'' simultaneously. A variation of the strategy was used by the decade's most notorious `` arb,'' <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, to speculate in takeover stocks. The word at first sent business writers scurrying for dictionaries, but by decade's end arbitrage was synonymous with wheeling and dealing. BAILOUT: A government rescue. Corporations averted a crash landing by parachuting into Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s warm embrace, among them <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and many savings and loans. BEAN COUNTER: Pejoratively, a back-office type, often from accounting, disparaged for watching the bottom line. Some say they gained inordinate power in the'80s. BUNDLING: Packaging debt _ from leveraged buyouts to mortgages _ in nice tidy bundles for sale to investors. CORRECTION: An optimist's view of a sharp drop in market prices. It supposedly prepares the way for a resumed rise. COUCH POTATO: Aging yuppie now living in the suburbs; financially satiated though highly mortgaged; eats in a lot and watches the VCR. DEINDUSTRIALIZATION: Bemoans the decline of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing. It became less popular in the decade's final years when Americans realized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was still making cars, refrigerators, even television sets. EURO: A much-used prefix for anything vaguely European as 1992 approaches. Sample: `` Euro-pessimism -LRB- or Euro-sclerosis -RRB- is becoming Euro-phoria as 12 Western European countries prepare to unite in one trading community.'' GLOBALIZATION: The new world where corporate power transcends national boundaries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not the only economic superpower. GOLDEN: As in parachute, umbrella or handcuffs. It describes a lucrative goodbye handed to corporate executives. GREATER FOOL THEORY: An explanation for why stocks rise. Investors overpay on the assumption they will be able to unload on someone else at an even dearer price. GREENMAIL: Refers to the color of the payoff raiders get for quitting the hunt. It is more than average shareholders can get, thus the echo of blackmail. INSIDER TRADER: <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is alleged to have been one, along with dozens of others caught up in the government's crackdown on securities fraud in the'80s. They are so described for trading stock on the basis of secret information that gives them an unfair advantage. JAPANESE: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s chief economic rival; synonymous with quality, efficiency, reliability; also, fear, loathing and power. JOINT VENTURE: What many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses resorted to when the going got rough against foreign competitors. If you could n't beat'em, you joined'em in the'80s. JUNK BONDS: Securities pulled from the scrap heap of corporate finance by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, among others. These high-risk, high-yield debt securities helped fuel the stock market boom and merger mania. LBO: One of the best-known acronyms of the age, short for `` leveraged buyout,'' where companies are bought with mostly borrowed money. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was the biggest ever at $ 25 billion. PLAYER: The opposite of bean counter. It stands for the pin-striped, suspendered gamblers who pull off the big deals. POISON PILL: What a company might swallow to avert a takeover. In extreme cases, it can force the company to take on debilitating debt. PRIVATIZATION: The sale of nationally owned companies to investors, as with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s phone company and several British industries. REAGANOMICS: A potpourri of policies by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration to reduce taxes, increase defense spending and decrease social spending. The latter caused the term to become a rallying cry of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> critics. RESTRUCTURING, DOWNSIZING: Euphemisms for cost-cutting, laying off workers and attaining more profits with fewer employees. SHARK: Any of a variety of predators notorious for their voracious appetite for takeovers and unfriendly assaults on innocent companies. Also known as `` corporate raider'' or euphemistically as `` financier.'' SOFT LANDING, HARD LANDING: Terms launched by economists to describe ways the economy can slow down. SUPPLY SIDE: Theory sketched out by economics professor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> and adopted by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, holding that cutting taxes will stimulate the economy and increase productivity without fueling inflation. TAKEOVER: What you do n't want to happen to your company, but probably will. TWIN DEFICITS: The federal budget deficit and the trade imbalance. Also known as the `` twin towers'' in reference to their hugeness. YUPPIE: Acronym for young urban professional. It describes any ambitious, affluent, self-obsessed, well-educated free spender. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has Juppies and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Guppies. It also spawned offshoots like `` sitcom,'' for single income outrageous mortgages, and `` dink,'' for dual income no kids.

<HEAD>Deregulation Deemed a Success, But Trouble Spots Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It has produced cut-rate airline tickets, higher interest rates for savers and lower long-distance costs _ but the deregulation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> enterprise carries a price tag, too. For openers, there's the $ 50 billion now, plus perhaps $ 100 billion later, to bail out the savings and loan industry, in trouble before deregulation and in worsening straits afterward. With the bailout came, belatedly, a stringent system of regulation to oversee every facet of the industry. The low-cost air service that is said to be saving travelers and shippers more than $ 14 billion a year does n't reach everywhere; fares into smaller, non-competitive cities are as steep or steeper than before. Deregulation in telecommunications is still contentious, in the courts and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Long-distance costs less, some local services more. There are a dozen bills seeking some measure of re-regulation of cable television. In other deregulated industries, some prices are higher, some services lacking, and surveys indicate that wages are generally lower than would be the case had regulation remained. Overall, though, the consensus among economic analysts is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is better off with deregulation than without it. Among economists, that judgment spans the political spectrum, conservative to liberal. There's less unanimity among politicians, some of whom pick targets and threaten regulatory moves to get at them. There's been congressional talk, for example, of regulation to make sure that television viewers do n't someday have to pay to see the pro football Super Bowl. Deregulation has been a selective process. New Deal-era regulation of industry and transportation has been phased out, while regulation involving the environment, health and safety has been increasing. While there may be a backlash on some issues, nobody expects a reversal of the trend toward deregulation. `` Unless you repeal technology, I do n't think you'll ever be able to go back to the old, regulated system,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattuso </PERSON>, regulatory affairs analyst at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. A bill making its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have the government intervene against airline takeovers on safety or competitive grounds, a measure opposed by the administration as creeping re-regulation. A more drastic measure proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, with two Republican co-sponsors, would have the government reinstate regulation of fares, routes and service. While that is not likely to pass, it reflects discontent with some of the fallout of deregulation. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to do a little tinkering, to show that they're doing something,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> specialist on deregulation in the transportation industry. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was president during much of the deregulation decade, and his administration boasted of easing or undoing shackles on business. But little was accomplished after his first term. Major regulatory overhauls of the past decade were shaped before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, some by Democrats. Indeed, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., was an early advocate of airline deregulation, which began while <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was president Economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Niskanen </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic adviser, flunked the last Republican administration on regulatory relief and reform. `` Although this program started with a bang, it ended with a whimper,'' he wrote. Near the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, `` attempts to rein in the regulatory establishment virtually ceased,'' according to a study by <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilton </PERSON> at the Center for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chilton </PERSON> found that regulatory agencies grew during his administration, with two notable exceptions. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which used to regulate airline routes and fares, was shut down, and the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> cut its spending by nearly two-thirds. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> grew the most, with spending up 70 percent during the two <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> terms. The government spends more than four times as much on social regulation to protect health, safety and the environment as it spends on economic regulation. Among the landmarks of deregulation in the 1980s: _ AIRLINES Route and rate decontrol began in 1978. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was shut down in 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regulates the airlines on safety matters. Estimates of the economic benefits of an expanding airline industry range up to about $ 15 billion a year. Fares are about 29 percent lower than they would have been without deregulation, according to a Brookings analysis. But there also have been bankruptcies and more than a dozen major takeovers, prompting the proposals for revived regulation. And the growth in air travel also has led to airport congestion and delays. _ BROADCASTING Most programming requirements and limits on commercials were dropped by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>; first for radio, then, in 1984, for television. Station license renewals were simplified as programming checks were dropped. A lottery system supplanted fitness exams as the basis for choosing among competitors for new licenses in such fields as cellular telephone service, low-power and pay television systems. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> FCC dropped the fairness doctrine, which had required balance in broadcast coverage of controversial issues. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is trying to reinstate it. The deregulation trend dates from the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, when the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> eased cable television restrictions and began the process for broadcasters. _ TELEPHONE SERVICE The breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> completed what had begun nearly 20 years before when Democrat <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was president. The 1982 settlement, effective in 1984, split telephone operating companies away from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and set rules fostering competition in long-distance service. That eased regulation but did n't undo it on long-distance rates, which still are subject to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> and state regulators. _ BANKING The thrifts were already in trouble before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to ease regulation of the investments they could make and the amount of interest they could offer depositors. Shaky savings and loans could, and did, make high-risk investments to try to pull even. Speculators had an easy time attracting money because the government insured deposits. The danger of default was not so clear in the early 1980s. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration unsuccessfully sought broader deregulation, on the theory that banks and savings and loans could then compete more effectively in a changing financial world. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confronted a worsening S & amp; L crisis when he took office, and answered with the bailout bill he signed last summer. _ TRUCKING, RAILROAD FREIGHT They were partly deregulated under legislation passed in 1980, before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Surveys point to lower shipping costs. Winston, at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, is about to publish a study that will indicate savings and benefits in surface transportation of more than $ 14 billion. One analyst, reviewing the decade in 1988, said economic deregulation reduced prices and costs in every industry in which it was tried. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist, said the benefit did n't show everywhere because in some places, especially rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, regulators had set prices below costs, and offset them by charging more elsewhere. <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> said deregulation increased employment in the industries involved, but at generally lower wages, savings that represent a substantial share of the reduction in prices and costs. For all of that, as he noted in a study published by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the regulatory structure that was in place 20 years ago is almost intact. No major overhaul is in prospect. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is committed to deregulation; as vice president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed a task force on regulatory reform. But regulatory change is not high on the administration's priority list.

<HEAD>After Decade of Deregulation, Airlines Facing Challenges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's largest airline company is a conglomeration of big and small carriers flying under the regional banner of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Almost every other major carrier has been a target for takeover or restructuring. Airports are clogged, fares are inscrutable, and the commercial fleet is showing its age with frightening regularity. That is probably not the future the architects of deregulation imagined in 1978 when the airline industry was freed from government control over fares and routes. But that future is now, after little more than a decade of freewheeling competition. For business students of the 1980s, there was no more compelling case study of the impact of Reagan-era deregulation. No industry underwent more wrenching changes. None moved from controls to competition to consolidation as quickly. In October 1988, the airlines celebrated their first decade of freedom. Less than a year later, the industry was engulfed by a wave of takeover fever, its second since deregulation began. `` I'm uneasy about the wave of buyouts,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> who is widely considered the father of airline deregulation. `` The critical thing is, how does it affect competition?'' In the space of a week last August, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest carrier, was put into play by a $ 5.4 billion buyout bid for parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from oilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>; an investor group completed its $ 3.65 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>; frequently rumored takeover target <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> completed its merger with <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> and separately sold a major stake to `` white knight'' investor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>; and a manufacturing company said it might consider a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. While the fierce competition sparked by deregulation turned many airlines into hot properties, it put others in desperate straits. In 1989, three carriers filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11: <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, hit by a crippling strike in early March; <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for the second time in seven years; and <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a feeder carrier for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. As some companies faltered, the takeover frenzy continued to build, culminating in developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 7.5 billion buyout proposal in October for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of industry leader <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> failed to assemble financing for its $ 6.75 billion pilot-management buyout _ an announcement that caused a sudden 190-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 13 _ the mania subsided temporarily. But <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> talks revived, and experts said the reshaping of the industry will continue in the'90s. Airlines in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are positioning themselves to exploit the Common Market deregulation set to begin in 1992, and some are swooping down to buy pieces of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. The prospect of foreign ownership and the heavy debts associated with takeovers have prompted warnings from officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, foreign airlines are n't allowed to own more than 25 percent of the voting stock of domestic carriers. In October, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> used his authority to force <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the foreign partner in the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> deal, to cut its $ 400 million investment by $ 225 million. For travelers, the fallout from deregulation has been even more worrisome. The number of passengers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines jumped to around 455 million in 1988 from 275 million in 1978, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. By the year 2000, traffic is projected to be 800 million or 900 million people. There's nowhere near enough capacity in the system _ runways, airport space and air traffic control _ to handle the onslaught. The nation's commercial fleet, meanwhile, has been aging rapidly, from an average 8.5 years old in 1978 to 12.5 a decade later. Aging aircraft have been blamed for some terrifying accidents in recent years and have compelled thriving big airlines to buy new jets. To upgrade their fleets, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers spent a record $ 67 billion in the first 11 months of 1989 on 1,600 new planes. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest commercial aircraft maker, can not keep pace. Its backlog, swollen further by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike that ended Nov. 20, is now worth $ 85 billion. The problems, and the concern about safety they have prompted, have intensified pressure on the federal government to re-regulate the industry, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> and others warn. Proposals to re-regulate the airlines emerged in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in early November. The industry hopes it will be allowed to work out the problems. As for the lack of capacity, `` There's a lot of immediate things that can be done,'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said in an interview. Bakes, a former attorney for the CAB, was influential in drawing up the 1978 deregulation law. As a sign of progress, he pointed to the first meeting in mid-October of the <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capacity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> _ a group that includes representatives of the major airlines, airport operators and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s department is developing a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transportation policy to take the country into the 21st century, and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capacity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> will help expedite the rebuilding of the infrastructure. If those efforts fail, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> warned, `` We will lose the benefits of deregulation.''

<HEAD>Airline Deregulation: Pros and Cons</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Decade-Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since the nation's airline industry was deregulated in October 1978, a debate has raged on the benefits and problems created by the move. Among the main benefits, according to supporters and industry experts: _ A `` democratization'' of air travel, formerly the domain of relatively few Americans The number of passengers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines jumped to around 455 million last year from 275 million in 1978. By the year 2000, that traffic is widely projected to surge to 800 million or 900 million people. _ With nine out of 10 air travelers flying on some sort of discount fare, the average price of a plane ticket dropped 21 percent from 1978 to 1988 with inflation taken into account, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ A planeload of passengers takes off from an airport somewhere in the country on an average of every 4.8 seconds _ Several studies of airline deregulation contend that travelers and the economy as a whole have benefited The downside: _ Growing complaints about the concentration of the industry around a few `` mega-carriers'' and about the dominance they wield in and out of some cities, and through links with commuter airlines to entire regions of the country _ Unprecedented congestion at busy airports and in the skies surrounding them, with some airport planners resorting to high landing fees to keep out smaller aircraft _ Concerns about aviation safety Critics both in and out of the industry complain that the government is unable to keep up with traffic growth and industry fluctuations to assure a continuing high level of safety. _ Predictions of catastrophe and re-regulation of the industry unless airports are expanded, new airports are built and the air traffic control system is modernized _ Complaints that airline service continues to deteriorate, especially in rural areas, while prices are allowed to soar unfairly high in some markets, especially between busy `` hub'' airports dominated by one or two airlines _ A realization that the days of aviation entrepreneurs starting an airline from scratch and taking on the competition have long passed, the victim of the same `` mega-carriers.

 Most Americans probably do n't remember it, but a war broke out on Aug. 25, 1982. It was a confrontation involving four huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations that ended with <ORGANIZATION> Bendix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, initially the aggressor, getting swallowed up and disappearing under the wing of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It may seem remote and insignificant now. But this fight from the early 1980s helped shape a decade of wild and expensive takeover battles that peaked in 1988 with the $ 25 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and stumbled just two months ago with the collapse of a planned $ 6.75 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Throughout the decade, takeovers had a constant companion: controversy. Businessmen, economists and lawmakers debated whether takeovers were good or bad for companies, employees and the country. The Bendix war introduced the concept of the hostile takeover bid to many Americans. Led by high-profile chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON> fired the first shot that August with an unwanted bid for <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> fought back, trying to gobble up <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON> in what became known as the `` Pac-Man'' defense, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also entered the fray By the time the battle ended in January 1983, <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON> had self-destructed and become part of Allied in a $ 2 billion buyout and both <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> and Allied were deeply in debt. Then, in 1985, just a little over two years after acquiring <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON>, Allied merged with <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 4.9 billion deal As the decade progressed, buyouts got bigger and bigger. In 1988, they reached their zenith with the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Also during the year, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 12.9 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> acquiredPillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.68 Even as the stakes were raised, one deal was launched that would begin to push the pendulum of merger mania back the other way. The $ 6.6 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in April 1988, helped send takeovers to their nadir 18 months later. Junk bonds, the breakfast of all takeover champions, proved too hard for investors to swallow in the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> deal. Thehigh-risk, high-yield bonds had made it possible for `` just about anybody on the block'' to get some action going, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hass </PERSON>, a professor of managerial economics and finance at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. But some big dealmakers _ <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> chief among them _ took on more debt than they could handle and could not make their interest payments. After <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles became known, the junk-bond market plunged and suddenly, it seemed next to impossible to find money for a deal. No one learned that lesson harder than <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> this fall. Pilots and senior managers of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> could n't get enough banks to finance their planned buyout of the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the deal collapsed on Oct. 13, dragging the stock market down with it. News of the failed buyout sent the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting 190 points. Takeovers were a factor in some of Wall Street's best and worst performances during the 1980s. Speculation about buyouts helped propel the market to record highs but the possibility that the takeover boom was ending contributed to the Oct. 19, 1987 crash and the market's most recent slide. Amid the turmoil, the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal continued to shine, even though the record buyout was accomplished with $ 4 billion of junk bonds. Cash from the company's food and tobacco business was expected to easily service its massive debt load. But even with such bright spots as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, all the takeover battles, soaring debt levels and market gyrations unsettled many Americans. Workers whose companies were taken over found themselves facing layoffs as new owners cut costs. Local officials worried about the effect takeovers would have on their communities. Congressmen warned that companies saddled with massive interest payments could fail, jeopardizing the solvency of banks that helped finance the deals. Other critics, citing the profits many investors made from takeovers, said there was just too much greed. But supporters of the takeover process _ including the bidders themselves _ said buyouts improved the efficiency of companies because unnecessary jobs and expenses were eliminated. That made the firms more profitable and able to expand, and that was good for the economy, they said. <PERSON> Hass </PERSON> noted that `` companies that were potential targets have cleaned up their act'' by restructuring and paring costs. Takeovers indirectly helped those firms, he said. The negative atmosphere surrounding takeovers spawned new state laws seeking to shield companies, their employees and communities from becoming the pawns of takeover strategists. Suitors tried to dismantle the statutes, but in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled the states had the right to pass laws curbing hostile takeovers. The new statutes gave companies more muscle to fight unwanted bids. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where more than half the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated, a new law allowed <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to use an employee stock ownership plan and other devices to defeat a hostile bid by <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. State courts also became deeply involved in shaping takeover law and helped determine the outcome of several major fights <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts stopped <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, allowing <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with a $ 14 billion merger. Legal obstacles helped persuade strategists including <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> to give up hostile takeovers. They said the process had become too complicated and too expensive, and they turned their attention toward overseas targets _ <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. For dealmakers of the future, caution may be in greater supply than junk bonds. Said <PERSON> Hass </PERSON>, `` Only mergers or acquisitions that make economic sense are going to prevail.''

 Ten years ago, its holdings included 600,000 acres of timberland, 425 music stores, 50,000 employees and $ 1.6 billion in machinery used to make Dixie cups, paper towels and the packages used to hold toothpaste, beer and frozen foods. Today, it has 484 loan offices, 270,000 credit card accounts, 190,000 life insurance agents and 35,000 representatives registered to sell mutual funds. If any one company exemplifies what happened to business in the 1980s, it may be <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which in the decade transformed itself from manufacturing to financial services. While some differ on the wisdom of the trend, economists agree the 1980s were a time when the economy's shift from manufacturing to services accelerated. From 1979 to 1987, the number of jobs in manufacturing dropped from 21 million to 19 million, while jobs in the service sector grew from 63 million to 77 million, according to statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Manufacturing's share of the gross national product fell from 22.5 percent in 1979 to 20.8 percent in 1985, according to a 1989 study by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON>, research director at the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. American Can was formed at the turn of the century from 123 small canning firms and can manufacturers. Business prospered through the 1950s, as a growing number of manufacturers sought packaging for everything from tomato paste to tennis balls. When growth began to slow in the 1950s, American Can diversified by moving into paper products, printing and various recycling businesses. In the 1970s, it moved into retailing, buying outfits like <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> record stores and the Fingerhut mail-order house. The big move into financial services came in the 1980s. It began in 1982 when American Can bought <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a life insurance holding company, for $ 127 million Associated's chairman, financial whiz <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, came on board to engineer the transformation into financial services, an industry he saw as fragmented and leaning toward deregulation American Can spent the next several years buying more than $ 1 billion worth of insurance and other financial businesses and selling off paper and packaging operations and all its retail interests except for Fingerhut. As the American economy boomed in the mid-1980s, so did the transformed American Can. In 1987, for the third straight year, the company's insurance lines sold more life insurance than any other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group. Revenues from financial services grew. Net income almost doubled from 1983 to 1986. By then, financial services accounted for more than 70 percent of the company's profits. American Can changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> on April 28, 1987. One month later, it added frosting to the cake, spending $ 750 million to buy <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, the esteemed old Wall Street firm. The move seemed smart until five months later, when the stock market crashed. As Wall Street stumbled, so did <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>, whose net income dropped. <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> had pretax losses of $ 93 million in 1987 and $ 53 million in 1988. `` I remember thinking this was not going to be very good for the old <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> because they just bought <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, now <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman. `` It turned out to happen at a wrong time. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> did n't do well for a year and a half.'' But, like the market, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> was far from sunk. In December 1988, it was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, as chairman of Commercial Credit, took over from <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and is presiding in new <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> headquarters as the company tries to become a force in financial services Just this year, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> announced that its Commercial Credit was buying the branch offices and loan portfolio of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American-Financial </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.35 billion. The purchase is expected to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>'s position as one of the country's major consumer and home-equity lenders Not all is perfect in <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s future. One of the same question marks that faces the American economy entering the 1990s also faces the company: the financial markets' continuing volatility, seen in the 190-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 13. `` That kind of volatility, when it comes so fast with no notice, people say, ` Is this really a safe place to put our money?''' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said. `` I think we have a real job to do to get the individual to believe in investing in equities again in this country.'' But <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> remains optimistic that financial services is a good place to be in the 1990s. If troubles affect <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> can still count on earnings from its commercial credit and life insurance businesses, he said.

 In 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was a Canadian developer virtually unknown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Then it went on a spending spree fed by junk bonds and ended up owning many major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> department store chains. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> ca n't pay debts and has been forced to put its prized <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s on the block. Ten years ago, the federal deficit stood at $ 663.6 billion, and many thought it a disgrace the nation was living beyond its means. Then the deficit ballooned out of control during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, quadrupling to $ 2.8 trillion today. About 200,000 Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 1979. By last year the figure topped 540,000 after a credit-card binge that led one bank to issue plastic to children. The 1980s was the decade of debt. Junk bonds, gold cards, leveraged buyouts, deficit spending _ all became standards of the age as companies, consumers and the government loaded up with borrowed money as never before. `` This certainly will be the decade that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> exploded in debt,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, chief economist for the economic consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Leverage is a word that may be forever linked with the 1980s,'' added <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON>, senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Corporate debt nearly tripled, from $ 774 billion at the start of 1980 to more than $ 2 trillion as the decade closed Much of that is due to a takeover and buyout frenzy that reshaped corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and left many industrial titans teetering atop mountains of IOUs. High-risk, high-yield securities, labeled `` junk'' bonds, ushered in the dominance of debt as a way for corporations to raise cash, pushing the old standby of stock offerings into the background. Junk bonds made possible such megadeals as the record $ 25 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. They also led to the downfall of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its chief junk-bond trader, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Debt in the 1980s also became a way for corporations to avoid the clutches of takeover artists. By loading themselves up with debt obligations through selling bonds, companies made themselves less appealing targets and made their shareholders happy with special dividends. While <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and other dealmakers praised the power of debt to squeeze efficiency out of bloated old-line corporations, the debt binge inspired doomsday scenarios in the minds of others. Some economists predict that corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be deeply scarred by a recession. A wave of bankruptcies, plant closings and layoffs could be the price of the all the borrowing, they warn, when leaner economic times make it difficult to pay bondholders. But others, such as <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, are less pessimistic, and say only the most highly leveraged companies would collapse. Many economists say the broader question about the nation's debt binge is whether the borrowed money was wisely spent. When it was used to improve plants and machinery, to introduce new products and to build bridges, schools and highways, it was a good investment. But when it was used by corporate financiers to `` churn'' money by taking companies private, selling parts of them and then going public again, there was little or no benefit to the economy, these economists argue. <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said he is particularly troubled by the federal deficit, which he calls `` a disease that is going to weaken us for years.'' The federal debt `` is going to reduce our standard of living by about a quarter of a percent a year,'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said. `` We borrowed this money not to finance expansion but to finance consumption.'' Household debt mushroomed from $ 1.31 trillion at the start of the decade to about $ 3.27 trillion as of this June, according to <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. About two-thirds of that debt represents mortgages, while the rest is credit-card and other personal borrowing. While junk bonds and leveraged buyouts stole the spotlight, banks and financial houses learned new tricks with other forms of debt during the 1980s, such as repackaging loan and credit-card portfolios into bonds that were sold to the public. The decade also saw the explosive growth of mortgage-backed bonds from <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, three government-created entities that buy mortgages from savings and loans and repackage them as bonds. Wall Street firms earned huge profits dealing in these issues. As the'80s came to a close there were signs that the national borrowing binge was losing steam. Credit-card spending by consumers appeared to slow as it lost its tax-deductibility under the 1986 tax code revision. Federal deficit spending was reined in by the Gramm-Rudman law. The junk-bond market skidded as some of the LBOs of the 1980s became unglued. But the years of deficit spending will take many more years to be paid off _ if they ever are. Some say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already is paying for its live-for-today attitude, which has been blamed for a dearth of research and development investment and a decline in the nation's technological edge.

<HEAD>Buyouts, Shift from Industrial Pursuits Changed Face of Fortune 500</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> disappeared from industrial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known roster, sold in a management buyout. Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> became too small to qualify. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was reclassified and appears on a separate service company list. For a variety of reasons, upwards of one-third of the companies included at the end of the 1970s on the Fortune 500 ranking of the nation's biggest industrial concerns were missing from the same list a decade later. The buyout wave of the 1980s was a major factor in the sweeping changes in the Fortune 500 list. Combined sales rose 66 percent to more than $ 2 trillion. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, which was No. 177 on the list published in 1979, last appeared among the Fortune 500 in 1985 after which it was sold to management. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, which ranked a lofty 18th on the 1979 list, changed its name that year to <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION>, then vanished from the list after <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acquired it in 1981. The flip side of the buyout wave has been that buyers generally moved up the list. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> was ranked ninth in 1989, up from No. 16 a decade earlier. Making an even bigger move was <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the cigarette manufacturer ranked 10th in 1989 and 46th in 1979. It bought <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which was 41st in 1979, and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, which was 39th, during the 1980s. Some companies dropped off the list, meanwhile, because they sold assets or failed to grow fast enough. Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which sold assets over the decade, was No. 248 in 1979 and last appeared in 1987. Another big factor in the changes was an increasing emphasis on service businesses. Companies must derive at least 50 percent of their sales from manufacturing or mining to qualify for the magazine's industrial rankings; otherwise they are eligible for Fortune's Service 500. That caused companies like <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>, ranked 11th on the 1979 industrial list, to be moved to the list of diversified service companies in 1988. Other prominent companies reclassified as service concerns during the 1980s included <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, ranked 58th on the industrial list in 1979 and now known as <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and American Can, which was 66th in 1979 and is now called <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>. The top of the Fortune 500 industrial listing has been fairly stable despite the exodus of companies lower down. Eight of the Top 10 in 1979 were still there in 1989. The dropouts are <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, now known as <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. Standard Oil had been No. 6 in 1979 and Gulf Oil was ninth. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> ranks 11th on the 1989 list. They were replaced by the acquisitive <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> led the 1979 list with $ 63.2 billion in sales and remained at the top in 1989 with nearly twice as much _ $ 121.1 billion. The 500th company in 1979 moved halfway up the ladder, reflecting computer industry growth in the Money Decade. Data General was 500th in 1979 with sales of $ 379.9 million and No. 272 in 1989 with sales of $ 1.36 billion.

<TEXT>
 The longest peacetime expansion in history. The oft-repeated phrase rings hollow in the oil patch, where the optimism of the early'80s dissolved to depression following the OPEC-induced collapse of the energy markets. Ditto in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, which became known as the Rust Bowl. And on the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, where farmers suffered through drought and foreclosure. And perhaps in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where analysts now see recession. Not everybody has enjoyed 84 straight months of Good Times. `` Overall, when you look at the macro numbers, it looks pretty good, -LRB- but -RRB- there have been all sorts of people who have suffered,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> economist who identified the concept of a rolling recession, which strikes different spots at different times. `` Try going into a bar in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in 1984,'85 or'86 and telling the steelworkers we have n't had a recession, they'd toss you out on your ear,'' said <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>. `` If we can continue to have these rolling recessions _ knock some sense into all of us but one at a time instead of all at once,'' then the nation as a whole is better off, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> believes. Manufacturing had its recession in 1985, energy in 1986 and construction started its downturn at the end of last year, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, head of the Economic Forecasting Project at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` But none of them did it at the same time,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> is just now starting to get its head above water, while the darlings of the early'80s _ the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, are just beginning to slip -LRB- and -RRB- there are signs out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> that their housing market has overdone it.'' The rolling recession churns on. `` Many states that were winners since 1985 could turn out to be losers as the new decade begins,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> P.A. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. `` In some regions the reversal already has begun.'' The party may be over in the Northeast. `` It already is the problem area,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, managing economist for <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The Northeast has experienced the slowest growth among all regions. We're saying the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> is in a recession.'' Speculative overbuilding and weakness in the computer industry have led to the decline, she said. A report by financial industry consultant <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> recently warned of weakening banks in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> as the overbuilding begins to take a toll, just as it did in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. But whatever the Northeast's problems, they wo n't approach the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s of the last few years. When the 1980s opened, the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> was basking in expectations of $ 50-a-barrel oil while the rest of the country still was struggling. When Northeasterners complained about the high price of oil, Texans responded with bumper stickers saying, `` Let'em freeze in the dark.'' Credit was there for the asking; new office buildings sprouted like the state's prized wildflowers. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' the prime-time soap opera, flaunted the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> high life and became one of the most popular shows on television. Then the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began pumping more oil and prices fell to just over $ 10 a barrel, too low to be profitable in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oilfields. Bankruptcy became common. Unemployment exceeded 10 percent. Real estate agents took second jobs as hotel night clerks. The collapse soon dragged down the state's largest banks, forcing the federal government to come to the rescue. The more loosely regulated thrift industry, with problems exacerbated by fraud and shadowy dealing, became an embarrassment. The long-ignored concept of diversification became dominant, and the state began paying attention to education and industrial recruitment, `` because if we ca n't rely on God's gifts, we have to create our own gifts,'' said economist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fomby </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> successfully has turned to high technology, wooing two computer consortiums to the capital, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, now bills itself as the <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corridor </ORGANIZATION> based on the presence of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research center, plus the coming of large operations for <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>. While the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> is only now recovering, `` the Southeast has n't taken a recession in this decade,'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> State's <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said `` Parts of the Southeast stumbled a bit ... when manufacturing was stumbling, but there was enough strength in the cities with the movement towards the services that overcame all the mill towns shutting down.'' Although the Southeast has been in the lead, <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION>'s Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says it will `` slip into second behind the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>'' as employment and population gains slow and defense cutbacks are felt in several states. `` The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> regions have capitalized on the export boom and will continue to do so,'' she said. `` The economy is well-diversified with a nice mix of high tech, finance and services. Population continues to drift toward that region.'' The Midwest, meanwhile, may be starting a comeback, says <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>. `` One of the buzzwords of the 1980s was the Rust Bowl, the de-industrialization of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and this was focused on the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said. `` As it turned out, these forecasts of the death of American industry were unwarranted. It did restructure, did cut some excess capacity and by 1987 it was clear that we were coming out of the mid-cycle industrial recession very nicely.'' Meanwhile, the prospects for agriculture have improved, helped partly by the recent political changes in the Communist bloc. `` Look at all the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europeans </LOCATION> we're going to have to feed,'' <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said.

 Consumers bingedin the 1980s, indulging themselves with everything from fancy gourmet foods to electronic gadgets and luxury vacations. Now, on the cusp of a new decade, consumers bloated with debt are sobering up. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketplace bore the full weight of the postwar baby boom during the'80s. Many grown-up boomers ignored the example set by thrifty parents and spent liberally, helping to fuel the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history. They were helped in their pursuit of consumer happiness by some fortuitous economic events. Inflation was tamed in the early part of the decade by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tight money policies, and the prime lending rate, which had peaked at 21.5 percent in December 1980, fell closer to 10 percent by late 1982. A big income tax cut was engineered by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A bull market on Wall Street kicked up piles of money for lucky investors. A strong dollar made imported goods, like Japanese electronics and German automobiles, the standards by which all good, consuming Americans were measured. `` People went shopping like crazy. We were on a spending binge in the 1980s,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` For most of the decade Americans were spared the pair of miseries that plagued the 1970s and early'80s: rampant food and fuel inflation.'' Advertising jingles proclaiming `` You deserve a break today'' or asking cheekily `` Who says you ca n't have it all?'' summarized the spendthrift mentality of yuppies, the buzzword for young, urban professionals. `` They were not into postponed gratification,'' said Florida-based consultant <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>. Yuppies embodied'80s - style conspicuous Although representing less than an estimated 5 percent of the 76 million Americans born between 1946 and'64, they were the vanguard of the baby-boom generation, setting trends in consumer behavior. More consumers than ever before were armed with credit cards and carried the buy-now, pay-later concept to the limit. Over 606 million charge cards of all kinds, including ones offered by retailers, were held by Americans at the end of 1988, up from 380 million in 1979, according to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Bankcard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, whose Chicago-based market research firm tracks trends, said shopping habits changed drastically during the decade. Dual-income families had no room for `` chief shoppers,'' whose main mission in life is keeping cupboards from going bare and keeping house. The result was more individuals shopping for themselves, giving rise to specialty retailers, each supplying specific types of merchandise. These niche merchants are expected to thrive in the'90s, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. Trend spotter Faith Popcorn of the marketing consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Brain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said consumers seemed obsessed with props during the'80s, things that made them look good or helped project a certain image. The principal consequence of all this spending was an accumulation of debt and an accompanying decline in savings. The savings rate, measured as a percentage of spendable personal income, sank to some unusually low depths in the'80s: 3.2 percent in 1987, compared with an average between 6.5 percent and 7 percent in the three prior decades. The economy in general looks a lot different than it did when the boom began. The tax cut left behind a big budget deficit. The flood of imports threw the trade balance out of whack. Inflation, spurred along by aggressive spending, poses a new threat. Against the backdrop of impending hard times, consumer tastes are beginning to change, shifting away from extravagance toward practicality, the experts believe. Furniture, not fast cars, and home computers, not glitzy trinkets, will be the people's choice of the'90s. With a larger share of baby-boomers coping with the responsibility and expense of child rearing, purchases will be more sensible, predicts Ms. Popcorn, the marketing consultant. `` The 1980s were for show and the 1990s are for go, in terms of where is it going to get me in the future,'' Ms. Popcorn said. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> thinks of it as a shift away from abundance toward the `` precious,'' which he describes as an intense enjoyment of the things you have rather than simple gluttony. Even if belts are tightened a few notches, consumers will remain a driving force of economic activity. But their power may be channeled in different directions or diminished as the economy matures and sorts out imbalances, particularly in foreign trade. `` In the 1980s we were consuming more than we produced at home,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said. `` Final demand in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was greater than domestic production. To close the gap, we have to do the reverse.''

<HEAD>Firmly Rooted U.S. Automakers Bent Far Eastward in '80s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Tracker is one of those vehicles that could have existed only in the 1980s: designed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, built in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by a U.S.-Japanese partnership and sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Did that make it Japanese, Canadian, or maybe American, since it was sold in Chevrolet showrooms? Its producers avoided the issue by calling it a Geo, from the Greek word for Earth. For the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto industry, it was a confusing, sometimes difficult and above all blurry decade. Blurriest were the definitions of what was an imported car. Scenes of angry men battering a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> with sledgehammers faded into scenes of happy Japanese and American autoworkers toiling together on assembly plant teams. People were n't even sure what it was the companies were making. The Nissan Pathfinder was classified as a car by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a truck by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. As for attitudes toward the Japanese, just ask <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Most of the prejudices have gone away,'' he said, `` but I still have some relatives where they have n't.'' The auto industry was touched, like many others, by acquisitions, joint ventures and takeovers. As in other industries, the Japanese influence shifted into high gear. Proud American automakers, industrial pillars of the West, struggled to halt their loss of market share to competitors from across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> by forming joint ventures with Japanese companies and imitating <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s manufacturing and labor management. The Tracker typifies the partnership trend. The small sport-utility vehicle was designed by <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> It's built in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> at a factory owned by <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It's sold through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Chevrolet dealers and carries the Geo nameplate. For another example, a <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, produces cars for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The Japanese certainly have provided a goad and it has been a chance for us to learn some very good things that we have learned to apply,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Each of the Big Three battled back to profitability during the decade through new products, cost-cutting, union concessions and government protection from imports. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s case was the most widely publicized. In 1980, the federal government guaranteed loans to refloat the sinking automaker. The corporation paid off the loans seven years early. `` We began the decade of the'80s by taking one risk that ran against some of the most deeply ingrained economic ideals we hold in this country and it was a huge success,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said in a recent speech. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 1.54 billion in 1980 but it turned into the most profitable automaker in history just eight years later when it reported a $ 5.3 billion profit. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> began an `` Action Plan'' that has a target of trimming $ 13 billion from its costs. Instead of reinvesting all their profits, the Big Three hedged their bets by going into other businesses. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in October 1984 and <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in June 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> got into the banking business in December 1985 when it acquired San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which has become the nation's second-largest savings and loan institution. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> in August 1985, two years before it purchased <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, for one, later decided it was spreading itself too thin Late in 1989, it announced plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> and its military electronics business to `` concentrate resources on core car and truck operations.'' Another ploy of the automakers had an unintended side effect. The Big Three managed to obtain `` voluntary'' restraints on Japanese imports, but that only drove the Japanese into building plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Those plants made cars even more cheaply than the ones in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. spearheaded the Japanese manufacturing assault on American soil when it began making Civics in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, in November 1982 Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> have set up assembly plants either independently or in a joint venture with one of the Big Three automakers. Those plants are adding to big problems for the industry as the 1990s get under way _ overcapacity and the potential for layoffs. The overcapacity that emerged in the 1980s seems certain to worsen in the 1990s. The plants forced to close most likely wo n't be the new Japanese-owned ones in white-dominated, `` right-to-work'' places like rural <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> They'll be the aging Big Three plants, mostly located in union strongholds and employing a disproportionate share of minority workers Under pressure from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, membership in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union dropped during the decade from about 1.5 million to just under 1 million. While many things got blurry in the 1980s, the outlook for old-line autoworkers became starkly clear.

 The number of working <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil and gas rigs declined slightly this week, dropping by four to a total of 1,058. This week's decline follows a 25-rig increase that boosted the count last week to 1,062. That increase had reversed a two-week decline. The latest rig count, compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and reported Monday, is 136 ahead of a year ago. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the rig count since 1940. In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> gained seven rigs, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was up by three, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> each gained two and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s count increased by one. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> lost seven rigs, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was down by four, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> lost three and <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>'s count declined by two. The rig totals in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> were unchanged.

 For a lesson in how the investment picture changed in 1980s, ask the Hunt Brothers of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The former billionaires, who made a fortune in oil, tried to cash in on the meteoric rise of silver and other precious metals of the inflationary'70s and wound up losing their Rolex watches as the'80s rolled in and silver prices tumbled. `` There was a lot of pessimism around when <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was president and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was invading <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' noted <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` As the decade progressed I was much more optimistic.'' Political instability, heavy government regulation and high taxes and inflation, almost household words in the'70s, disappeared these past 10 years. The nation embarked on the longest peactime economic expansion ever. Financial assets, such as stocks, bonds or <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, flourished. So-called tangible, or `` real'' assets, including silver, gold, oil or farmland, gave up some of their gains of the previous decade, although noted exceptions were in some artwork and collectibles. A recent study by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> found that stocks averaged a 17 percent return during the'80s _ about twice the historical norm _ making them the No. 1 investment performers despite the 1987 stock market crash. Coins came in second with a 12.9 percent return; followed by bonds, 10.9 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, 10 percent. In the cellar were silver, with a 4.6 percent loss, and farmland, which lost 0.5 percent, the study said. Other poor performers were foreign exchange investments, which gained less than 1 percent due largely to the dollar's volatility; oil, which gained 1.2 percent; and gold, 2.8 percent. By comparison the inflation rate averaged 5.7 percent during the decade. Many experts believe stocks and bonds will continue to perform well in the early 1990s. But as <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> warns: `` Anytime you have such extraordinary returns in an asset in a 10-year period it's time to think of something else. Some experts see potential investment opportunities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly among Eastern-bloc countries, where rapid political and economic reforms are occurring. Others say regional real estate, which bottomed out in areas like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, is destined for a turnaround. Still, for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, who invests as a hobby, the bull stock market has been a boon for his <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>, which he helped start with friends five decades ago. `` From 1980 to now has been fabulous,'' he said. The club's portfolio, which includes a variety of stocks, grew threefold in the 1980s to a high of $ 2 million. By contrast, the club's porfolio rose by 41 percent in all of the previous decade. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a financial planner with <ORGANIZATION> Brownson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehmus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Foxworth </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said clients who came out on top in the'80s undoubtedly were enrolled in a company stock ownership plan. But diversification also was the key in dealing with financial assets, <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. Not all stock funds performed well. Those who took the conservative approach, sticking with typical passbook savings accounts or certificates of deposits, did n't do well when interest rates were low, generally in the mid-1980s. When stock prices crashed, however, the safety offered by fixed-income products was a blessing for many. `` Also, it made a difference how actively you traded your portfolio,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. `` Those who held onto the same portfolio with virtually no changes probably ended up with a greater return than those who made changes and had to pay brokerage fees and commissions and taxes.'' Investors were preoccupied with taxes during the'70s and early'80s, and investments designed to shelter more income from Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> were popular until tax laws were reformed late in the decade. `` A lot of the money in the early'80s went to tax-motivated ventures,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, who runs the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I remember driving down the coast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and seeing all these windmills. There used to be tax benefits for energy conservation.'' Perhaps one of the more notable changes in the'80s was that Americans became more Wall-Steet wise, partly because many families had more discretionary income to invest. `` Women began to really move in droves into the work force,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, a financial planner in the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, office of <ORGANIZATION> IDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` A lot of lower-income families were elevated to middle-class families.''

<TEXT>
 The Money Decade of the 1980s brought both heady success and egregious excess to Wall Street. The securities markets returned the favor by taking a hand in setting the economic and political course of the decade for American society. Stock traders celebrated the ascendance of deregulation, technology and global investing with a historic bull market that began in the summer of 1982 and reached new highs as late as the autumn of 1989. `` It has been a very unusual bull market _ the longest we have ever had in peacetime,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a veteran analyst at the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It outlasted several prominent participants, who by the end of the decade were serving prison terms or banished from the business for their parts in a series of scandals. In the ultimate test of its staying power, the bull market survived the worst market drop in more than half a century _ the crash of 1987 that culminated in Black Monday on Oct. 19 of that year. Wall Street in the'80s was unfailingly controversial as well. While the bull market signaled a seven-year period of economic expansion that was welcomed by many business managers and consumers, it was assailed by social critics as the emblem of an age of materialism. Many Wall Streeters themselves decried the new computerized trading techniques it helped spawn _ strategies like index arbitrage and portfolio insurance that collectively came under the label `` program trading.'' Worst of all, said some, the boom on Wall Street was financed in large part by a mountain of debt that might someday collapse with devastating consequences. Still, with all their blemishes, the 1980s lived up to their billing on the Street as `` the decade of financial assets.'' Gone were the bouts of rapid inflation and rapidly rising interest rates that depressed paper investments in the 1970s, elevating in their place tangible assets such as gold and collectibles. Stocks and bonds were back in favor as a way to participate in the growth and resilience of the American economy. As they recovered their strength, the stock and bond markets flexed their muscles, playing a newly prominent role in the shaping of government policies affecting the economy. At the beginning of the 1980s, it was the bond market's turn to play `` vigilante,'' acting as a kind of self-appointed surrogate for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> by increasing interest rates each time its traders sensed a new stirring of inflation. By the time of the 1987 crash, the stock market also had emerged as a vigilante force, impelling central bankers to ease up on credit conditions whenever it felt the threat of recession. The new breed of financial vigilante was quick to strike, sending the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials down a record 508 points on Black Monday in 1987, and administering another 190-point beating nearly two years later, on Oct. 13, 1989. Despite those rude interruptions, the net results for the decade showed emphatic advances. The Dow Jones industrials, which started the 1980s at 838.74, hovered near 2,700 in the waning weeks of the decade. That kind of performance wo n't be easy to match in the 1990s. For the average to triple again, it would have to climb past 8,000. Some observers see reason to hope for more good news. The nation's labor force is likely to grow more slowly in the 1990s, putting pressure on business to invest in greater amounts of productivity-enhancing equipment, says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, chief economist at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The net effect of increasing investment in business equipment will be a pattern of steady economic expansion through the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> asserts. Nevertheless, many analysts wonder whether more unpleasant shocks await a generation that grew up with the image of Wall Street as inexhaustible horn of plenty. As <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> put it: `` An awful lot of people are being seduced to the idea that we're never going to have another bear market again.''

<HEAD>Personal Computers Went Hand-in-Hand With Capitalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Diebold </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in the late 1950s talking about computers when a Russian stood up in the back of the room and said computers were exactly what his country needed. Large computers would finally enable Soviet leaders to control their economy according to plan, the Russian said. Do n't be so sure, <ORGANIZATION> Diebold </ORGANIZATION> told the man. Computers can do a lot, but they ca n't run an entire economy. Nothing can. Things are too complex. That meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> more than 30 years ago foreshadowed two of the most powerful developments of the 1980s: the rise of the personal computer and the decline of centrally planned economies. Western democracies prospered in the'80s because power was in the hands of the people. Personal computers helped by breaking the tyranny of the corporate data center, where men in white coats had doled out information to supplicants. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s commissars feared personal computers as much as printing presses. Their central computers were busy churning out five-year plans. It did n't work for producing steel, and it worked even less for producing ideas, the currency of the knowledge economy that emerged in the'80s. `` They always thought that if they just got one more level of sophistication in their equations, and in their models, that would make the whole thing work. It did n't,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Diebold </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based consultant. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recognized the personal computer's revolutionary potential in a January 1984 commercial of a female athlete throwing a mallet through an image of Big Brother In the flash of the exploding screen, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> announced the Macintosh and promised, `` You'll see why 1984 wo n't be like ` 1984.''' The personal computer was a phenomenon of the 1980s. While the pple II appeared in 1977, PCs did n't become a force in the business world until <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rolled out its first model in 1981. After that, things happened quickly. In 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> introduced 1-2-3, the electronic spreadsheet that gave many people a reason to buy their first computer. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> introduced its first <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> clone that year, and rose to the Fortune 500 faster than any company in history. 1984 was the year of the Macintosh as well as the first personal computers from newly split-up <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. In 1985, co-founder <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> resigned from Apple. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> tried to distance itself from the clone-makers with its Personal System-2 line. In 1989, Jobs introduced a black magnesium cube of a workstation that he called the `` Next.'' PCs were the great levelers in the'80s. They let little guys compete for business with big guys. Owners of PCs could dig facts out of databases, analyze them and assemble them into professional-looking documents _ all from a storefront office or a corner of the bedroom. The leveling happened within the computer industry itself. For <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, PCs threatened the fat profit margins it made on minicomputers and mainframes. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> found that all the resources of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> could not guarantee it success in the fast-moving PC industry. In 1989, it ran ads portraying itself as a <PERSON> David </PERSON> to the Goliath of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> _ a company not even founded a decade earlier. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> invented personal computers and used them in the'80s more than any other nation, perhaps a reflection of the go-it-alone spirit of Americans. Americans dominated production of PCs as well, but that may not last for long. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> gained control of most chips, screens and other components and attained a solid position in laptop computers, the fastest-growing portion of the market. Whether or not <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> takes over the PC industry in the'90s, the critical issue will be which company, and which nation, uses computers most intelligently. The wrong way is mindless number-crunching, which was all too common in the'80s. `` You got a lot of people showing very elegant sets of figures all worked out in great plans, but with the same sorts of lack of judgment you would have had without the computer,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Diebold </ORGANIZATION>. To change that, personal computers in the'90s must be machines for ideas, argues <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, an entrepreneur in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Society must learn to raise ideas as methodically as it raises wheat, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> argues He has sold <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and others on a program called IdeaFisher that prods people into making odd but fruitful mental associations. `` The computer's been crunching numbers and word-processing very neatly for a lot of years,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. `` Now we've got to move it into expanding our mind.'' That agenda is a natural for the American-born personal computer. It is definitely not what the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> had in mind.

<HEAD>Products of '80s Stressed Convenience, Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Product makers in the 1980s let people have what they wanted, even if it meant admitting a mistake. The revival of old <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> by popular demand told the story of the decade. Consumers were masters of the economic universe and they got exactly what they desired, from fax machines to oat bran. Convenience and specialization were hallmarks of'80s products. Microwave ovens had been available before the decade started, but their popularity zoomed in the'80s as lower prices and more compact construction helped make them indispensable fixtures in American kitchens. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, who heads her own New York-based market research firm, said the machine eased the guilt some homemakers felt about pursuing interests outside the home. The kids could easily fix their own hot meals. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> upset some customers by changing the formula for its flagship drink in 1985. The company said it listened to consumer complaints and brought back the original as Coca-Cola Classic three months later. The old standby soon regained status as the best-selling soft drink, leaving analysts to wonder whether it was all a publicity stunt. While the microwave oven made it easier to leave home, the 1980s offered other products for those who did n't necessarily want to go to the office. From the <ORGANIZATION> Timex </ORGANIZATION> Sinclair 1000 personal computer that debuted in the early part of the decade through generations of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and Apple models and the <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> laptop, people had the tools to keep up and figure things out for themselves at home. The trend toward self-sufficiency was accelerated with the proliferation of cellular telephones and personal facsimile machines. Well over half of American homes installed videocassette recorders, giving people the freedom to do what they wanted and still catch their favorite movies or programs on their terms. Forget to set the timer? You can tune in the portable <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watchman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> launched its national newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, in the 1980s and its colorful graphics and concise writing style influenced other papers In television, the mass media came under assault as cable networks emerged and others went after narrow audiences. Rock music fans got their <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> was launched. Home shopping channels also debuted, peddling jewelry, porcelain dolls and gadgets around the clock. Dozens of new financial products appeared in the 1980s, including zero-coupon bonds, securities backed by payments on car loans, bank money market accounts and futures trading based on stock indexes. On the highways, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> introduced minivans, cars like <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camaro </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Firebird livened up the dowdy state of auto design and convertibles made a comback. But the gull-winged DeLorean failed to fly -LRB- except in the movies -RRB-, and the <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> quickly ran out of gas. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Coolers started a rush to concocting alcoholic beverages for the adults who grew up on fizzy drinks, but the rage soon went flat. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> introduced LA, a low-alcohol beer that has lagged despite the trend toward moderation and health. The health craze created the environment for $ 100 sneakers from <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> and a revival of demand for oatmeal with its reputed cholesterol-lowering abilities. If the 1980s left you stressed, you could take some consolation from another product of the decade _ the pain reliever ibuprofen was approved for sale without prescription.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> and Jobs. Of the scores who played leading roles in business and finance during the decade, these are eight who shaped the'80s. When asked to name the great business leaders of the decade, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> business writers produced a list of more than 30, including some inanimate objects like the junk bond and one obvious group, the Japanese. But some individuals stood out, their contributions so familiar that the mere mention of their last names nearly tells their stories. These are eight who set the tone. Eight who personify the most important themes of the last 10 years _ free markets, corporate restructuring, economic transformation and global competitiveness. Two of the eight, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and ex-Federal <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, orchestrated events at the macroeconomic level, molding an economy of steady growth and low inflation. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> exploited the times, blazing trails and building fortunes in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unfettered marketplace. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> performed business miracles on opposite ends of the earth and emerged as national as well as corporate standard-bearers. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>, as a singular sensation, proved a reassuring reminder that no matter how much change the 1980s wrought, individual creativity was still the most valuable commodity for sale in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Below are brief reflections on the marks these eight left behind:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Reagan and Volcker: Two Most Powerful</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was dubbed the great communicator, but he was an even greater deregulator and free enterpriser, who dedicated his two-term presidency to restoring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s capitalist fervor. He will be remembered for his good fortune _ he got a recession out of the way at the beginning of his tenure _ and for maximizing his opportunities. In the midst of the downturn, he won approval for big tax cuts that launched the longest peacetime expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. He held two economic tenets dear: Taxes should be cut and the federal bureaucracy should be trimmed. Because he proved a better tax cutter than program pruner, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boom created a burgeoning federal budget deficit that kept interest rates inordinately high even as the economy expanded. Plugging the holes in Reaganomics fell to <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who controlled the money supply _ and thus interest rates _ with the perspective of a tortoise to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hare. Where all the president's men saw growth, the apostate <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> smelled inflation and resolved to keep a grip on monetary policy even as Reaganites jawboned for easier credit. For his steadfastness, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman earned the unofficial title of `` second most powerful man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Oddly, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> was never seen as a political threat to the president, perhaps because his tight-money policies kept the worst excesses of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution in check. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appeal was founded in his bold pursuit of ideals at the expense of opposing interests. Executives admired his guts when he fired the striking air controllers in 1981; labor leaders never forgave him. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, too, was somewhat of an idealist, but he had bitter medicine for all to swallow, consumers and fat cats alike. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> put restrictions on business in the form of tight credit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dismantled government regulation at every turn. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited all businesses to the party; <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> and his inflation-fighting successor, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, were the designated drivers. Putting an ironic twist on an old <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> saw: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could not have been <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, if <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> had n't been <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>. The expansion, still intact after seven years, would not have been as powerful or as enduring without the countervailing forces of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s whip and <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s tug on the reins.

<HEAD>Milken, Pickens, Lorenzo: The New Capitalists</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 By reviving laissez faire as a guiding principle of government, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> set the stage for a new brand of capitalist in 1980s. Government scrutiny was out; wheeling and dealing was in. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> became giants, not by inheritance or formal succession to the chief executive's office, but by taking full advantage of the market's new freedoms. They did n't develop any new products; they employed old tools to new ends. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, a bond trader, took high-risk corporate bonds off the junk heap and created a $ 200 billion market for debt financing. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, an oilman, showed how to hit gushers in the stock market by snapping up the shares of companies undervalued in comparison to their assets. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MBA </ORGANIZATION> with a fascination for flying, assembled the nation's biggest airline empire under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> by buying up deregulated carriers and busting unions. Sympathetic biographers would label all three self-made me, but they were not the sort of cuddly entrepreneurs Americans instinctively embrace. Indeed their greatest successes prompted more cocked eyebrows than applause. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was indicted for securities fraud. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> was branded a `` raider.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, after flying two airlines into bankruptcy and putting hundreds of union employees out of work, became known as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s toughest bosses. As three of the greatest risk-takers of the age, each was stalked as much as he hunted his own prey. But they were characteristically unbowed by challenge or criticism. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, a recent magazine profile noted, survived on the conviction of his own rightness. So, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> in the face of his 1990 trial. So, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> in his raids, most recently on a Japanese company. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s comment when he bought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 was typical of the threesome's sober acceptance of controversy. `` There ai n't no <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' he told a news conference.

<HEAD>Iacocca and Morita: National Symbols</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> were tough guys with a better press. They attracted enemies, but managed their images with aplomb. As a result, they became instant national symbols. The <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman got a billion-dollar bailout from the federal government as the decade opened, but paid the debt in 1983, seven years ahead of schedule. To flaunt the extraordinary payback, he held a lavish press conference where he stood before a mammoth blowup of a check for $ 800 million, the company's final payment. His success at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, after being fired from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, was as much a personal victory as a corporate one. He personally sold <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the bailout and became the company's main pitchman for K-cars and minivans in national television commercials Exposure was his magic wand. When he was fired from the Statue of Liberty restoration committee in a political snit in 1986, he wrapped himself in the flag and called the ouster `` un-American.'' Most <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> fans agreed. <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, became the Japanese answer to <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, but with an even tougher PR challenge. Besides selling himself and his company, he had to sell a whole nation of aggressive capitalists to skeptical Americans. A natural salesman and communicator in the Iacocca mold, <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> seemed to sense what was needed to salve old postwar sores. After <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, he hugged recording star <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> for a magazine cover photo, symbolically embracing the culture. When <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> this fall, he paid millions to get the services of a pair of American producers, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, creators of hits `` Batman'' and `` Rain Man.'' And, of course, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> kept churning out gizmos for American consumers. Who could hate a guy bringing a Video Walkman to market just in time for Christmas? <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> was no softy: He frequently criticized short-term thinking in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and co-wrote a book discussing the `` decline of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' But when the book provoked a backlash in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he apologized for promoting nationalistic views. The secret to the success of stars like <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> was their political sensitivity and their mastery of the media. Few business leaders of the age stood as tall outside the boardroom or the plant.

<HEAD>Jobs: Thirtysomething Entrepreneur</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 One man combined popular allure with real genius: <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>. He was the American dream updated to the'80s. The garage inventor who struck it rich. A thirtysomething <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alger </PERSON>. In a sense Jobs was the consummate business leader of the decade. He was young. He invented computers, the machine of the age. He walked away from a very successful company just to start another one. He built the <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> empire only to leave it in 1985 after introducing one of the hottest computer boxes of the decade, the Macintosh. Jobs left the company in a dispute with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON>, a veteran businessman whom <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> himself had recruited to help run his growing firm. What mattered most to Jobs was not running a company, but creating hot boxes. His subsequent creation, the product of a few wizards' work, was appropriately labeled `` Next.'' His trademark long hair sometimes gave way to a yuppie trim, and he seemed to enjoy the panache of bow ties and designer suits as much as his faded blue jeans. But there was no mistaking what he represented. As the rebellious youth beating the old capitalist establishment at its own game, Jobs provided a fitting symbol for a decade that followed the'70s.

 It's been 10 years since <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> hurdled society's gender and racial barriers to win her first corporate management job with the nation's fifth-largest retailing company. From a retail training program at a Gimbles department store in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, she arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> in 1975 as a merchandise buyer. Five years later, she emerged as the division head for intimate apparel and has since risen into company officer ranks as the general manager for shoes, cosmetics, accessories and intimate apparel _ the first black woman to hold such a post at the $ 1.7 billion subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It showed me that your dreams can become reality and I knew it was just the beginning,'' <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said of her big promotion in 1980. In a decade noted for the pursuit of money, <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> is among the hard-chargers who poured productive energy into the longest peacetime economic expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Her career also stands out among the thousands of women who entered the work force and moved up the corporate ladder in the'80s. Since 1982 <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> has consistently met or surpassed sales goals for her $ 440 million division, and earlier this year she was invited to join the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of 200 _ an elite national group of women executives. <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> and her husband, Dr. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> dentist, are fixtures in the Twin Cities establishment. They have a `` status'' house in the exclusive suburb of <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, an investment professional to help manage their income, a live-in caretaker with a master's degree in education to nurture their 4-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Phallon </PERSON>, and plenty of money to vacation. If only they had more time. <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said she's on the road up to 40 percent of the year, including trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Orient. Her work week can easily mount to 60 hours. Hence the decision 2 -LCB- years ago to hire <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON>'s college friend, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, to help care for <PERSON> Phallon </PERSON>. `` It was when the pressures were getting real tight,'' <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said. `` She came to help us in managing our family and our future.'' <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said the frenzy of meshing her career with motherhood has prompted some to put her in the category of superwoman. But she detests the label for the expectations it carries. `` I do n't want that superwoman cape,'' she said. `` I'm like every other woman. I do the best I can.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, summed up <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON>'s reputation in two words: `` High energy.'' Raised in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> by a mother who worked as a beautician and a father who drove a truck, <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said she was warned not to give up on her goals in the face of racism or other adversity. Her father's tombstone reads: `` I may give out, but I'll never give up.'' `` I've had to succeed in a white world,'' <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said. `` But there has never been a doubt to anyone of who I am.'' Despite lofty job offers from the outside, <PERSON> Lauderback </PERSON> said she is content for now to stay with the 37-store <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> chain. Harking back to her promotion at the start of the'80s, she said she has the best of several worlds: A job, paycheck and family she loves. `` I felt like I was on a cloud then and I have stayed on that cloud for quite a while.''

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON>, a victim of the farm depression of the 1980s, says losing his farm and seeing someone else work the land was `` like watching someone else live with your wife.'' It was Oct. 19, 1987 _ a day known as `` Black Monday'' on Wall Street half a continent away _ that <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> signed the deed of his farm over to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Some of that land had been in his family for three generations. The 440-acre corn, cattle and hog operation in the rolling hills of west central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, not far from the spot where <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> is reputed to have staged the first train robbery in the West, became another statistic in a faltering agricultural economy. `` The land is kind of attached to you. It's kind of like losing your arm,'' said <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON>. His wife, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, interrupted, saying, `` No, it's more like losing your heart.'' <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> and his wife say that after 20 straight years of making payments, they failed to meet a $ 35,000 annual mortgage installment in 1985 because new management at a local bank refused to continue a long-standing operating loan arrangement. `` We thought we had the operating money for the year put together. A couple of weeks before we needed it, we found we did n't have it,' he said <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> says it was a shift in inflation policy and resulting high interest rates that did him in. In the 1970s, `` It was a common belief that inflation always would be with us,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harl </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and expert on agricultural economics. Inflationary expectations drove farmland values sky high, which boosted the borrowing power of farmers, who used that asset as collateral for loans. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s move to fight inflation with tighter credit in 1979 drove interest rates to record heights and sent land values tumbling. At the same time, a rising dollar made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and meat more expensive in foreign markets, cutting into farmers' traditional export earnings Drought hit in 1983, and <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> says he never did catch up. Net cash farm income in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the difference between cash earnings and cash expenses and a gauge of the money available to repay debts or invest in operations or savings, sank from about $ 2.7 billion in 1981 to around $ 1.6 billion in 1984. Farmland values in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> plummeted 71 percent from 1980 to 1987 after adjusting for inflation, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, a plunge even steeper than the 61 percent inflation-adjusted slump of 1916-1942. The slide eroded the security backing up loans held by the Kilcoins and others. `` We had a profit but interest rates ate up all profits and we had to borrow money just to pay the interest rates,'' <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> said in a discussion at the table in a kitchen that has a 20-year-old stove, a used refrigerator and a dishwasher bought for $ 6 in a garage sale in the 1970s. `` It was n't that we were n't making money; we were n't making enough money.'' Now 51, <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> has learned a new trade, making engine bearings. He has become a commuter who has time for his children only on weekends and goes to community college one day a week. `` I still walk though the door -LRB- at work -RRB- and the door shuts behind me and I think, ` Is this really me?''' He's far from alone in his plight, despite the rebound in the agricultural economy as the decade ended, with <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> net cash farm income shooting up to nearly $ 3.9 billion in 1987 and then settling to $ 3.4 billion last year. `` The people I work with are the same people _ either they are my age, farmed and lost or young people who wished they could farm but ca n't,'' <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> said. His wife, 49, works at home assembling small parts for car and truck chassis for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, earning about $ 200 a week _ enough to meet payments on a used minivan and buy the groceries. But before those jobs materialized, it was touch and go for the family with three married daughters and a 13-year-old girl and 6-year-old boy at home. For two years the couple did not know if they would keep their home, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> says he told his wife he was ready to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if he lost the house. But the Kilcoins negotiated to buy back the home and 13 -LCB- acres that surround it. They refused to declare bankruptcy and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> says, `` we will be paying the rest of our lives on our debt.'' Butnow, things are more settled. `` I do n't have to worry about the phone ringing any more. I do n't have to be afraid of going to the mailbox,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> said. The couple still keeps a hand in farming, too. They fatten about 600 hogs for market under contract for a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> feedlot. They also own 18 head of cattle. <PERSON> Kilcoin </PERSON> still has worries, including fears for his country, which he sees overburdened by debt _ just as farmers were at the start of the decade. `` That puts them in the position I was,'' he said. `` Who shuts down the government?''

 They wrote the book on business in the 1980s _ over and over and over, until it seemed there were fewer executives than authors telling them how to succeed. Choose your approach: Management by walking around. The flat organization. Quality circles -LRB- actually a holdover from the 1970s -RRB-. Zero defects. How `` soft'' management skills create `` hard'' business results. `` How to Give Good Phone'' was an offering from <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> <PERSON> Cool </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>'s Superselling'' a tome by the <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> sidekick and <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> pitchman. The scene for all this was set in 1982 by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s `` In Search of Excellence,'' which proved that critically well-received management books can also be money-makers. Then came `` Iacocca,'' followed by a string of best-sellers in the mid -'80s _ `` Megatrends,'' `` The One Minute Manager,'' `` What They Do n't Teach You at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> `` Those three books sold between 500,000 and 1.5 million copies each, which was unheard of,'' said business book editor <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. The floodgates opened. `` Publishing is definitely a follow-the-leader business, and when something works they jump on the bandwagon,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miliot </PERSON>, editor of the B.P. Report, a publishing newsletter in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y. `` Intrapreneuring.'' `` Thriving on Chaos.'' `` You Are the Message.'' `` Corporate Cultures.'' `` Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun.'' <PERSON> Miliot </PERSON> said the books fit right in during the'80s, with `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the business-is-great attitude and free enterprise at its best.'' But were they worth reading? `` Most of these books are shallow, insipid and stupid,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, the longtime business consultant and writer called the `` Dr. <PERSON> Spock </PERSON> for generations of American business managers'' by Business Week. `` Everyone was trying to emulate <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, 80, the author of 24 books, said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, the book editor, agrees most of the books are `` dull and they're badly written. `` People were buying them, but they sort of used them as intellectual wallpaper, or on the desk as a placebo,'' she said. But unlike <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, she thinks there's a market for yet more business books in the 1990s. In fact, <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON> has hired her as executive editor of a whole new line, Doubleday-Currency books advertised as being dedicated to business `` thinkers, not just doers,'' who `` rebel against the status quo.'' `` Who today can start a fire in our minds?'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> writes in publicity material for the books. `` The Iacoccas succeeded in the old world of hierarchy, authority, and control, which has less relevance today.'' According to Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, `` The new hot button is no longer ` entrepreneur' or ` executive' but ` change agent.' That revolutionary is our ideal reader.'' `` Business people would buy ` In Search of Excellence,' ` Thriving on Chaos' and ` Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun,''' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But the books they would actually read ... were in the sciences, philosophy, pop culture,'' she said. `` They were trying to make sense of complex lives.'' The flagship publication of the new line is `` Leadership Is an Art'' by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> DePree </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Herman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> furniture makers, out this fall and already in its fifth printing with 65,000 copies in print. `` It's the opposite of ` Confessions of an S.O.B.,' or ` Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun,''' said <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Deval </PERSON>. `` His leadership principles are based on a concern for the health and welfare of the people working for you,'' Ms. <PERSON> Deval </PERSON> said. `` And not just for the sake of being kinder or gentler, but for overall profitability as well, the bottom line.'' <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, the dean of the management gurus, likes <PERSON> DePree </PERSON>'s book but hopes the business-book fad as a whole gets laid to rest. `` The boom is over _ I hope,'' <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON> said glumly. `` But I've been saying that for two years now and I've been wrong so far.

<HEAD>In the '80s, Reaching for the Brass Ring Required a MBA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To those who received MBAs in 1981, Wall Street beckoned like a siren's song. Although a recession gripped the nation, the securities industry and investment banks were on their way to reshaping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses _ and they were hiring legions of fresh MBAs to do the job. Takeovers, restructurings and stock and bond offerings became fortune-making vehicles for an army of young people. Tales of 23-year-olds with $ 300,000 salaries plus bonuses abounded and lured flocks of people to the nation's business schools. But what a difference a decade makes. These days, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s financial district is quiet and depressed. Tens of thousands of people were let go following the Oct. 19, 1987, market collapse. The stock market's unsettling volatility this fall has hurt new hiring plans. `` No new people are coming into the securities industry,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, an'81 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MBA </ORGANIZATION> grad and vice president at the investment research boutique of <ORGANIZATION> Gerard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Lucrative fees from megadeals withered this year as the dollar volume of takeovers slumped 28 percent from 1988's heady pace, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Investment houses have scaled back commissions and shut entire departments to save money Some estimate bonuses will be trimmed by as much as 30 percent this year. The big salaries that deal people commanded during'80s `` were clearly out of line _ and they still are,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and 1981 MBA graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Starting salaries for MBAs doubled over the course of the decade. <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said the average salary for grads entering all facets of business was $ 26,936 in 1981; the average broke the $ 50,000 mark this year. -LRB- The cost of getting the degree has nearly tripled at some schools. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is charging $ 30,700 for the two-year MBA course that cost $ 9,600 in 1981. -RRB- A recent <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION> survey shows male 1979 MBA grads are averaging $ 122,600 a year while their female classmates are making $ 87,200 on average. And the respondents _ 143 of out of 665 alumni polled _ have averaged three promotions since leaving <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION>. But for those hitting the pavement in 1991, the degree that once opened doors could become an impediment at some job interviews. Some speculate that with scrutiny of the bottom line, employers may not readily embrace the high-priced grad clutching a master's of business administration degree. `` People think the MBA is a ticket to a higher life,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, 31, chief operating officer at the <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Caliper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Sure, they are averaging higher salaries, but in the end it comes down to what an individual makes of an opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, an'81 <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION> grad. As Wall Street loses its allure, more grads are seeking to work for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s corporations, and companies are carving out a greater presence on campuses recruiting students. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Avison </PERSON>, 24, expects to put in 60-hour weeks in sales or marketing for a major consumer products corporation when she graduates in 1991 from <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Amos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, MBA candidate <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, 25, said he would n't be surprised if the nation slips into a recession shortly after he graduates, but he says those who develop highly specific skills will fare well. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> hopes to become involved in investment management for a university or charity endowment when he graduates in 1991, a far cry from investment banking. If the business climate sours in the coming decade, as many believe it will, the class of'91 `` may not have been taught, as we were n't, how to deal with it,'' <PERSON> Caliper </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> said. He credits the hard economic times of the early'80s for teaching him more about running a business than business school ever did. `` It's much easier to manage when there's growth,'' said <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, who noted that his consulting firm lost a third of its business between 1981 and 1982. Current students say money is not their primary concern. `` If you work hard, the money will come,'' <PERSON> Avison </PERSON> said. But one recent <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> grad countered that `` making money is an essential consideration, particularly for those attending expensive private schools.'' Still, financial rewards come at a high price. Long hours, broken marriages and a distorted sense of values typified business of the'80s. `` I have seen what is probably a higher incidence of divorce in our industry, I suspect because people are trying to reach for the brass ring,'' <PERSON> Rochman </PERSON> said. `` The spirit of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency was one of hands-off, unfettered pursuit of wealth, even greed,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 37, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> CS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, though he believes the nation is begining to focus on more social concerns. If there is one axiom that holds true, it is, in <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' words, that `` the business world was tough, and it still is.''

<HEAD>Crushing of Air Controllers Strike Set 1980s Anti-Union Agenda</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots and flight attendants gave up a 9-month-old strike in November without much hope of reclaiming their jobs, the surrender came as no surprise. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unprecedented firing of 11,400 striking air traffic controllers in 1981 touched off a decade of retreat for American labor. Many historians say the 1980s will go down as a pivotal era when once-powerful unions faced assault from a mix of political conservatism, deregulation, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s declining economic might and a barrage of corporate takeovers that resulted in unfamiliar owners and sudden layoffs. While more than 12 million people joined the work force in this country, union membership shrank by 3 million and organizers groped for strategies to survive. Corporate clout strengthened as quickly as union power faded. Bosses formerly cowed by the muscle of big labor reclaimed the advantage in contract talks, threatening to close plants and cut jobs unless they got concessions. Union-busting, once the work of hired thugs wielding baseball bats and shotguns, was revived in the form of court orders, clever publicity and right-to-work legislation, labor activists say. `` You do n't look under ` union busters' in the phone book,'' said <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` You look under ` security,' ` attorneys,' and ` public relations firms.''' The decade will be remembered by activists as the time when airline boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> broke unions by enforcing his way in bankruptcy court, and federal prosecutors hobbled the mighty <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union with racketeering charges in criminal court. It will be remembered by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> as the time when <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> recruits of a Japanese carmaker told one of the nation's biggest unions to go away. By the end of the decade, instead of fighting for higher wages, unions were struggling to retain past victories in such areas as health insurance, job security and pensions. Labor also faced assault from another direction, the lure of employees becoming bosses themselves. Employee stock ownership plans multiplied, affecting companies that ranged from lumber mills to car rentals. The rise of ESOPs, as they are called, was part of a larger trend of takeovers and restructurings that sought to maxmize returns to shareholders _ often at the expense of jobholders. `` Clearly the employers have had the initiative in the last 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` This has forced the unions into a more defensive posture.'' The catalyst for the retreat was the ill-fated strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which presented <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with the biggest domestic challenge in the first year of his presidency. He ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss and replace the strikers, stunning the union and temporarily wreaking havoc on the nation's network of commercial air traffic. A few months later, <ORGANIZATION> PATCO </ORGANIZATION> dissolved, most of its members jobless and bitter. `` Obviously when you have a president who goes in and busts a union, it sends a strong signal to other industries,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>. `` If the president can do it, you can, too.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belous </PERSON>, a labor economist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based research group, said the <ORGANIZATION> PATCO </ORGANIZATION> strike marked the end of three decades of union advances. `` It had tremendous symbolism,'' he said. `` The strike gave management the intestinal fortitude to do things it would n't have done before.'' Others said the economy's weakness in the beginning of the decade played an important role in eroding union influence, by undermining the premise that a union shop means secure jobs. Deregulation was another major factor, said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, a division chief at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Where you once had a monopoly dominated by unionized firms, deregulation made it possible for non-union firms to come in and compete.'' Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show about 20.1 million working Americans belonged to unions in 1980, about 23 percent of the total work force. By last year the number of union members had shrunk to 17 million or 16.8 percent of the total. Union leaders contend they are not passive observers in the unraveling of their power. While attention focused on the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s embarassing failure at the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, earlier this year, the Bakery Workers union organized a <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> candy plant down the road. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> itself has organized other professional workers this decade in an effort to diversify. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members now range from office clerks to jai-alai players. Although business groups contend labor's use of the strike is declining because it is ineffective, unions say the strike remains one of their potent weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike against the prosperous <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, was approved overwhelmingly in September and produced a victory for the workers in less than two months. A protracted strike this fall by the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies, forced it to capitulate on a key demand of the strikers, employer-paid health insurance. Organized labor helped defeat the appointment of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, partly because of his perceived anti-union views Perhaps their most important victory of the decade, labor leaders say, was congressional passage of a plant closing law in 1988, which gives workers at least 60 days' notice of layoffs. The law was designed to stem the growing number of companies that have shut factories without warning and moved manufacturing to cheaper locations _ <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. But some say the law is a hollow victory that could discourage potential employers from establishing new businesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some even see the law as a symbol of labor's weakness. `` I think it's going to be a very hard time for labor in the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Belous </PERSON> said. `` Labor has been pushed back from the 40-yard line to the 10-yard line.''

 It was almost unimaginable. The West's most prominent banker jetting to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to advise the archenemy of capitalism But <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> recently made such a trip, a sign of the extraordinary changes that marked the'80s overseas. It was a decade marked by the pursuit of a formula for economic success, a drive that brought about wrenching changes. The big winners were the most modern, complex and open economies. Far down on the list were those dependent on natural resources and those with closed, controlled systems. In <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, some countries took their first, halting steps toward Western-style economies and integration into the world economy. In <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> finally took seriously its decision to fashion a single market of the dozen nations by 1992. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries went on a roller-coaster ride that carried oil prices to wild levels before crashing and finally recovering. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was caught up in the foreign debt crisis that swept the world's developing nations in the early 1980s, sapping their economic strength and impoverishing their growing populations even more. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the events that captured the imagination, that seemed least likely at the start of the decade, stemmed from the Soviets' tacit acknowledgement that their economic system had failed Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who came to power in March 1985, pressed his perestroika program to restructure the backward economy, trying to wrench it from centrally planned ways to a more market-oriented system. There was talk of price reform and private enterprise, more consumer goods and fewer government subsidies. `` There can be no return to the old style of economic management,'' asserted <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shemiatenkov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s envoy to the European Community. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s task remains staggering. Inflation is high and so is the government's budget deficit. Millions have been thrown out of work by the modernization efforts. Workers strike and consumers grumble. `` They do n't have a decent economic reform program yet,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PlanEcon </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. Despite the daunting challenge, reform fever is spreading in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, long a leader of economic reform in the communist bloc, and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the new Solidarity leadership plans to move swiftly to a market economy. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, once one of the most conservative members of the Soviet bloc, joined the rush. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> offered massive financial aid in return for stepped-up economic and political reforms. The European Community quickly negotiated broad trade and economic cooperation agreements with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and a smaller pact with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Deals also were pursued with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Among the Western powers, a wealth of proposals were offered for reaching their goal of a European-wide market by 1992. In contrast to the new freedoms symbolized by the crumbling <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall, the 1992 preparations were characterized by heated disagreements over ways to dismantle the barriers separating the Common Market allies. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> clashed with others in their vision of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future. She fought proposals to create a common currency and central bank system, fearing a loss of sovereignty. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s destiny lies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' argued <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, whose October resignation as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top treasury official rocked the government. He urged Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to relent and link the pound to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s other major currencies. The linkage system, the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, has brought the economies more in line, analysts say. With the opening of borders between the Germanys, concern was raised that the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government would forsake the West for the East. Government officials hastily insisted they were with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aggressively monitored the community's 1992 campaign, complaining of any moves to keep its products out of the new marketplace. The term `` Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' was coined. Europeans denied protectionism was afoot. For <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, the decade was trying. The 1979 revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a major oil-producing nation, was marked by a sharp drop in crude production. World oil prices soared above $ 40 a barrel, shocking the economies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrialized nations. In late 1985, the cartel shifted strategy to defend its `` fair share'' of the world oil market. A production free-for-all sent prices crashing. Futures prices for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark American crude, plunged to near $ 10 a barrel in March 1986. Toward the decade's end, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pulled itself together. Key members <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, at war most of the decade, resolved some differences, and the cartel as a whole became less confrontational with consuming nations. Demand for the cartel's oil grew, and prices rebounded to around $ 20 per barrel. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the'80s were years of unrelieved misery. `` <LOCATION> Sub-Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a whole has now witnessed almost a decade of falling per-capita incomes, increasing hunger and accelerating ecological degradation,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> report. Problems afflicting the region of 450 million people include low foreign investment, weak export sales, growing populations, increasing debt and poor agricultural and industrial performance.

<HEAD>Japan Excels Economically; ``Four Tigers'' in Pursuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL BROWN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a decade of Asian economic success, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> piled up No. 1 labels, four other countries gained the nickname `` tigers,'' and the star performers amassed more money to fuel their advance into the 1990s. The standouts lack abundant natural resources, but have governments that encourage private business. They share a Confucian ethic stressing education, hard work and thrift. High savings rates have helped pay for new and better production facilities. Dependence on exports forced factories to hone efficiencies needed to compete in the international marketplace. Government steps to hold down inflation promoted confidence and stability. Success in the frontrunners _ including `` tigers'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> _ helped pull up some of the followers, like <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, both by example and by expanding trade and investment. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s giant, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, also tried stressing a diligence-thrift ethic to make its 1 billion people more productive and less poor, but lacked the incentives of its neighbors' free-market economies and their managerial skills and education levels. Amid scarcities, spending on construction and efforts to live better ended up overheating the economy. War impoverished <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, although <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ended the decade by withdrawing what it said were its last troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and trying to free its economy from some of the strictures of central planning. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, amid a intensifying political crisis, struggled with a legacy of foreign debt from the rule of the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, whose businessmen associates came to rely more on favors than initiative. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> struggled with problems of the rich as its high exports and high-profile acquisitions abroad aroused resentment. It became the world's largest creditor in 1985 and the rise of the yen inflated its international financial power. In 1987, the economic newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> calculated that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had become the world's richest nation on paper, with $ 43.7 trillion in total assets such as land, factories and stock, compared with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets of $ 36.2 trillion. The inflated wealth, plus <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s high savings rate and its industries' new ability to finance their own investments, gave Japanese banks the funds to become major players in world finance. Japanese purchases of corporations and property in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became a sensitive issue, although Americans continued seeking Japanese investment. The abundance of funds in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock markets also has given its corporations access to low-cost financing that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies can not match. American corporations with access to such funds likely would be tempted to try to buy out a competitor, said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Jardine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while Japanese firms tend to focus on productive capacity. `` Come 1991 or 1992, life could get very exciting for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. They are going to emerge from a period of sluggish growth and long recuperation ... confronted with a flood of high-quality Japanese exports,'' he said. This will be a result of Japanese companies' strong balance sheets rather than an overall national strategy, he said. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, too, `` companies used to rely on banks as their main source of funds. Now they can raise more money from the stock market and do n't have to worry about banks withdrawing loans in case of an economic slowdown,'' said <PERSON> Yeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chih-yung </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said many of the 170 listed companies have used such funds to automate equipment and make more sophisticated products to overcome the impact of the rising <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollar In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the yen's rise since 1985 forced a major change in mid-decade, from reliance on exports to depending on the home market to fuel economic growth. But despite their country's image, most Japanese do n't feel rich, says <PERSON> Isamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. He cited workdays exceeding those in the West by perhaps 600 hours a year; cramped housing and long commutes through congested traffic; and prices that, while stable, exceed other industrialized nations' by 20 percent to 30 percent. These result from government protection of agriculture and an inefficient distribution system, he said. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said curbs on government budgets and wage raises kept annual inflation between 2.3 percent and 7.1 percent, down from more than 15 percent in the previous decade. The government also encouraged competition to sharpen efficiency, and stressed technical renovation. Labor unrest has erupted in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> over the last year, however. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, rural production improved as the government ended factory-style commune farming and gave families a chance to do some of their own marketing and use spare time for sideline business. But in the state-run factories, efforts to boost productivity faced the `` iron rice bowl,'' a system of lifetime employment in which workers are paid the same regardless of labor performed. After cracking down on the democracy movement in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> promoted leaders favoring order and central planning over giving wider play to market forces. The next two largest <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nations _ <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> _ also lag in education, with <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s literacy rate at 26 percent and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s at 36 percent. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has given <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> high marks in recent years for boosting growth by encouraging the private sector with improved incentives and deregulation, and moving to shift the economy away from heavy reliance on oil exports. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s government has favored state planning in efforts to reduce income inequalities and promote rapid industrialization, but analysts say this inward-looking policy has hurt efficiency and growth. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, which looks toward <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in its economic activity, shares its more successful neighbors' free-market economy and high education level, but its economic performance depends more than theirs on prices for commodities. Its major exports include coal and farm products.

<HEAD>A `Lost Decade' for Latin America; Foreign Debt a Millstone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1980s brought an explosion of prosperity to developed countries but was a `` lost decade'' for many Latin American nations that experienced more wretchedness than glorious excess. Living standards fell sharply as an estimated $ 204 billion flowed out of the region, most to service a collective foreign debt of $ 430 billion. `` The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name written with capital letters _ FOREIGN DEBT,'' <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said in March after anti-government riots in which 300 were killed and 2,000 injured. `` Budget adjustments, austerity programs and economic stagnation have made the 1980s the lost decade,'' <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s president, said at a Latin summit last year. During the 1970s, borrowing spurred economic development throughout the region, most notably in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s so-called miracle of double-digit annual growth and low inflation. Railroads, steel mills, copper mines, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, airports, highways, ports and subways were constructed from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frontier thousands of miles south to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the last stop before <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Development seemed to accompany democracy, as civilians replaced soldiers in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1981, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in 1982, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1983, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> in 1985. Borrowing grew on a large scale, despite a steady rise in interest rates and shrinkage of trade surpluses. It continued almost to the moment <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ the biggest Third World debtors _ were forced to suspend repayments. That development in mid-1982 set off shock waves in corporate boardrooms and government corridors, and prompted projections of a rupture in the world banking system. While that did not happen, the rest of the decade was filled with bitter sparring between bankers and bureaucrats, the former trying to dam the flow of red ink and the latter juggling credit needs against a rising tide of malnutrition, illiteracy and homelessness. The average per-capita income of an Argentine was $ 1,990 in 1980, and $ 360 less in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> figures show. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s gross national product shrank for seven straight years Real wages in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> have slipped by one-third since 1981, and now are estimated at the 1964 level. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which under the rightist regime of President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> pursued policies of export expansion and a balanced budget ahead of most neighbors, was not as badly hurt. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, and until this year <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which has huge oil deposits, usually fulfilled their debt obligations on time, albeit with difficulty as world commodity prices plunged. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is a special case. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> capped debt repayment at 10 percent of export earnings, a move that shut the country out of international credit markets. Explosive growth was followed by hyperinflation and recession. In most Latin countries, debt repayments during the 1980s took up ever larger shares of national budgets, leaving less money for public housing, schools, hospitals. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> alloted 20 percent of its budget to education in 1972 and only 6 percent in 1986. Roads deteriorated. Completion of <ORGANIZATION> Yacyreta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, one of the largest construction projects in the world, was postponed. Work on <LOCATION> Xingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, the biggest public project under way in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, was halted in October. Investment dried up. Today's factories are obsolete. A drought that shifted electricity production to coal - and oil-fired generators resulted in brownouts in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> earlier this year Nine of every 10 cars in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are at least 5 years old. By printing money in part to pay the debt, Latin nations brought on devaluations, ruinous inflation and recession. Three months after the rioting in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> this year, hungry Argentines sacked food stores in cities surrounded by wheat fields, dairy farms and some of the world's most fertile cropland. Brazilian presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> reflected the emotions _ and rhetoric _ the debt issue can generate when he said during his campaign leading up to national elections on Nov. 15: `` The Third World War has already started. ... It is a war by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against the Latin American continent and the Third World. It is war over the foreign debt, one which has as its main weapon interest -LRB- payments -RRB-, a weapon more deadly than the atomic bomb.'' As the decade ends, a resolution seems closer than at any time since 1982. Latin leaders talk less of moratoriums and acknowledge that many of their economic problems are the result not of the debt but of government fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. Much of the debt was spent to balance budgets, subsidize food prices, maintain unrealistic exchange rates and buy military weapons, they acknowledge, rather than to create an infrastructure that would repay it. Billions of dollars were squandered in bribes, kickbacks, illegal commissions and graft. Perhaps too much money was borrowed. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s main debt negotiator, said, `` It's indispensable not to forget the lessons of our own history and recent past We can not repeat the error of taking on excessive debt.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s total current debt is $ 110 billion. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes $ 107.4 billion; <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, $ 65 billion; <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, $ 35 billion. They are the four biggest debtors in the developing world. Bankers now seem to agree that economic growth must precede repayment, and that much of the debt is unpayable, as Latin leaders have argued for years. Lending institutions are accepting proposals they once resisted: lower interest rates, deferred principal payments, debt-equity swaps, outright forgiveness. Meanwhile, governments of many countries are selling off state-owned enterprises and giving capitalism a chance. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, said he is optimistic that early in the 1990s the debt `` crisis'' will abate. Latin countries will have easier access to international credit, he predicted, and banks will be paid what they are owed. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s recent agreement with creditors to exchange debt for 30-year bonds, and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s offer to set aside oil revenues as collateral to banks willing to write down their loans. Late in 1989, even defiant <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> said it would resume payments on overdue loans to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. When the Mexican debt relief plan was announced last July, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> voiced the hope of all who had struggled with the problem: `` The result does not mean that by magic our problems have ceased to exist. ... we will have to keep working, but each day will be a little better.''

 There are many reasons to question whether <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic and political dominance in world affairs will continue. A major concern centers around the erosion that has occurred in American manufacturing. If we look at individual segments, some are now controlled completely by foreign competitors, and others are losing their dominance. Weakness in our industrial base hurts our national ability to compete. As more and more industries decline, the manufacturers that rely upon them lose a competitive advantage. Japanese automakers, for example, enjoy the advantage of a leading edge not only in such industries as consumer electronics and semiconductors, but also in machine tools, optics and many more. These industries constantly furnish the Japanese auto industry with new ideas and products. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we are slowly losing the advantages of similar partnerships as more and more sectors of our industrial base weaken. Does <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have time to catch up? Yes, we do; but our work extends far beyond individual industries to larger problems in our society. In education, statistics indicate we are losing ground. Students 14 years old and older are dropping out of school at a rate of 700,000 annually. Thirteen percent of all 17-year-olds who are still in school are `` functionally illiterate.'' In capital investment, we are far behind the other major industrial economies in the percentage of gross national product we invest in modernizing our factories and offices. In October, The Wall Street Journal described the capital spending boom that is under way in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Overall, Japanese capital spending this year will be more than $ 520 billion, 5 percent more than American companies will spend. Yet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total output is less than two-thirds of ours. Not all of this spending will go to build new capacity. The Journal reported that 14 percent will be spent on new or improved products; 17 percent will be used to cut costs; and 12 percent will be for research and development. Clearly, we have our work cut out for us if we hope to compete in an environment such as this. In today's global market, no nation has a long-term advantage in technology, managerial wisdom or creativity. Expertise _ `` intellectual capital'' _ abounds all over the globe. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can compete in this environment _ if we choose to. But to succeed, we must pay strict attention to certain time-proven fundamentals. Four are particularly critical: product quality, keeping the customer in sharp focus, cost control that does not sacrifice investment, and most important, rediscovering the value of the employees who do the work and generate the ideas. Can American leadership in world affairs continue? Certainly, but we must make significant long-term progress in two key areas. Education is the first. The national crisis in primary and secondary education must be resolved. But we can not stop here. More of our brightest students must seek careers in science, mathematics and engineering. Second, we must strengthen our industrial base by manufacturing more of our vital components. It is always easy to buy things from someone else. But rebuilding our industrial base will require investment in the necessary plants and technology. This is hard work, and the payback often can be far down the road. Yet, we have no choice if we want to succeed. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in a race that we can not refuse to run. If we are to cross the finish line, it will take much time and a great deal of hard work. Today's problems were a long time in the making, and they will not be solved with short-term actions. Yet, with resolve and commitment, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can continue to prosper and lead.

 It has been said for a long time that the world is shifting from a bipolar structure, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> having overwhelming influence, to a multipolar one. The situation is changing quickly now. Symbolized by the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, there is rapid reconciliation between East and West. There are calls to build a new political and economic order for the world in the 21st century, and expectations are mounting for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to exercise its leadership. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began the rebuilding of a strong <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ready and able to act as a true world leader. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken over where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left off and moved forward. This is especially so in the area of economic revitalization, and the future outlook appears to be bright. Without doubt, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began to face up to its problems with the `` twin deficits'' in the area of the macroeconomy in the 1980s. However, I would like to make note of the voices gradually growing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry to make efforts to improve productivity and quality and to become more export-oriented. I see it as evidence of a significant turning point for the overall economy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Especially notable was the report last June by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> entitled `` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' It was a proposal to bolster <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing industry, and it clearly pointed out problems in industry and indicated directions for improvement. The report: _ Criticized the pursuit of short-term profit _ Said there was overconfidence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology and delay in adapting to technological innovation _ Found a lack of efforts to improve quality _ Found disharmony in actions of the government and private sector _ Recommended increased investment, better education of the work force, a more harmonized and cooperative relationship between organizations and their employees, and more international thinking It is certainly true that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership of the world's politics and economies since World War II has been sustained by its industrial competitiveness, based on its eminent productivity and technological strength Now, since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has begun to reconstruct its manufacturing industry, I believe the revitalization of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is real, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to hold the reins of power, leading the world politically and economically in the future. Many Japanese corporations, determined to satisfy changing customer wants and needs, have been opening up factories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to put production close to the consumer. We are making efforts to expand local employment, increase the local-content ratio of our products and blend into local communities. In other words, we have been establishing ourselves as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations. As international business activities continue to transcend national boundaries, the need to bolster <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial competitiveness has already become an important issue, not only for corporations with bases and business operations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but also for us, corporations based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. We, as international business people, would like to contribute to the further strengthening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy.

<HEAD>Rewards of the Money Decade Weren't Equally Shared</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was a common theme throughout the'80s, at the dinner table, in academic papers, White House discussions, political controversies, international debates. The subject was money, and it was on everyone's mind. Money was the biggest economic puzzle of the decade, for those who made an awful lot of it, for those who fell far behind in their material well being, and for those who simply struggled to keep pace. If wealth was n't discussed, it was poverty; if not inflation, then the threat of it; if not immediate monthly bills, then the prospect that <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and private insurance plans would n't take care of one's old age Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> worried about a huge and growing federal deficit and a trade imbalance that threatened <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s global economic leadership. Banks worried. The nation's big commercial institutions had made billions of dollars in loans to the Third World, and it had become apparent those loans might never be repaid. Late in the decade, the banks began writing them off, or setting aside reserves for that possibility. Business worried. A new definition of debt took hold. It meant that enormous amounts of money borrowed at extremely high interest rates was now an accepted method of financing corporations. Company after company was threatened with takeover by raiders armed with billions of dollars in such credit. Investors worried about the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average pierced new levels, poking above the 2,700 mark in 1987 and again in 1989, but the market suffered its worst collapse in half a century on Black Monday. In spite of the huge runup, those 2,700 points did n't represent a new high in real terms. Adjusted for inflation the Dow hit its all-time high way back in January 1966. To match that high, the 1989 Dow would have had to reach 3,900 points. Buyers, sellers and owners of housing worried, too, as variable rate mortgages rose into the double digits and then descended toward single numbers late in the decade. Real estate taxes generally rose as well. A big income tax cut was passed to roaring acclaim early in the decade, but almost every dollar saved as a result of it was nibbled away by piecemeal increases that followed. Ordinary Americans never were relieved of money worries. While all those big billions were talked about, average hourly earnings of many Americans grew little in the 1980s. Aspirations did n't _ they kept rising _ and as a result consumer debt did also. Unsolicited bank-card credit became available in the thousands of dollars to millions of Americans who, just a decade earlier, would n't have qualified for personal loans at a fraction of the amounts. The unevenness persisted throughout the decade, beginning in one of the worst recessions of the century, accompanied by what President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> referred to as a malaise of the American spirit. A new president helped lift spirits, talking a free-enterprise language based in faith that what the country needed was a release of the pent-up energies of Americans _ their innovativeness, their willingness to work hard, their desire to participate and contribute and be proud. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised to remove bureaucratic shackles that inhibited business, to deregulate industries, to take a more relaxed view of antitrust enforcement, to lower taxes. What resulted, and who should be blamed or credited, will be debated until the end of the century. Business did indeed pick up, and before the decade was over, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods were becoming competitive at home and abroad. The gross national product, $ 2.63 trillion as the decade began, reached more than $ 5 trillion in 1989. Trade deficits continued, however, and some Americans were astonished to realize that it was the money from their purchases of foreign goods that helped finance foreign takeovers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and real estate, and pay for foreign purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. Big as they were, the gains in gross national product worried many people because the numbers were swollen by inflation. In constant, or `` real'' dollars _ using the same 1982 buying power to measure GNP in both 1980 and 1989 _ the figures were $ 3.2 trillion for 1980 and about $ 4.1 trillion for 1989. Real corporate profits soared. New-business formations rose. More than 20 million jobs were created. Women went to work in growing numbers, and many of the elderly came out of retirement to join teen-agers in part-time positions at grocery stores and retail outlets. The spirit of free enterprise was contagious, but the rewards were n't equally shared. While the new sense of freedom displayed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s strengths, it also showed weaknesses. Economic laissez faire made for an erratic, even chaotic economic course, one that sometimes moved in questionable directions. Stock market manipulations became almost commonplace; corporate takeover artists `` blackmailed'' companies with unfriendly takeovers if they did n't pay their way out of it; the stock market became more volatile, made so by trading schemes whose goals were instant profits; debt rose precipitously; financial scandals eroded faith in both industry and certain government officials. The economy operated at a high level, but it was n't well balanced. To some, it was a high-wire act uncomfortable to watch because of the constant fear of a slip. Many were left out; it was claimed by some economists that the number of people below the poverty line rose. When inflation was subtracted from hourly wages they were barely higher as the decade ended. Thousands of farmers went broke. The stock market was shunned by many individual investors. And a large number of young households found buying a house an unaffordable challenge. After seven years of expansion, the spread of economic benefits was inconsistent by any measure. At one point in 1986, economic strength was so geographically warped that the entire mid-section of the country was strained by simultaneous weakness in farming, heavy manufacturing, mining and oil. At the same time, the East and West Coasts and parts of the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> enjoyed boom conditions, based on strength in such sectors as recreation, finance and computer-related industries. Such inconsistencies led to questions rather than conclusions. Was something substantial created in the 1980s, or was it sleight of hand? Did <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strengthen itself, or merely create the superficial impression by living off debt, by passing on a huge burden for younger generations to pay? <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> improved in many ways, most people would agree, but even those most convinced of progress wondered also if the economic substructure had been weakened in subtle ways, particularly by debts and deficits. Uncertainty was the nature of the decade, one of extreme pluses and minuses. As the'90s approach, most people are still taking an accounting, and probably will be for years to come.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has acquired a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> as part of its $ 2.5-billion takeover of the British luxury-car maker, the No. 2 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said that by the close of business Friday, it had acquired 77.4 percent of the outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> stock, including the 13 percent it owned prior to Nov. 2.

 Stock prices sagged lower in quiet trading today in the absence of any major economic news to stir investors. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.30 points to 2,720.14 at noon EST.

<HEAD>Disposing of A Mighty Mountain of Trash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is n't a pleasant subject to face around Christmas but it is appropriate to the season. The subject is trash. Americans generate mountains of the stuff, particularly around this time of year, but they do n't like to face the consequences. They like it to disappear from their property, and they do n't like to think about it thereafter. They must like to throw things away _ 3.5 pounds a day, compared with 2.7 pounds a day per person in 1960, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> _ but they do n't like to dwell on the fact that there is no `` away.'' Trash must go into recycling programs, waste-to-energy facilities that burn it or into landfills. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates 85 percent of it goes into landfills, which are filling up and closing down all over the country. Over the past 10 years, according to an authority on the subject, more than half the 18,500 landfills that existed in 1979 have closed, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> now forecasts that by the 1990s only 4,000 will remain open. Conclusion: Much as they like to avoid it, <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must face the issue of trash production, trash collection and trash disposal. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s study might help. Already the study by <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>, research director of the <ORGANIZATION> Reason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has stirred interest in the industry and among policymakers. The study points out four basic options available: 1. Waste reduction policies. 2. Recycling programs. 3. Waste-to-enery facilites that burn trash. 4. Identification and construction of additional landfills. <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> observes that other industrialized nations already produce far less trash per person than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` amply illustrating that it is possible, through altered habits, to generate less trash.'' The Japanese, <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> states, produce only 76 percent the amount of garbage generated per person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> produces even less, about 60 percent, and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> only 40 percent of American waste per person. Recycling efficiency also can be improved, according to the study, which concludes that waste hauled to landfills could be reduced 25 percent. Existing programs, however, handle less than 20 percent of waste in their communities. In fact, what is referred to as recycling sometimes is n't. Much of what it earmarked for recycling merely ends up in the disposal site after all, because in some cases the market for recycled products is depressed. Why, asked a <ORGANIZATION> Reason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, should forests be harvested when the market for recycled newsprint might be falling in price? His point: The recycling of some items might simultaneously help conserve national assets. The study states that experience with waste-to-enery facilites produces the most dramatic results, since incinerators are capable of handling up to 90 percent of the waste stream, leaving only the inert ashes for disposal. <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> recommends all four strategies, and that people be made aware of the costs involved, which sometimes are hidden in general real estate taxes; that customers be charged on a volume basis; and that competition be invited from private garbage collectors and disposal services. The study, available at no charge to community officials -LRB- 2716 <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blvd. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> 90405 -RRB-, cites <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s recycling program as a model that works, and provides specifics on costs and savings in that city

 Prices closed lower in lackluster trading on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, as the market shadowed Wall Street's narrow movements. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 12.1 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,351.4 points. Volume amounted to a light 349.5 million shares, down from 480.1 million shares Friday. Dealers estimated that about 6 points of the 100-share index's decline reflected the fact that several companies went `` ex-dividend'' Monday, including <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Lyons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> That means the deadline for buying shares to qualify for the companies' next dividend has passed.

 Wheat futures prices rose moderately Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting hope for new sales of the grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The stock market fell in listless trading today, reflecting ongoing investor caution about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Stock prices were mixed at the opening, sagged to session lows just after midday then floundered for much of the session. A late rally erased some of the day's losses. Wall Street analysts said continued economic uncertainty sent many investors to the sidelines to await fresh economic data due out later this week. Reports on retail, housing and auto sales as well as producer prices and industrial production are expected to provide further evidence of a slowing economy, analysts said. Analysts said that investors hope more data suggesting a slowdown in economic growth will prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, and thus help improve corporate profits. High-technology stocks, which have taken a hit in recent days due to an industry-wide slowdown, helped drag the market lower for another day. `` The focus is on the stocks getting hit, particularly the narrow high-tech area, and that negative sentiment has thrown a shroud over the rest of the market,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, equities analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday agreed to terminate the proposed merger of its cellular telephone interests with those of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, clearing the way for <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to buy a controlling interest in LIN for $ 3.38 billion. LIN last week asked <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> to terminate its September agreement for merging the cellular telephone operations in a non-cash deal. LIN last week recommended its shareholders approve <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s latest offer. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> said it was not prepared to wage a bidding war. `` Our merger would have created the premier cellular company in the world, but such decisions ultimately must reflect economic and strategic realities,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. New York-based LIN was expected to accept a termination settlement that would pay <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> $ 66.5 million. LIN spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Plouf </PERSON> said an agreement then would be signed to proceed with the <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> deal. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement `` clears the way for us to complete our acquisition.'' <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schosteck </PERSON>, whose Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, company follows the cellular telephone industry, said it would have been unwise for <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> to compete with <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> for LIN. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s generally conservative shareholders probably would be averse to a prolonged takeover battle, <PERSON> Schosteck </PERSON> said. `` A fight could have diluted earnings for years,'' he said. Furthermore, because it also provides regular land line telephone service, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> also was subject to certain regulatory considerations that would not apply to <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schosteck </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s fiduciary responsibilities precluded them from following this through to the end,'' he said. LIN fell $ 2 to $ 122.25 a share Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Bellsouth </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1 to $ 54.50 a share and <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> declined 75 cents to $ 38.75 a share. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, Wash.-based <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, which has sought LIN for six months, made a revised offer last week to buy a 50.1 percent controlling interest in LIN for $ 154.11 a share, or a total of $ 3.38 billion. The McCaw-LIN deal calls for <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> to buy 21.9 million shares of LIN. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, which already owns 5.1 million LIN shares, would end up with just over 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s 53.9 million common shares. The $ 66.5 million termination fee for <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> was part of the previous LIN-BellSouth agreement, in which the two firms would have created a cellular telephone company with 55 million potential customers and dominance in some of the nation's top markets. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> would have gotten 50 percent of the stock of the combined cellular company. Before the completion of the merger, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> would have spun off its television broadcasting subsidiaries to stockholders and paid each shareholder a $ 20-per-share special dividend. In its initial offer made June 6, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> proposed a buyout of all of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s stock at $ 120 a share, or a total of nearly $ 6.5 billion. LIN and <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> tried to negotiate an agreement, but after their talks broke down <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> deal. LIN's business includes cellular telephone, broadcasting and publishing. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> is the nation's largest cellular phone company. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to terminate the previous agreement also includes a provision for <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> to contribute $ 26.5 million to Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> RCC </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> owns 85 percent and <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> 15 percent. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company owns an equity interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In a related development Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's announced it had removed <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding-Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, subsidiaries of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> company, from its `` CreditWatch'' _ where they had been placed Oct. 30. S & amp; P reaffirmed its `` AAA'' ratings on senior unsecured debt for the subsidiaries in response <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from the proposed LIN cellular merger.

 <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's second largest maker of computer terminals, agreed Monday to a $ 268 million buyout by a <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> group in a deal that could boost the company's flagging business. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>, which is based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> but does all manufacturing in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and elsewhere overseas, began a search for buyers after losing $ 21 million in the 1989 fiscal year ended March 31. The $ 10-per-share buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment group of government and local enterprises, is the largest ever of a foreign firm by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` A lot of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies looked at <LOCATION> Wyse </LOCATION> but figured it was n't worth more than $ 4 or $ 5 a share,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Technology Stockletter `` <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> got the best price it could from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.'' `` The acquisition is an important step for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s electronics and computer industries to enter the world market,'' <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-fu </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest investor in the buyout, said in a news conference in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> said his group would use <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>'s sales channels and technology personnel to promote <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s high-technology products. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>, an 8-year-old company that earned $ 28 million in fiscal 1988 before slumping, holds more than a 50 percent market share for general-purpose terminals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Worldwide, <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> trails only <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a supplier of terminals, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatnik </PERSON>, an industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Terminals, which can be hooked to mainframes, minicomputers or personal computers, accounted for 47 percent of <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>'s $ 452 million in sales in fiscal 1989. Personal computers accounted for 39 percent, and screen monitors accounted for 14 percent of sales. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> is expected to sell 800,000 terminals worldwide by the end of 1989, nearly all to businesses, compared with just over 1 million by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blatnik </PERSON> said. In the first six months of fiscal 1990, ending Sept. 29, <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> had $ 231 million in revenue and net losses of $ 7.7 million. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> has been less successful in selling IBM-compatible personal computers, and <PERSON> Blatnik </PERSON> said that is the area that should get the most attention from the new Taiwanese owners. `` The whole concept of the deal has to be looked at as a positive step for <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Blatnik </PERSON> said. `` It gives them financial stability, and over the long term provides them with a better focus on the PC side of their business.'' Although <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> has a reputation for making low-priced, high-quality terminals and personal computers, its strategy in the PC market has hurt the company's growth, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> has a strategy of not producing the most advanced computers,'' he said. `` They wait to see how the latest technology shakes out and then try to move in with lower prices. That has n't worked out for them They need to be more innovative.'' <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse </PERSON> will remain with the company as vice chairman. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, former senior vice president <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> and former president of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instrument </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will become chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> has been serving as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit research and development organization established in 1973 to accelerate the development of advanced technology in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. He said he does n't plan significant near-term changes in <LOCATION> Wyse </LOCATION>'s product lines or its approach to business, and intends to maintain its headquarters, marketing and related operations in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> Taiwanese businessmen have shown growing interest in acquiring foreign firms, which they believe could boost their business in the world market. Last month, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, proposed using <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s foreign reserves of about $ 73 billion for loans to local enterprises for overseas acquisitions.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Surge, Approach New 1989 High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices surged to within a few dollars of new 1989 highs Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market extended for a fifth day its recovery from a steep post-Thanksgiving decline. On other commodity markets, orange juice futures rose sharply on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> freeze fears; cotton futures rebounded; energy futures gained; pork futures fell; cattle futures rose; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Gold futures settled $ 4.90 to $ 5.50 higher with the contract for delivery in December up $ 5 at $ 416.80 a troy ounce. The December contract reached an intra-day high of $ 418 an ounce, just $ 1.70 below the 1989 high of $ 419.70 reached on Nov. 24. Silver futures finished 4.5 cents to 4.9 cents higher with December at $ 5.692 a troy ounce. Analysts said that after climbing back steadily from about $ 401 in the past week, gold looked strong enough to break through $ 420 an ounce, an event that would likely trigger new waves of buying. Explanations for the recovery abounded but four market analysts queried by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> agreed the political changes occurring in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were in some way linked to gold's strength `` The market reads this as one of the watershed geopolitical events of the 20th century,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> noted a strong correlation between the gold market and the West German mark, which he interpreted as evidence that investors expect <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to benefit economically from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s movement away from communism <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, a director and chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, saw signs that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is preparing to issue gold-backed bonds and halt all sales of gold on the open market. Gold traders also responded to Monday's higher energy prices, typically a buy-signal for inflation-sensitive gold, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodity trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Orange juice futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for a hard freeze in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by the end of the week. Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 2.45 cents to 3.75 cents higher with January at $ 1.313 cents a pound. Cotton futures also climbed sharply in a move that analysts viewed as a technical correction after several sessions in which prices fell. Cotton settled .60 cent to 1.73 cent higher with March at 67.91 cents a pound. Heating oil continued to lead energy prices higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as extremely cold temperatures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> spurred demand for fuel oil on the world market. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 23 cents higher with January at $ 20.70 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent lower to .58 cent higher with January at 66.95 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .11 cent to .40 cent lower with January at 52.40 cents a gallon. Frozen pork bellies dropped the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit for the third straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, partly reflecting disappointment over the government's slow pace in buying bellies to donate to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Cattle futures advanced in line with strong cash markets. Hog futures were mixed.

 Wholesale home heating oil prices rose Monday as wintry weather boosted demand. Crude oil futures also closed higher but gasoline futures finished lower. The contract for No. 2 heating oil for January delivery rose 0.58 cent to 66.95 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, adding to Friday's gain of 0.90 cent Contracts for delivery during February and March ended with much smaller increases while the April contract fell slightly. Low temperatures in parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> spurred buying, analysts said. Buyers in the crude oil pit took a cue from heating oil traders and bid prices higher. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 22 cents to $ 20.70 per 42-gallon barrel after losing 3 cents on Friday. The February through April contracts ended with similar gains. Among other refined products traded on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION>, wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which sank 0.16 cent on Friday, dropped another 0.25 cent to 52.40 cents a gallon. Other contracts closed lower also. Gasoline prices typically soften in the winter when driving tapers off due to bad weather. Energy analyst <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Simard </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said buying enthusiasm in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> spilled over into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, prices of gasoil _ the equivalent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> heating oil _ have firmed because of shortages and a seasonal pickup in demand. She said there were reports Monday that a drought in parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which has caused low water levels on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has reduced production of hydroelectric power. The result has been extra demand for alternative energy sources. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> now is importing more energy than it is exporting while normally the country is a net energy exporter, <PERSON> Simard </PERSON> said, citing reports circulating in the futures markets.

 Stock prices fell in listless trading Monday amid investor uncertainty about the economy and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 3.20 points to 2,728.24 after gaining 10.66 points in Friday's session. Declining issues outpaced advances by a 5 to 4 margin in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 844 issues down, 669 up and 477 unchanged. Traders said high-technology stocks led the losers after two brokerages lowered the investment ratings of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> and Apple computer companies. Wall Street analysts attributed the market's overall weakness to investor uncertainty about the prospects for the economy and to profit-taking after Friday's modest rally. `` The word is apprehension, particularly given the sad state of profits and no apparent reason to believe that will change,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said based on last Friday's report on November employment, many economists have revised downward their fourth-quarter economic forecasts The report showed the jobless rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent in October. In addition, despite a gain of 210,000 jobs in November, October's pace of jobs growth was revised downward. `` The consensus before the report was for a growth rate of about 1.5 percent, now it's closer to 1 percent,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Analysts said many investors were noncommital ahead of a slew of new government reports due out this week which could provide a better clue about the economy's direction, among them November retail sales, producer prices, industrial production and capacity utilization. Investors hope further evidence of an economic slowdown will persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to lower interest rates and thus help boost sagging corporate profits, analysts said. Analysts said some investors also took the opportunity to do year-end housecleaning in the absence of fresh economic news to stir the market. `` It was a continuation of year-end tax selling, some for profits some reflecting negativism about former favorites with the focal point being high-tech stocks on the sell side,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, equities analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 147.13 million shares, up from 144.91 million in Friday's session Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 177.28 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market fell $ 6.221 billion, or 0.18 percent, in value from Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped 0.09 to 192.83. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pinacle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the most active stock, fell | to 10 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> dropped 4 \ to 81 | after <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> downgraded the stock's investment rating, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> lost -RCB- to 96 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 1 -LCB- to Apple Computer, the most active stock on the over-the-counter list, dropped 2 -LCB- to 39 \ after <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> lowered its investment rating and earnings estimate for the company On the plus side, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 35 -RRB-, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> gained \ to 42 -RRB- and WYSE Technology advanced | to 9 -RCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index lost 0.31 to 398.91, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index edged down 0.13 to 348.56.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Monday to sell its $ 590 million credit card portfolio because of difficulties in competing with companies that operate multibillion dollar credit card operations. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said that since the 1970s, the credit card business had grown to the point where just a few companies had amassed a large chunk of the market. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said although <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> was the 15th largest bank in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it ranked only 33rd among credit card suppliers. The bank has 675,000 <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> and VISA cardholders, located mostly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, for revenues of $ 590 million. By comparison, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, giant <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> has credit card revenues of more than $ 21 billion annually. `` We'd have to spend a lot of money to continue to compete in this field,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We came to the point where we decided to put our resources elsewhere.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the bank would concentrate on expanding its branch network throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and on broadening its range of consumer finance products, such as home equity, residential mortgages and student loans.

 After four years of disagreements, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> announced on Monday that it has reached an accord with <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, raising the prospect of financial aid if Peruvian policies meet its approval. An official of the fund, who spoke on condition he not be named, said <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> had made a payment of $ 42.3 million on the $ 800 million it owes the fund. The payment covers only the arrears since September of this year. The agreement was reached last week between <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s negotiator, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the fund's French managing director, the official said. Owned by 152 governments, the fund negotiates at length with governments in financial trouble. It gives its help only when the borrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves. Usually these include cuts in government spending, especially on official payrolls and subsidies, and often a devaluation of the country's currency. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has been in trouble with the financial world since President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was elected in 1985 and announced that he would make only partial payments of interest on the country's debts At that time <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> owed $ 14 billion abroad. Now the figure is closer to $ 20 billion. Its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuing rebellion of a leftist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, and a thriving traffic in drugs. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of $ 3.5 billion to the fund, and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it _ or much from anyone else. This year the fund started a series of what it called `` shadow programs,'' under which governments promised new policies but got no immediate money. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and now <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> have started such programs. If the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so, they will start getting its financial help.

<HEAD>Labor Department Orders Eastern Compliance on Health Benefits</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it has obtained an order requiring <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to help striking and laid-off employees obtain continued health benefits. `` Employers must know that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is serious about protecting the right of working Americans to continued health coverage in cases like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> concerning <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. The consent order, which requires Eastern to report on its compliance quarterly for five years, followed an investigation by Labor officials into complaints by Eastern COBRA participants who said insurance carriers told them they were no longer covered, even though the employees had paid insurance premiums. The federal law says employers must give terminated employees the chance to obtain continued health benefits at group rates. `` As a result -LRB- officials -RRB- began a large-scale investigation into possible violations of notification and insurance claims processing provisions under COBRA,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, assistant Labor Secretary. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, senior general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union that's been on strike since March 4, said employees were inappropriately rejected on claims or faced backlogs of up to six months. `` We've been having a running battle with Eastern on the COBRA violations,'' Haber said. <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said just before the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> laid off most of its workers in the insurance department, which contributed to the backlog. <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said employees have had better results recently. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said claims were taking an average of four weeks to process. He said the consent order would have no financial impact on Eastern. `` We're up-to-date now,'' he said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> blamed initial problems on a combination of hostile union-management relations, the complications of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization Eastern filed for March 9, and the massive number of employees suddenly on strike o laid off. Also, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had computer problems that exacerbated the delays. `` We feel that we really reacted admirably in the unusual circumstances,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` The COBRA law never contemplated such wide-ranging and massive problems.'' Eastern has been operating as a much smaller airline because of the strike and bankruptcy reorganization. It reportedly is close to selling Latin American routes to <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 300 million to $ 400 million. Neither Fort Worth-based AMR nor Eastern would discuss the deal, reported in several newspapers. But there was speculation a deal could be announced by Wednesday, when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to meet with a committee of creditors. The negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> on the Latin American routes are the second round since <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sought Chapter 11 protection. Earlier attempts to sell the routes to <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> foundered over disagreements involving a lawsuit filed against American by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the other main <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. During the strike American, the nation's largest airline, has been expanding aggressively in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> _ a key area for Eastern.

<TEXT>
 H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 14.1 percent increase in second-quarter earnings Monday, helped by stronger sales and higher prices for its food products. Earnings for the Pittsburgh-based food manufacturer totaled $ 125 million in the period ending Nov. 1, or 47 cents per share, vs. $ 109.9 million, or 42 cents per share a year earlier. The per-share figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in September. Sales during the second quarter amounted to $ 1.5 billion, up 7.5 percent from $ 1.4 billion in 1988. The gain resulted from higher volume of tuna, frozen potatoes and Weight Watchers frozen meals, as well as price increases. For the first six months of 1989, net income was $ 251.9 million or 95 cents a share, up 14.5 percent from last year's $ 219.9 million or 84 cents a share a year earlier. Sales for the first half of 1989 increased to $ 2.9 billion, up 6.4 percent from last year's $ 2.8 billion.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to invoke sanctions against bigger rivals <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for what it called `` predatory pricing'' by their company-owned bottling plants. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that the company has asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> for sanctions against the two. Royal Crown has requested that <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> be prohibited from acquiring additional holdings in their franchise systems, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> disclosed at a beverage industry gathering in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In addition, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> should order the two companies to divest their interests in company-owned bottling plants and the brands other than <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> produced by those operations. Under the request, Royal Crown has asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to require that the two companies each reduce their holdings in company-owned plants to 25 percent within two years _ at which time they would be sold. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> declined comment, saying it was unaware of any <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the issue, said spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, said it has n't been contacted on the matter by the federal agency or Royal Crown. `` There's really nothing new here and certainly nothing the industry has n't heard before,'' said <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company's <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> operations. Royal Crown's appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> is the second time in three years the company has filed complaints with the agency against <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986, Royal Crown asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to block <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s planned buyout of Dr Pepper, claiming the purchases would violate federal antitrust laws The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> later blocked the acquisitions on antitrust grounds. Royal Crown, based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is in turn controlled by industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. In his talk, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> called predatory pricing the most serious problem facing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft drink industry. Predatory pricing consists of pricing products below cost to beat competitors, then quickly hiking them back up after the action has succeeded. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> charged, for example, that it costs bottlers about 80 cents to put a two-liter bottle in a supermarket, but <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> both sold the bottles for 69 cents each last Labor Day weekend in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> has 41.1 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft drink market, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> with 31.1 percent. Royal Crown has only 2.8 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, an industry publication.

 Banks and foreign exchange houses were closed Monday to give them time to digest the government-ordered 34.5 percent currency devaluation, along with the postponement of payments on the nation's massive internal debt. Initial reaction was mixed over the plan, which was the second severe economic adjustment in five months. Spokesmen for organized labor criticized it while many businessmen said the changes were necessary to stabilize the economy. Both sides expected rates to be increased for electricity, transportation and other public services, which along with the devaluation was expected to acclerate inflation. Economy Minister <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> said Monday night in a speech broadcast nationwide that an increase in inflation would be `` transitory,'' and that the government's program of deregulation and privatization would continue. <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> blamed the need for the new measures on `` speculative maneuvers'' that put pressure on the exchange rate. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported late Monday that the prices of many consumer items that had been regulated _ including stereos, washing machines, clothing, shoes, fresh chicken, coffee _ would be freed. However, about a dozen basic commodities _ including cooking oil, rice, pasta, bread and tea _ would be subject to controls that set maximum prices. Shortly before midnight Sunday, the government devalued the austral to 1,000 per <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar from the previous rate of 655-to-1, bringing the austral in line with its black market value. State-controlled gasoline prices were boosted by about 60 percent, bringing the price of a gallon of regular gas to the equivalent of $ 1.44. To help Argentines cope with the measures, the government authorized monthly pay increases for December of $ 30 to public employees and $ 24 for private sector employees. Unions which already had been staging pay strikes said the raises were not enough. Commuter train lines were halted by stoppages Monday and court clerks pledged to renew their boycott that disrupted the judicial system nationwide last week. `` This adjustment plan does not help the interests of workers,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereyra </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, the 3 million-member coalition that includes most every Argentine union. <PERSON> Livio </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhl </PERSON>, a spokesmen for business leaders who met with President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> just before the measures were announced, said they supported the changes along with <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s plans to privatize and deregulate <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economy. The measures _ particularly the pay increases and the devaluation _ almost certainly will stoke inflation that has grown at triple-digit rates in 14 of the past 15 years. The last economic adjustment, on July 9, devalued the austral by 54 percent, hiked public service rates by 200 percent and more, and imposed wage and price guidelines. That helped bring monthly inflation down to 5.6 percent in October from 197 percent in July, but fueled labor unrest because real wages did not keep pace with price hikes. The November inflation rate was 6.5 percent, higher than the previous month for the first time since <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> took office on July 8. The December rate will be double-digit, independent analysts projected. The price of a kilogram of beef, or 2.2 pounds, soared by 40 percent Monday to the equivalent of 54 cents. In an effort to curtail a flow of australs into the economy, which would renew downward pressure on the exchange rate if Argentines chose to buy dollars, the government announced Sunday it would delay the payment of state-issued bonds by two years. The government's internal debt is estimated at $ 7 billion, or about 10 percent of the gross national product. About $ 650 million was due to be paid by March 1. Interest will continue to be paid, the <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Proponent Resigns as Columbia Savings Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The troubled junk bond market claimed the job of one of its biggest supporters Monday when <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said he would quit as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the year. Under the leadership of <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, a former Wall Street trader, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> invested more heavily than any other thrift in high-yield, high-risk bonds, turning big profits on them until recently. But new federal laws forced <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to essentially return to being a conventional mortgage lender. The thrift in October marked down the price of its junk bonds to reflect their depressed market value, as required by new federal law, taking a loss of about $ 350 million. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell the junk bonds to a new subsidiary. Previously, thrifts did n't have to adjust the book value of their bonds to account for market price because they carried them as long-term investments. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield portfolio is now worth $ 3.8 billion, down from $ 4.3 billion at the end of last year, and <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the thrift urgently needed to rid itself of the bonds. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said he would work full time as a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, trying to line up investors for the subsidiary into which the junk bonds would be spun off. A thrift bailout bill signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in August requires thrifts to sell their junk bonds by 1994. Under the legislation, thrifts can invest in junk bonds only through separately capitalized affiliates rather than using government-insured deposits. `` Business imperatives coupled with the publicity surrounding me led me to conclude that a new CEO with extensive banking or thrift experience was required to lead <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> into the future,'' <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said it already had begun interviewing potential successors. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> is a friend of junk bond pioneer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who has been indicted on racketeering and securities fraud charges. New charges against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> reportedly will include allegations of illegal stock and bond deals with <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> was unavailable for an interview, but <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said he intended to hold the bonds to maturity in the new <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. She said it was too early to describe in detail how the subsidiary would work. `` Hopefully the structure we're considering would have the effect of removing the volatility that's in the high-yield market,'' she said. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said in his statement that the depressed market for junk bonds had created big opportunities. `` During the eight years in which I have been actively involved in the high-yield securities market, I have never seen better values,'' he said. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, 43, noted that his family owns more than half of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock. `` I believe that it is urgent that I move rapidly to preserve and enhance the value of our securities portfolio,'' he said. Fueled largely by <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>'s investments in junk bonds, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s assets jumped to $ 13 billion this year from $ 400 million in 1974. But in the third quarter of this year <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 226 million as a result of $ 357.5 million in losses related to those bond holdings. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said that because of problems with junk bond investments it will be unable to meet the tougher requirements for risk-based capital under the savings and loan bailout law. In order to boost its capital, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell nearly all its mortgage-backed securities for about $ 90 million, and to sell `` certain public and private equities'' for a gain of about $ 75 million, the thrift said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said it has raised $ 10 million more through various asset sales and other actions. Thrift institutions like <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> that do not meet the new capital requirements are required to file a capital plan acceptable to federal regulators by Jan. 8. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said its plan will, as required, detail its financial strategy for compliance, but the thrift provided no details. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> was paid $ 5.6 million in 1987 and $ 4.1 million last year. Ms. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said his pay package as a consultant has not been determined, and she declined to estimate how much he will make this year. His high salaries have angered federal thrift regulators for years, as has his amassing of the huge portfolio of junk bonds. He also is known for his close ties to political figures. He set up the junk bond investment for former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> that forced the Democrat to resign last May.
