 Police arrested 12 men, including an opposition party leader, in foiling a plot to overthrow the government and assassinate President <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, Information Minister <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowier </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bowier </PERSON> told a news conference seven plotters were still at large, including an army captain and two sergeants. He said those arrested included <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kpolleh </PERSON>, leader of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Liberia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, party lawyer <PERSON> Cephar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbandi </PERSON> and four soldiers,. The minister said the plot was uncovered on March 16. He said it was a conspiracy `` to destabilize the government, create internal strife and overthrow the government by assassinating the president of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bowier </PERSON> said arms, ammunition and military uniforms were found in a building in the <LOCATION> Sinkor </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>. Investigations continued but the situation was under control, he said. Bowier read from a prepared statement and declined to answer questions. Journalists were warned not to run editorial comments or cartoons on the plot before the defendants go on trial. The minister gave no court date. The Unification party on Monday released a statement expressing concern over the arrests of <LOCATION> Kpolleh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mbandi </LOCATION>. It said several properties owned by <PERSON> Kpolleh </PERSON> and his family were destroyed during investigations by security forces and that his wife narrowly escaped being raped. It did not elaborate. <PERSON> Bowier </PERSON> advised reporters not to believe any press releases issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, saying it was banned and its statements had no credibility. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, who came to power in a bloody April 1980 coup, has been the target of several assassination attempts. An attempted coup on Nov. 12, 1985, resulted in more than 600 deaths and the destruction of the village of the ringleader, former Brig. <PERSON> Gen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiwonkpa </PERSON>, who was killed in the attempt. <PERSON> Quiwonkpa </PERSON>, who had been living in exile, led the attempt following elections that opposition leaders and independent observers said were rigged. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest republic, was founded in 1847 by freed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> slaves. Descendents of the slaves, who were a minority, controlled the government until <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, from the <ORGANIZATION> Krahn </ORGANIZATION> ethnic group, stormed the presidential mansion in April 1980, killing then-President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>. The economy declined under the rule of the former army master sergeant. Major Western creditors suspended aid to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> pending payment of debts. Last year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent 17 financial experts to <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION> to oversee operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought Tuesday to revive his stalled effort to aid the Nicaraguan Contras and said congressional Democrats will be to blame if the supply-starved rebels fade from existence. In an hour-long meeting on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to unite behind a new effort to push through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> some kind of help for the Contras, whose last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid ran out Feb. 29. Later, speaking at a fund-raising reception for the re-election campaign of Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., the president, as he has before, linked last week's incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by troops of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government to the defeat of his request for funds for the rebels `` The logistical preparation for the incursion began just after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to reject our package of aid to the democratic resistance,'' he said. `` This was a precise and carefully planned operation that showed the influence of outside advisers and must have required several weeks to plan.'' Rebel supporters said their chances of prevailing on the divisive issue were improved by the incursion, which was making some moderates nervous about leaving the rebels without aid. `` Some were quite pale in their appearance when they realized there was this incursion,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Miss </LOCATION>., the chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vote counter `` We think there is some potential there to get a few more votes than we had in the past.'' One member of the `` swing'' group, Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said he was preparing a compromise aid package and was seeking the support of other moderates `` All we are trying to say is that leaving the situation as it is, is unacceptable,'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said. `` We are determined to get continued assistance to the resistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the closed meeting with lawmakers, according to a text of his remarks provided by the White House. He declined to offer details on what kind of package he was asking for. Alluding to Democratic efforts to thwart any military aid for the Contras, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added: `` Those who led the fight against our package of assistance to the democratic resistance can not escape responsibility'' if the rebel forces wither. Later, in a session with local-government <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> officials, the president again pointed the finger of blame at <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, who played hardball to win the vote to cut off aid, now says it wo n't accept responsibility for the destruction of the freedom fighters. But if the freedom fighters are extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be the ones to decide who is responsible,'' he contended. Democrats immediately tossed the blame back, insisting that it was Republicans who were responsible for the narrow <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defeat of a package of strictly `` humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing, medicine and shelter _ on March 3. `` What we're seeing is a public relations campaign here,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` The Republicans are very nervous about it because the finger's pointed right at them. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, renewed his offer to vote quickly on a package of purely humanitarian aid if Republicans will ask for discussions. But he said any proposal containing military equipment would be subject to normal committee review. `` The door is open, the welcome mat is laid,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The continued wrangling seemed to make the rebels themselves despair of any quick action to renew the money flow, and they released a television advertisement to begin airing this week that makes a direct appeal to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewers for contributions. `` Your <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> abandoned us,'' <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist for the rebels, says somberly in the spot. `` We have nowhere to turn but to individual Americans like you.'' The spot, which asks for money for `` medicine, blankets and food for our families and children,'' was to begin running this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s home town. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC News poll of 1,007 Americans found that 55 percent of those surveyed opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dispatch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops last week to train in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and 62 percent thought the troops would become involved in the fighting. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll, conducted by telephone interviews Thursday through Monday, found that 40 percent of those surveyed favored aid to the Contras and 56 percent opposed it. It was the highest support figure since the 43 percent level recorded on July 15, 1987, the day after former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The White House has encouraged a bipartisan group of Contra supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> who are proposing a one-year, $ 48 million package of non-lethal aid that also would give the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> the right to deliver previously stockpiled weapons. Under that plan, the president also would have the right to get a quick vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on sending new military aid under certain conditions. MacKay's version, still being drafted, would contain a compromise on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s future ability to demand a quick vote. In contrast with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>'s would let the president trigger an expedited vote, but would not let him dictate the kind of aid package to be voted on. That would be left to normal legislative procedures, he said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> visit that the administration has not yet aligned itself with any specific bill, but would like to have a package introduced soon and a vote before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves next week on an Easter recess. `` We'd like to have a vote before then,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But House Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said it would be difficult to bring the matter to a vote before the week of April 11, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns to session.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> spoke Tuesday of the slow pace of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, but cautioned that lack of quick movement does not mean a stalemate. Negotiators at the U.N.-sponsored talks apparently were waiting for new signals from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> met with the Afghan delegation for less than 30 minutes Tuesday and with the Pakistani team, which speaks for the Afghan guerrillas, for more than an hour. He later spoke briefly to reporters, admitting that there was `` very slow progress'' but that it `` should not be confused with a deadlock.'' There was a short-lived rumor that the Afghans, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, were preparing to leave <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Wednesday. But a Pakistani negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the talks would proceed on schedule. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said earlier there was no reason for suspending the talks. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief representative, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, has said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was prepared to stay in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` as long as it takes'' to conclude a peace settlement. The talks are stalling over the question of what <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> government should oversee implementation of the settlement and over future Soviet military aid to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> assistance cease at the same time as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the anti-Marxist guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has rejected this as interference in relations between two sovereign states. `` Attention now centers on the discussions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' a Pakistani source said. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said last week that the superpowers may `` at least find it easier to settle among themselves'' the aid issue. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened militarily in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the end of 1979 to support the government in its fight against the Islamic guerrillas. Approximately 115,000 Soviet troops are still there. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says he wants to withdraw the Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> this year if agreement can be reached at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A military prosecutor on Tuesday jailed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Herreros </PERSON>, director of the leftist magazine <ORGANIZATION> Cauce </ORGANIZATION>, for purportedly defaming <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s armed forces in an editorial, a magazine spokesman reported. <PERSON> Herreros </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s main prison after being questioned by prosecutor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Cauce </ORGANIZATION> editor. Under <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government, the armed forces codes empower prosecutors to indict and jail civilians brought before military courts. The editorial written by <PERSON> Herreros </PERSON> and published by Cauce in June 1987 criticized the influence given to the military courts in recent years. According to lawyers and human rights activists, more than 90 percent of those tried by military courts in the last five years were civilians, including a number of journalists. <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> has five days to file formal charges against <PERSON> Herreros </PERSON> or release him, according to the military code. The suit against <PERSON> Herreros </PERSON> was started by the army. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has been ruled by the armed forces since a coup ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in September 1973.

<TEXT>
 The Army successfully test-fired five <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles slated to be banned from deployment under a treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, does not require either side to withdraw or destroy missiles until it has been ratified by both governments. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve the pact in late spring. The unarmed missiles were successfully fired Monday under battlefield conditions, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. The Pershing is a field missile _ each of which costs $ 4 million _ launched from its own assembly that can be carried by a truck. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, calls for the destruction of all missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, predicting its biggest season win yet, continues to add potentially successful new series to its schedule, while <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, facing its first last-place ratings finish ever, ca n't get its new comedies arrested <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> fared best with new fare last week, adding the critically praised nostalgia comedy `` The Wonder Years'' to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> top 10. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot for `` In the Heat of the Night'' tied for 15th in the rankings, though it remains to be seen how the series will do on a weekly basis. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, failed with its attempt to add new comedies to its Monday and Tuesday nights. The best performer was `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>,'' which ranked 31st. For the week that ended Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average, prime-time rating of 15.8; CBS 12.9 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.6. With four weeks left in the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads with a 16.3, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.9 and CBS 13.6. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> would have to beat <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> by two points a week to tie for second. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has never finished a season in third place in the 35 years that <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> has done television ratings. The `` CBS Evening News,'' however, was still in first place, with an average rating of 11.6. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had a 10.8 and `` NBC Nightly News'' 9.7. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. Here is last week's top 10: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Wonder Years'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Night Court'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Murder, She Wrote'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and `` Growing Pains'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Half of the top 10 shows were repeats, as the networks, faced with a strike by scriptwriters, began to conserve new episodes for the May sweeps. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> added `` Eisenhower & amp; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>'' to its Monday night lineup, moving `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' to Tuesday, where the rest of the lineup dragged that critically acclaimed series down to 65th of 77 rankings. The other new comedies CBS tried on Tuesday were steamrollered by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s normally strong lineup, including `` The Wonder Years.'' It replaced `` Growing Pains,'' which moved to Wednesday night where it continues to be a top-10 show. CBS' `` Coming of Age,'' starring <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> as an acerbic former airline pilot struggling to adjust to a sunny retirement village, was 59th. At a dismal 75th was `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' a formerly high-rated comedy reprised by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> to fill in for the new `` The Dictator,'' which was delayed by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> strike. `` Trial and Error,'' a Hispanic `` Odd Couple,'' was 76th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did well with a TV version of the classic film `` Inherit the Wind,'' starring <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. It ranked 14th. `` In the Heat of the Night'' was a pilot for a potential fall series starring <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> in a remake of the hit movie.

 The destruction of millions of acres of tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a problem for the developed nations as well as the Third World and requires economic and educational solutions, say scientists at a leading plant research institution. The Missouri Botanical Garden, known for its man-made tropical atmosphere in the so-called `` Climatron'' designed by <PERSON> Buckminster </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, is working to halt the decimation of the world's real tropical jungles. `` The outlook is pretty grim,'' said biologist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, director of the garden. `` Although tropical forests once covered at least 12 percent of the globe _ an area about twice the size of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ they have already been reduced to about half that.'' `` Currently, the forests are being cleared or degraded at the rate of about 60 million acres a year. That's an area about half the size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said roughly half of all known plant and animal species on Earth are found in the tropical forests. At the current rate of destruction, as many as 60,000 species of plants will be extinct by the year 2020. `` The plant-rich tropics supply man with a wealth of food crops, medicines and other useful products,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Forero </PERSON>, director of research at the garden. `` But they are being destroyed rapidly.'' The chief culprits, <PERSON> Forero </PERSON> said, are loggers and slash-and-burn peasant farmers. The loggers obviously need the trees to stay in business and the farmers often have to destroy the forests to feed themselves and their families. And the scientists say the situation can only get worse unless something is done to stop it. `` At present, over half the people in the world live in countries that are at least partly tropical, excluding <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Forero </PERSON> said. `` Nearly a third of these people are already living in extreme poverty and with current rates of growth, the human population of these countries will double in less than 30 years.'' `` How can you tell these starving people that you are going to save the very things they have to destroy in order to sustain their already meager existence,'' asked <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>. `` Education and political and economic stability are obviously the keys. That and understanding.'' Which is why, <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said, the garden has committed itself to an all-out effort to explore, document and save the forests. With a staff of 70 researchers and technicians, including many who live permanently in the tropics, the garden makes up one of the world's largest active field research programs in tropical botany. The goals, the scientists said, are to collect the plant species before they become extinct and to teach the impoverished farmers how to live in the forest without destroying it. With the growing knowledge of genetics, they said, it is important that the genes, the biological blueprints, of the endangered species be saved. `` To lose this genetic capital through massive extinctions just as we are developing our capabilities to explore its potential would indeed be a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` The developments in genetics make the specter of extinction even worse,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` For each species of plant or animal lost to extinction, you're losing the potential for another 20,000 to 30,000 variants in the future. Many of the plants, scientists say, could almost certainly be developed into cheaper, easy-to-grow sources of highly nutritious food. Others could be converted into abundant sources of new medicines. Another important part of the garden's program is to lend technical assistance to and train scientists from developing tropical countries through cooperative agreements. `` Unfortunately, only 6 percent of the scientists working on the problem live in the countries involved,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` We must change that. Momentum to implement the innovative conservation and development strategies needed to deal with these urgent problems ultimately must come from the affected countries themselves,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. The backbone of the garden's research, the scientists said, is its herbarium, or plant collection. Along with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Botanical </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> herbarium is one of the three largest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and among the 12 largest in the world. Started by garden founder <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> in the 1850s, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> herbarium now contains samples of more than 3.5 million species and is expected to expand to 4.5 million within the next decade. Pointing to a large map showing the locations of the garden's researchers in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said of the encroachment on the forests: `` It wo n't be stopped soon `` But there are encouraging signs. What people have to learn is that conservation and development are really two sides of the same coin.'' `` Producers and consumers have to learn that they have a common problem. It can all be done, but it wo n't be easy.''

 An old generation is remembering the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war and a new generation is curious, stirring a revival of the controversial era in books and movies. Now comes a new publication, a slick magazine simply named <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, whose premiere issue went on sale today. `` Our timing could not have been better because right now, look at all the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> movies that have come out,'' said publisher <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the magazine is published by <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Look at all the major emphasis now on video, on books. It's <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Everyone now is talking about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON> said 150,000 copies of the first issue were printed, including 50,000 for subscribers and 100,000 for newsstand sales across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in 16 other countries. The magazine, a quarterly, sells for $ 2.95 a copy on newsstands and for $ 9.95 for the four issues by subscription. <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON> said the response has been so overwhelming from wholesalers, subscribers and the media that the magazine will probably go to six issues a year in 1989. Many of the subscribers are <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, a large number of them in prison. `` I've gotten hundreds of letters from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in prison,'' said <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON>. `` They're so happy to hear that a magazine is coming out.'' Each issue will run 68 pages with a regular format of four feature stories and six departments including editorial, fighting forces, bases and installations, arsenal and book reviews. The initial issue includes an interview with Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyand </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last military commander in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and a story on <ORGANIZATION> Tan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nhut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the command center for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> which was called the `` Pentagon East.'' It also includes 32 pages of color photographs and maps. The cover shows two soldiers defending their post with a machine gun. In the editorial in the premiere issue, the editor, retired Col. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, explains the goal of the magazine: `` Thirty-eight years after <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> began, 15 years after the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces there, and 13 years after the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, the war there truly remains an enigma. The goal we here at <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> magazine have set for ourselves is to find the key to unlock that enigma.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said that in visits to colleges he has found great interest in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> among young people who want to know what really happened there. He said there seems to be a misunderstanding of the war especially among this generation, many of whom were not even born when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers were pouring into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1965. `` There is the perception that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was defeated by a guerrilla army,'' he said. `` That's not true. The American military withdrew from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> 2 -LCB- years before the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. The North Vietnamese did not defeat the American military when they seized <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> for a very simple reason: There was no American military there to defeat. One of our objectives is to refute some of the myths.'' Summers, 56, is widely known and respected as an authority on military affairs. He served in both the Korean and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wars. He is a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, a contributing editor for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, and the author of two books, including the widely acclaimed `` On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War. The magazine's editorial review board includes Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, former commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and authors <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoli </PERSON>, both of whom have written books on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Asked if the presence of <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> and other former <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> officers on the board will leave the impression that the magazine will give only the official view, one that was often discredited during the war, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said: `` We've tried to get the voices as diverse as possible. I do n't think <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnow </PERSON>'s an apologist for the war I do n't think I'm an apologist for the war Certainly my book was very critical of the war. And so was <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoli </PERSON>.''

 <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Midgette </PERSON> bends and removes spikes from railroad ties, and <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Korthals </PERSON> blows smoke through a scale-model hog house. They are among 3,000 scientists, administrators and graduate assistants on staff at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experiment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, which celebrated its 100th anniversary Monday. But the center, one of 66 in the country, is about more than agriculture. `` I've yet to see one person ... who did n't think there were exciting things going on here,'' said station director <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>. `` One thing is clear _ research is crucial to the future of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture and our society in general.'' In one laboratory, <PERSON> Midgette </PERSON> compared the strength of railroad ties made from different woods, looking for the longest-lasting material. An African oak was so hard that it caused a bolt to break in a machine that measures the force required to pull out a spike. `` It snapped and went straight up,'' said <PERSON> Midgette </PERSON>, who figures this African oak will out-last conventional ties. `` We've got indentations in the ceiling.'' Korthals pumped smoke into the clear plastic model of a hog house to demonstrate how the air moves through the building with various ventilation systems. He said it should help farmers select the most efficient design for their own swine buildings. The 320 research projects funded by the station last year involved subjects such as agricultural economics, veterinary medicine, home economics and food science. The center has a $ 25 million budget from state and federal appropriations, as well as gifts, grants and contracts, many from the private sector, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said. It began in the Morrow Plots, site of the longest-running continuous corn experiment in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. The test plots were created in 1876, the year Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> and 264 cavalrymen were killed at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bighorn </LOCATION>. Much of the station's research still is aimed directly at production agriculture. Visitors on Monday saw a rainfall simulator used to study the effects of soil erosion, experiments on the biological control of insects, and research into the possible use of wild soybeans to improve commercial varieties. They also saw work being done to create new human foods from soybeans, to study tree growth and to learn more about infant nutrition and child development.

 The murderous rampages that left five people dead at two <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> funerals last week have aroused fears that <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is sliding into a new cycle of violence after several years of relative calm. In the past month, 15 people have died _ twice the 1987 monthly average. The dead include three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas gunned down in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on March 6 in the incident that touched off the latest mayhem in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. `` A firm grip will be required to halt the slide of the province toward still further bloodshed and anarchy,'' the News Letter, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> newspaper, warned Monday. `` There is no time to lose,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. `` If there is a political vacuum _ and there is _ the initiative will always seem to be with the paramilitaries.'' `` There wo n't be anarchy and there wo n't even be a return to the level of violence in the early 1970s when 700 people died in a year,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bew </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, said in an interview `` But the graph is starting to go up, up, up,'' he said. With police talking of about 30 suspects in Saturday's violence, Roman Catholic areas of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> are bracing for a wave of arrests that could provoke further clashes. Ever since the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s struggle to drive <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> climaxed with the death of 10 hunger striking prisoners in 1981, the province seemed to be lapsing into relative calm. The death toll was dropping steadily and there even were signs of economic rejuvenation. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, having narrowly failed to assassinate Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> with a bomb in 1984, was suffering repeated military and political setbacks. The Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985, which gave <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> a say in the running of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was bolstering <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> moderates against <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> radicals. The killing of the three guerrillas, allegedly as they were plotting a car bombing in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, was portrayed by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a triumph for its anti-terrorism strategy. But the fact that the guerrillas were unarmed outraged many Catholics as well as the Irish government. That reaction in turn angered many Protestants, who believed that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> got what it deserved. As the three were being buried, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> emerged from behind a tombstone lobbing grenades and firing into the mourners. Three died and 68 were wounded. Three days later, at the funeral of one of the cemetery victims, a car sped toward the cortege. The mourners, keyed up and fearful of another <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> attack, pounced on it. When they realized the occupants were two British soldiers, they dragged them out, beat them with iron bars and stripped them. The two men were then hauled away and shot dead by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. The two episodes revealed the hatred that can still erupt from a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority that regards itself as being under siege, and from a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority for whom <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> proves there is no British justice in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The incidents all but obscured four other deaths since <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>: a policeman, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> man and two civilians _ a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> woman and a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man. In the context of a conflict that has claimed 2,638 lives since 1969, those four would be regarded as par for Ulster's grisly course. The funeral deaths, however, were graphically captured by TV cameras, and they stunned and disgusted <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> and British citizens alike. `` Scum of the earth,'' stormed the Sun, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> daily. In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> lamented: `` This was the shocking face of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'88.'' Many Catholics reacted to Saturday's killings with shock and disgust, making no attempt to excuse them as a response to the previous cemetery bloodbath. The Irish News, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> daily, called it `` a satanic rejection of the Christian faith.'' `` The initial reaction is shock that something so barbarous could happen,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s moderate, mainstream Catholic party.

Today, the 65-year-old outspoken creator and executive producer of `` 60 Minutes'' is looking beyond current television technology, foreseeing a time when networks are superfluous and television news is beamed directly into subscribers' homes. <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> began his career as associate director and later producer of the network's first television newscast, `` <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> With the News'' and later the `` CBS Evening News'' with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>. He remembers covering the coronation of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON> and flying back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aboard a chartered airliner editing the kinescope that viewers would see on the news _ no videotapes, no satellite transmissions. `` I did n't think there was ever going to be satellites, bounce signals off a star, are you crazy?,'' he said, laughing. But <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, who considered buying <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> a few years ago, thinks it's feasible to one day broadcast news directly to homes News services already are beaming footage to local television stations, so <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>'s idea is not so far-fetched. `` I think that the network news departments, they might not even work for a network 10 years from now,'' he said. `` There might not be any networks because it may be an outmoded delivery system. `` I'm not sure you do n't have a large newsroom somewhere and you just have direct broadcast ... feeding news into people's homes, for a price same way they pay for a newspaper.'' He also foresees delivering newspapers into home printers by satellite. `` I think about it more than most people, as you can see. And I wonder how long the networks in their present form will be around,'' he said. Some other samples of <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>'s opinions: _ `` 60 Minutes'': `` I've always said all we do in this broadcast is shine lights on people in dark corners, and if people in dark corners are doing things they should n't be doing, all we did was turn the light on.'' _ The importance of pictures on television: `` The accepted wisdom in television was always you put words to pictures I do n't believe that. You put pictures to words. You start with the words. The audio is always more important to me than the video.'' _ Televised presidential debates -LRB- <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> produced the famous 1960 meeting of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> -RRB-: `` It's still a terrible format and we should n't be doing them They should have real debates. ... The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate should head up a team of two or three debaters who are really good and can really cross-examine the other side and give them a hard time, and they ought to do it in front of a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and it will produce something other than this sterile show where what it is is a joint press conference, not really a debate.'' _ This year's election: `` I do n't think there's enough caffeine in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to keep the electorate awake during a Dukakis-Bush campaign. _ Politicians: `` I do n't put politicians on the air if I can help it, because I instinctively do n't believe them I believe they're only interested in getting themselves elected, and they only say what they think will get themselves elected. _ Ratings: `` No matter what I think about ratings, and whether they're accurate and everything, I do n't say anything because they've been awfully good to me. _ The future: `` I know where I'll be in nine years I'm going to be here. My contract is n't up until I'm 74. Ironclad, nobody gets out. Now the question is, will there be a CBS? I think so. Some form. Maybe not this form.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Considering Major Child Abuse Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether abused children should have the right to sue public officials for failing to protect them from their parents. But the justices have decided to avoid another children's rights issue: whether public school students enjoy any constitutional protection against paddling or other corporal punishment by teachers and administrators. The court announced Monday that it will tackle the parental abuse issue in the case of a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> boy, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>, who suffered serious and permanent brain damage from beatings by his father. The boy's suit accuses social workers and officials of gross negligence in ignoring evidence that he was being brutally victimized. A lower court threw out the suit. A high court ruling is not expected until 1989 on whether to revive the suit against the <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and two of its employees. The agency was accused of violating the rights of <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> by failing to rescue him from his father's beatings, even though it allegedly had known about the abuse since 1983, when the child was 4 years old. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> has been institutionalized since 1984, suffering from injuries that destroyed half his brain and left him profoundly retarded. The boy's father, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>, since has been convicted of child abuse and sentenced to two to four years in prison. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>'s ex-wife, Melody, sued the social services officials on grounds they violated the child's constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process. Mrs. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON> was divorced from her husband and living in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, when she was informed her son had suffered serious brain damage. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON> had custody of his son. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in throwing out Mrs. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>'s suit, said the social welfare agency and its employees `` though blameworthy, did not cause <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s injuries'' but `` merely failed to protect him from his bestial father.'' The appeals court also said welfare agencies should not be placed in the predicament of removing a child from home and facing suit by the parent or leaving the child there and risk being sued by the child. Putting officials in that position `` is unlikely to improve the welfare of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families and is not grounded in constitutional text or principle,'' the appeals court said. In the paddling case, the court, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case that `` at some degree of excessiveness or cruelty'' such punishment violates constitutional rights. Another appeals court has rejected that view, clouding the picture. The high court in 1977 ruled that such disciplinary measures never can amount to the `` cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment. The decision barred students from suing teachers and school administrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendment violations, but left them free to sue in state courts under state laws. In the 1977 decision, however, the court said it had not considered whether corporal punishment can violate `` substantive rights under the -LRB- 14th Amendment's -RRB- due process clause.'' The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April cleared the way for a trial in <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s federal lawsuit against Penasco, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, school officials over two paddlings she received in elementary school. The appeals court said the kind of punishment alleged in the lawsuit can sustain a federal lawsuit even if a lawsuit could have been filed in state court. In other developments, the court: _ Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to promote competitive bidding on government contracts At issue is the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power. _ Agreed to decide in a case from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> whether states may impose sales taxes on most books, newspapers and magazines while exempting religious publications

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Did Thomas Jefferson Invent The News Leak?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As a capital institution, leaking confidential information to the press has a rich heritage and long roots. Those roots may be longer than one might think. The news leak, in fact, may stretch back to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, or at least his political allies. That possibility was made clear last week as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was reminded that the day marked the 188th anniversary _ March 18, 1800 _ of the issuing of the very first contempt of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> citation. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, was cited for contempt for having failed to appear as ordered to explain how he had obtained the text of a controversial but secret <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and caused it to be published. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in that era still met in secret and all of its deliberations were held to be private, not public, matters. According to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> historians, the secret bill was the product of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Federalist majority and concerned a bid to change the method of settling disputes over presidential electors <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> was vice president and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His supporters feared a plot to deny him the presidency in the upcoming elections. So, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s allies in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaked a copy of the bill to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>.'' `` Offended Federalists demanded an investigation of <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> and his illicit sources,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Vice President <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s presiding officer, was directed to read <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> a list of prepared questions about who had given him the bill, he said. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> asked for additional time to seek counsel, a request <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> quickly granted. `` That was the last the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> saw of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> recounted. `` When he failed to reappear, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> issued a contempt citation in his name. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> hid out through the remainder of the congressional session.'' When the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened the situation had changed. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> had won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and his party had captured majorities in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` Needless to say,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, `` the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority had no intention of pursuing charges of contempt against <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>.'' The first congressional investigation of a news leak was quietly shelved.

<TEXT>
 As struggling Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was wooing workers at a giant steel mill here with his trade-and-populism message, one of them handed him a button that read: `` Survival.'' The button referred to saving <ORGANIZATION> McLouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> through employee ownership, but it also aptly summed up <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s political goal in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Without a win here, it could be all over for the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman. But he hopes workers like the ones he campaigned among Monday will keep his bid alive. `` If we do n't do well here, obviously we are n't going to be able to continue the race,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> on March 10. Brushing aside questions about his future if he loses, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said over and over again Monday, `` I'm going to do well in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' Asked if he would run for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat if he loses Saturday, he declared: `` I'm going to win.'' `` I imagine he does have to'' win, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attorney general and chairman of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s effort in the state. But he was quick to say winning might not mean coming in first. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has strong black support in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and its suburbs, could be first. He said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> must beat <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner in delegates. `` If <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> beats <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his campaign is revived,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. But the polls do not support that prospect. A survey conducted March 15-17 for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the lead, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> far behind. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 33 percent, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 31 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 10 percent, with the rest of the field trailing. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said the polls do not tap the caucus-goers accurately, as the campaign expects only 100,000 to 150,000 Democrats to attend, a small fraction of the party faithful. `` I think a lot of people will be surprised by how well he does here,'' said <PERSON> Chick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Chick </ORGANIZATION>'s Rooster Lounge south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaigned Monday. `` But it's going to be tough.'' To turn the poll findings on their head, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has a message with a great deal of appeal in this state still shuddering from the massive changes in the auto and steel industries facing foreign competition. He denunciation of foreign trade practices _ epitomized by his rhetoric and ad saying `` a $ 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> K-car costs $ 48,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'' _ draws big applause from blue collar crowds. At the McLouth mill and at <ORGANIZATION> Chick </ORGANIZATION>'s on Monday, that line drew big cheers. `` He's the only one to take a stand on trade, a strong one,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindman </PERSON> outside the McLouth mill south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` ` Some of the people here were out of work for 4 -LCB- years,'' added <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridings </PERSON>. `` That's why we like <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is short of time and money to get his message out. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said the campaign has promised to spend between $ 300,000 and $ 500,000 on ads in the state. One campaign aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said, `` As fast the money comes in, we spend it.'' A key to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s victory is what the union leadership does in the state. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> have not endorsed anyone nationally, although their state affiliate in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> played a major role in his victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. That means <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is trying to pick up support local by local and district by district. At the McLouth plant, he won the backing of district director <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2659 </ORGANIZATION> official, said many members will follow the district leader's suggestion. That backing must be repeated over and over again across the state for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to win, for this caucus is not a simple process. The voting does not take place in the usual precincts across the state but in 567 locations that may not be familiar to the voters. That puts a premium on organization, which has been the trademark of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' effort this far. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> ad, which worked so well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, has come in for criticism in this state where autos are the economy. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> brushed aside suggestions the ad is inaccurate in its claim that the $ 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> car would cost $ 48,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. And he got some help in that from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, with whom he met on Monday in <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Asked if the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ad's figure was correct, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has the point correct, whatever the details. `` Damn close to it. Maybe it's only $ 35-40 ,000, but do n't lose sight of it, it's still a big difference between $ 7,000 here for a comparable car,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said to reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he was responding to a story in Monday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> saying a K-car would cost about $ 33,000 in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and that none is sold there. And <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, conceded that many of those taxes are levied in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on domestic consumption.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Banning reporters and photographers from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> could prove to be a public relations blunder for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and might not be effective anyway, several media observers say. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be `` bad policy'' for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to impose more restrictions on reporters covering unrest in the occupied territories. `` It would be a public relations risk _ one I hope they do n't take,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could jeopardize its reputation as the only true democracy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials cite in providing millions of dollars to the country each year. But the Israelis are obviously watching the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to determine if the advantages of restricting the press outweigh the disadvantages, he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s widely condemned white government has succeeded in dampening outside interest in that country's racial problems by banning coverage of any security activities, experts agree. The order went into effect in June 1986. But Gross doubted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be able to `` keep the lid on'' coverage of the occupied territories in a way the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> have virtually halted reporting in black areas. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s domestic political opposition and a thriving domestic press could prevent a blackout on coverage of the territories, he said. Local Israeli army commanders already have authority to close areas in the occupied territories at random, and they have been doing so with increasing frequency. A parliamentary committee in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is studying whether to ban the media formally from the territories. <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>, a well-known <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activist, said during a recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit that tough restrictions on the press would likely fail, because Israelis demand news and have an aggressive press corps. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Protect Journalists, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> group that monitors conditions for journalists worldwide, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might be able to stave off intense scrutiny by banning cameras. `` But in the long run the greater public interest is served by allowing the press access,'' he said. The committee opposes restrictions on reporters. Some Americans have joined Israeli government officials in complaining that reporters, particularly those working for foreign television networks, have helped incite rock-throwing Palestinians in the territories. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has said a television ban would be justified, and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> reportedly told prominent American Jews during a meeting that banning television cameras would be a good idea. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> says his remarks were distorted. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting criticized a `` censorship lobby'' for supporting restrictions that, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would be considered an unacceptable violation of freedom of the press. `` It would be one more comparison with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and it would hurt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. FAIR is a liberal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> group that examines the media. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friendly </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be wrong to ban reporters from the occupied territories. `` That ca n't be right _ that's what <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> did,'' he said. But Friendly said television coverage, with its time constraints and powerful pictures, can fail to portray a story accurately. ` What is also wrong is letting the picture run away with the story,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, had the same complaint. `` Television has polluted the public debate because it is inherently difficult for pictures to give context, history and meaning to events,'' he recently wrote.

 Because senators like to see farmers smile, your next <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> could cost an extra $ 1,800. If you do n't get the connection, that's just the way <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> works sometimes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Monday to grant farmers and some other taxpayers relief from the 15.1-cent-a-gallon tax on diesel fuel used for logging, farming, oil drilling, mining, fishing and other off-the-road business purposes. But since budget constraints require that every dollar of tax relief be offset by a dollar of tax increase on somebody else, the committee's bill would double the tax on fuel-guzzling cars _ mostly expensive imports whose miles-per-gallon do n't meet federal standards. Other sources of revenue for the diesel relief and a new `` taxpayer bill of rights'' include a few distilleries that dodge some of the $ 12.50-a-gallon tax on liquor by watering down products with a grape-based alcohol, and any number of people whose tax refunds could be grabbed to pay an overdue government loan. After all that, farmers may have to wait six months for their tax relief. There is some doubt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can complete action on legislation before April 1, when off-the-road diesel users are to begin paying the tax. They would have to wait for a refund until they file their income-tax returns next year. `` I just do n't want to go back home and explain to my farmers why we've set up this ridiculous bureaucratic nightmare,'' moaned Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., noted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is due to recess Easter To go back home with no settlement of the farmers' problem, he said, `` would be like us walking through a field of scorpions barefooted. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said the committee should, in effect, ask the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ignore the budget problem so farmers can be relieved Farmers and other off-road diesel users were caught up in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' efforts last year to reduce cheating on the fuel tax. The solution was to change the point of tax collection to the producer or wholesaler, and to require that those legally entitled to an exemption pay the tax and then apply for a refund when they file their income-tax returns the following year. The typical farmer would thus allow the government interest-free use of $ 320 of his money, some of it for up to a year. The panel's bill does nothing for another big group with a complaint: about 82,000 state, county and city government units that, starting Jan. 1, are now having to pay the 9.1-cent gasoline tax and apply for a refund later. The Finance Committee package, still subject to action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would: _ Allow diesel bought for off-road business use from wholesalers to escape the tax altogether Tax-exempt buyers from retailers would have to pay the tax and get a refund next year. This would cost the government $ 543 million through 1993. _ Create a `` taxpayer bill of rights,'' clamping down on perceived abuses by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> This would lose $ 517 million over five years. _ Extend through June 30, 1989, the expiring authority for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to withhold tax refunds from people who owe student loans, farm loans and other federal debts This would raise about $ 400 million. _ Double the tax on new cars whose fuel efficiency does not meet federal standards, raising $ 375 million through 1993 In the current model year, the tax hits only expensive foreign cars, such as the $ 38,000 <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> 780, which gets 21.2 miles per gallon, and the $ 61,130 Mercedes 560SL. Their guzzler taxes would rise to $ 1,300 and $ 3,600, respectively. _ Limit use of a `` wine flavors credit'' under which some manufacturers of distilled spirits avoid a significant share of the $ 12.50-a-gallon liquor tax by mixing some products with a grape-based alcohol This is expected to raise $ 360 million over five years.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, faced with bumping up against the federally-imposed campaign spending limit, revised some of his state spending figures downward in his newly filed campaign financial statement. The spending allocations for nine states showed lower cumulative expenditures in the report filed Monday than the figures <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported a month earlier. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s staff did not return a phone call Monday to answer questions about the revisions. In his report filed Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the former TV evangelist reported he had spent $ 19 million through Feb. 29 against the spending cap of $ 23 million that applies to expenditures for the entire primary season. Even with the downward revisions in some state spending figures, the total was still more than the $ 17.6 million in spending against the cap that he reported through the end of January. Candidates who receive federal matching funds must agree to stay within the spending limit. The reports candidates filed Monday show new financial activity for the month of February as well as cumulative totals. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s revisions were in figures reported for <LOCATION> Califonria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The biggest was in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where his previous report showed an allocation of $ 1.1 million, but the new report shows an allocation of $ 746,514 through February. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has spent more overall than any other candidate, also reported he borrowed another $ 1.9 million in February. He has taken out more than $ 9 million in loans since he began his campaign last year, and ended February with $ 8.4 million in debts and $ 7.4 million in cash on hand. Financial reports filed by his rivals show that Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also has narrowly outspent Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has built a huge lead over both <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the GOP race. Democratic contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of Massachussetts, continues to raise more money than his rivals, all of whom have resorted to borrowing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised $ 2.9 million in February, including federal matching funds, compared with less than $ 2 million each by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> borrowed and repaid $ 149,000, during February, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> borrowed $ 292,352, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> borrowed $ 500,000. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did not take out loans in February, which is the month covered by the new financial statements. But his aides have said he borrowed $ 1 million before the March 8 Super Tuesday contests in 20 states, and $ 300,000 before the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary March 15. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s receipts for February were $ 2 million, giving him $ 8.8 million for the year, including federal matching funds based on contributions raised privately. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised $ 1.5 million during February, $ 8.7 for the year, his report shows. But despite raising and spending more money through February, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> failed to interrupt the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> push toward the August nominating convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won 788 delegates so far to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 178, according to The Associated Press delegate count. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> raised $ 5 million for the month, including his $ 1.9 million loan, which brought his total receipts this year to $ 18.3 million. For the month, he spent $ 3.1 million, to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 5.3 million and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 4 million. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has spent $ 18 million against the spending camp, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> $ 14.1 million. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ended February with $ 836,445 in the bank and $ 716,107 in bills. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had $ 6.7 million in cash on hand _ more than any other candidate in the race _ and had $ 251,225 in debts. Among Democrats, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ended February with $ 1 million in debts and only about half that in available cash. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was $ 825,199 in debt, and had $ 760,755 in cash on hand, the reports showed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> owed $ 845,857, and had $ 428,420 on hand. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had $ 342,964 in the bank and $ 91,858 in debts. But that was before <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> took out $ 1.3 million in loans during March, according to capaign aides. Figures detailing those transactions will appear in the financial reports due next month. Candidates who run up debts generally do so in the knowledge they will be receiving federal matching funds to help pay off the loans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had $ 2.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the month, and $ 569,344 in debts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the Democrat closest to the spending cap, at $ 11.4 million.

<HEAD>Utility Moving To Boil Away Contaminated Water</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The operator of the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant has taken the first step in a plan to dispose of 2.3 million gallons of contaminated water that is a legacy of the 1979 accident at the plant. GPU Nuclear, operator of the plant near <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said Monday it is spending $ 800,000 for a system to boil away the water, even though that method has yet to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and public hearings are months away. `` We expect the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to approve the evaporation eventually, but it's possible that that would n't happen,'' <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomb </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview. Tomb identified the contractor as <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of Federal Way, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagner </PERSON> said utilities commonly make major expenditures for equipment before the commission grants permission for its use <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> might not consider the plan until December and the utility wants to be ready when approval comes. But <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION>, a citizens' group, said she was alarmed when <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear told the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> at a meeting last week that the company had authorized the contractor to design, install and begin testing the evaporation system. `` This is very distressing to the individuals and organizations involved here,'' she said. Most of the water is left over from the 1979 accident, while some has been used to decontaminate the plant. GPU Nuclear said the average additional radiation exposure from the evaporation would be about the same as `` the exposure from one to two hours of natural background radiation in the <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> area.'' The $ 7 million process involves boiling the water into steam released from a 100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities for shipment to a low-level radioactive waste dump. Tomb said testing at the plant would not use radioactive water. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerusky </PERSON>, a member of a citizens' advisory panel on the <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> cleanup and director of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, said some area residents `` were concerned about any releases from <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION>'' and favored leaving the water in storage tanks. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has given its blessing to the evaporation plan, but the commissioners have withheld formal approval pending public hearings. Disposal of the water is part of the $ 1 billion cleanup of Three Mile Island 2. During the accident, uranium fuel was allowed to lose the vital coolant that covers it, causing material in the core to begin melting. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear announced plans in December 1986 to place Unit 2 in storage indefinitely. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is expected to issue a report next month on whether the `` monitored storage'' plan poses any threat to the environment, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Masnik </PERSON> of the commission said Monday. While there are no plans to restart TMI-2, its twin reactor was not harmed in the accident and resumed operating in October 1985.

 Widespread publicity about a handful of sexual abuse cases involving day care centers may have caused parents to be more worried than necessary about the safety of their children, researchers say. A study released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> estimated that substantially more children are abused at home than in day care settings: 8.9 per 10,000 children at home compared with 5.5 per 10,000 at day care. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON>, who directed the study, said the results are `` a far cry'' from the impression many people have gotten because of news accounts about a few incidents of child abuse at day care centers. `` We do not think day care centers in general are high risk areas,'' said <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON>. However, he emphasized that child abuse does occur at some day care centers and is particularly hard to ferret out because the perpetrators do not fit stereotypes. Only 8 percent had prior arrest records, 50 percent were college graduates and 40 percent were women, he said. `` We just ca n't say there is a nice shortcut, a couple of easy rules to spot places that might be dangerous,'' he said. For example, <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON> noted, the study found no signficant differences between the incidence of child abuse in centers with a high teacher-to-pupil ratio and in less adequately staffed centers. However, <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON> and two other participants at a news conference underscored the importance of parents having ready access to day care center activity and making surprise visits to see what is going on. `` Parents need to go the extra mile to become familiar with the day care center they choose,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` They should drop in unannounced and if the center does n't like it, they should consider whether that is the kind of place they want their children to be.'' <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON> said he agreed with the study's findings and said day care centers generally `` are safe places for children.'' <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Early </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Childhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, said the report was the `` most comprehensive, national study of child sexual abuse in day care to date.'' `` It is our hope that Dr. <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON>'s findings ... will be as widely disseminated and as influential to policy makers as were reports of several infamous cases of abuse in the past,'' she said. The survey examined 270 cases of sexual abuse involving 1,639 children from 1983 to 1985 and made an in-depth study of a random sample of 43 cases. An estimated 1.5 million children were cared for in day care centers during that time. <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON> said there is no evidence the incidence of child abuse in day care settings was higher during the past two years than during the 1983-85 period surveyed. The study was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neglect </ORGANIZATION>, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and released in conjunction with the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Supporters of former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will apparently control the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> convention in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> next month as a result of weekend county conventions, party officials said. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republicans use a three-step system of caucuses and conventions to pick their national convention delegates. The process began with precinct caucuses last month, at which a straw poll was conducted. In the straw poll, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led with 27 percent, followed by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with 22 percent and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with 15 percent. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters claimed victory by saying most of the 23 percent undecided voters in the poll actually were <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters. The straw poll participants were not bound to presidential candidates, however. At the county conventions, held over this past weekend, delegates were elected to the state convention April 21-23, where in turn national convention delegates will be elected. The delegate breakdown for the state convention wo n't be known for several days. But the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> forces dominated Republican conventions in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s two biggest counties, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washoe </LOCATION>. Party leaders said it appeared <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> got more than half the 800 state delegates in those two counties alone. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also picked up some delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s county conventions elsewhere in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, although his supporters showed less strength in the outlying areas, party officials said. State GOP Chairwoman <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON> said Monday that party newcomers _ which most <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers are _ are welcome. But she added there is frustration because <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> probably will wind up with its 20-member delegation to the national convention committed to somone who wo n't be the presidential nominee. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s state director, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, said there's no way he would encourage the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delegates to switch to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the state convention level, even though their candidate is clearly far behind. `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters are not about to roll over. They're making a statement and sticking to their commitment,'' he said However, he said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters would be prepared to support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the national Republican convention. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, after big losses on Super Tuesday, indicated he intends to remain in the race, but has virtually given up hope of getting the nomination. He has talked more at recent appearances about his role at the convention, his long-term influence on the party and a possible bid in 1992.

<HEAD>Government Rings Up Deficit, But Smaller So Far Than Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government ran up a $ 23.9 billion budget deficit in February, but the red ink is still running slightly behind last year's total, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports. The deficit in February came after a rare surplus of $ 16.1 billion in January which had occurred because the Social Security benefits for that month were mailed early and counted in the December spending figures. For the first five months of the budget year, the government has run up a deficit of $ 89.7 billion, 4.9 percent lower than the red ink incurred in the same period a year ago. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is projecting a deficit of $ 146.7 billion for the entire fiscal year, a drop of 2.4 percent from the $ 150.4 billion deficit in the 1987 budget year. But this projection is lower than estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and many private forecasters who contend the administration is being too optimistic about the economic outlook. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> is forecasting a $ 157 billion deficit, and some private economists are estimating an even higher $ 170 billion deficit for the budget year that ends on Sept. 30. The deficit in 1987 dipped from a record $ 221.2 billion shortfall in 1986 because of an unexpected windfall in tax revenues caused by changes in the new tax law. Some analysts think there could be a second, smaller windfall this year if people end up owing more on their taxes under the new tax law than they did under the old law, something which will not be known until after the April 15 tax filing deadline is passed. `` We may have another April surprise which could add an additional $ 10 billion to revenue for the year,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said if the windfall does materialize, the deficit could decline to around $ 160 billion, but that would still be above the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's estimate. In February, government revenue totaled $ 60.4 billion while government spending totaled $ 84.3 billion. For the first five months of the year, revenues total $ 347 billion while the government spent $ 436.7 billion. The largest spending categories in February, as usual, were the military followed by Social Security and interest on the national debt. Military spending totaled $ 23.1 billion last month and $ 116.6 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago. Spending for Social Security totaled $ 17.9 billion last month and $ 86.6 billion for the past five months, up 5.1 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. The other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 12.9 billion in February and $ 63.4 billion so far this budget year, a 2.3 percent increase over 1987. Interest on the $ 2.5 trillion national debt totaled $ 15 billion last month and $ 90.8 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.8 percent over the same period last year, the fastest increase of any of the major categories. For the entire 1988 budget year, interest on the national debt is projected to total $ 210 billion, amounting to one-fifth of total government spending.

<HEAD>Smaller Crop, Higher Demand Mean That Ain't Hay</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hay prices nationally have been averaging around 12 percent higher than a year ago, reflecting a smaller 1987 crop and some increase in demand. The Agriculture Department in January revised 1987 hay output downward to 149.1 million tons from last October's preliminary forecast of 153.7 million tons. A new report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hay area turned out to be about 500,000 acres larger than estimated in October but that the yield was reduced by 4 percent to 2.46 tons per acre. The 1987 hay crop was 6.4 million tons smaller than the record of 155.5 million tons produced in 1986. `` Alfalfa and alfalfa mixture hay production turned out to be 84.6 million tons, down 7 million tons from 1986, and all other hay production of 64.6 million tons was 600,000 tons above the previous year's 64 million,'' the report said. Acording to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> production figures for 1987, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was the leading all-hay state with more than 9 million tons, followed by: <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, 8.88 million; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 7.8 million; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 7.09 million; and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 6.93 million. Last May 1 at the start of the 1987-88 hay crop season, the inventory on hand was estimated at 32.4 million tons, the most since 1980. Adding the 1987 crop, that made a total hay supply of 181.5 million tons for the marketing year that runs through April 30, slightly less than the 1986-87 suppply of 182.2 million tons. The hay stockpile on Dec. 1 was reported at 119.7 million tons, meaning that 61.8 million tons had been consumed during the seven months since May 1. In the same period a year earlier, hay consumption was 60.5 million tons, the report said. Hay prices paid by farmers and ranchers averaged $ 64.60 per ton during the May-November period, up $ 4.74 per ton from a year earlier. In December and January of this year, prices averaged $ 63.75 per ton, up $ 7.65 from a year earlier. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, the value of hay production in 1987, based on market prices, was more than $ 9.1 billion, ranking the crop third among all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm commodities. Only corn at $ 12.2 billion and soybeans, $ 10.4 billion, were valued higher. Those value estimates, incidentally, are not sales receipts or marketings. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates are based upon total farm values, whether a commodity is sold or used by the producer.

Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said Monday the surplus powdered milk was sold by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> CONASUPO </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government's food purchasing authority. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the sale `` reflects the world market price for non-fat dry milk at the time the sale was negotiated'' with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Deliveries are scheduled through March 1989. In addition, the CCC provided <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with a three-year credit arrangement at commercial rates of interest, he said. According to a recent CCC report, about 454 million pounds of non-fat dry milk were held in storage, with a value of more than $ 385 million, or about 85 cents per pound. There are approximately 2,205 pounds in a metric ton, which translates to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> value of $ 1,874 per ton. The surplus was acquired by CCC through purchases of cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk to support the price of milk paid to dairy farmers. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 farm law mandated the export sale of 150,000 tons of dairy products annually for the three fiscal years ending Sept. 30, 1988. The latest deal with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> boosted sales this year to 77,520 tons, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said.

 Exporters have sold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an additional 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The sale, equal to 7.34 million bushels, was handled by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and will be shipped in the 1988-89 wheat marketing year that will begin on June 1. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the sales were part of an authorized 1.2 million tons of wheat announced Feb. 5 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP Although no selling prices or other details were announced, recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $ 2.67 per bushel, indicating a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm value of about $ 20 million. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought more than 4 million tons of wheat under previous EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the bonus averaged $ 24.45 per ton, or about 67 cents per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has 260,000 tons remaining for use under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> initiative announced on Feb. 5, he said

<HEAD>Senate Clears Way For Uranium Agreement With Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has removed a roadblock to a 30-year nuclear cooperation pact with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, rejecting claims by opponents that the new agreement could add to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 53-50 Monday evening to reject a resolution to disapprove the agreement, which provides for the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> uranium and uranium enrichment equipment to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over the next 30 years. It replaces a more restrictive cooperation arrangement which was to expire at the end of the century. As the matter stands, the agreement will take effect at the end of April, 90 legislative days after it was submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Under the rules governing consideration of the agreement, it could be rejected only if both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed resolutions of disapproval and the president signed them. The most controversial element of the new agreement is a provision giving <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> advance consent for 30 years to reprocess U.S.-controlled spent nuclear fuel and to use plutonium separated from that fuel without the case-by-case approval required by the present agreement. Plutonium is the key ingredient in the production of nuclear weapons. Since the process involves shipment of the nuclear material to reprocessing plants in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, opponents of the agreement contended it will loosen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control on the movement of plutonium, open opportunities for terrorists and potentially lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Responding to these and other concerns, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 15-3 at the end of last year to recommend that the agreement be renegotiated. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and supporters of the agreement on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor said that permitting it to take effect would continue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence over the Japanese nuclear program while providing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a major long-term sales market. But Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the Foreign Relations panel, echoed many other senators in contending the agreement does not meet the non-proliferation standards of the Atomic Energy Act. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the agreement does not meet legal requirements and gives no assurance of effective non-proliferation safeguards. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the present law works well and that its case-by-case approval arrangements should not be scrapped. But some supporters of the agreement said opponents were motivated less by a genuine concern over nuclear proliferation than by anger at Japanese trading practices. `` There is a certain amount of emotional <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> bashing going on around here,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, R-Idaho. Contending that rejecting the agreement would hurt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ which would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in uranium sales _ and not <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> added: `` Actually it's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bashing we're engaged in here. Rejecting this agreement will hurt us and not the Japanese.''

 Old loves and old photographs gave a sentimental air to the deportation hearing of a Welshman who says he should be allowed to stay in this country because he is the illegitimate son of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier. The claims of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, 43, were supported Monday in federal Immigration Court by the kin of the late <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cundy </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who died in 1970, was an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier stationed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, a janitor, insists he is the product of a union between <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. No one has found any legal documents to prove the relationship, but <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s kin say that for many years he talked openly about his son `` Buddy'' overseas. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contends <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> has n't proved <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was his father It has also said <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> has a criminal record, including attempting to steal a radiator from an abandoned railway car. After <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> returned from the war, he fathered seven children in this country and married three different women. About a dozen members of the <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> clan came from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to stand by the man they believe is one of them. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> also was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, 37, and sons, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, 17, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, 12. As British citizens, they can apply for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship if <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> wins his case, which is built on memories, family photos, birth and death certificates and letters. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s first wife, <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, told Immigration Judge <PERSON> Billino </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Ambrosio </PERSON> that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> wished he could bring <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> and her son to this country but never had the money. `` As soon as he met me he told me all about it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>. `` He told me he lived with her _ and I know he was in love with her _ and he had a son by her.'' She said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Allegra </PERSON>, often wrote to Mrs. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> and sent clothing and gifts. During the hearing, <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> sat with head bent at the back of the small courtroom. He wiped an occasional tear from his eyes. His burgundy corduroy jacket was emblazoned with the name of his adopted hometome, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and a large American flag patch was sewn over his heart. Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> said her first husband once told her he signed a sworn statement that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> was his son. The document has n't been found But she said the documentation of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s blood is in the face of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>. `` I swear by my life on it. -LRB- <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> -RRB- looked more like my husband than my children,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said he first learned of his relationship with <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> in 1968 from his mother, who died 11 years later. In October 1984, <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> came to this country on a tourist visa with his family. Their visas expired in 1985 and <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> has asserted his right to citizenship since. In 1986, federal rules were changed to give citizenship rights to foreign children fathered by American men outside marriage. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>' family can stay here until the case is settled. A hearing was continued to July 7.

 Married virgins, celebrity children and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women who marry Saudis are n't listed in the Yellow Pages. So where do TV talk show hosts <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> find those people, anyway? `` Viewer mail is one way we get ideas for guests,'' <PERSON> Lorri </PERSON> <PERSON> Antosz </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, chief producer for `` <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>,'' said Monday. `` To get the off-beat people that you want, you have to rely on the mails, because there are people out there who write in willing to tell you all about themselves,'' Ms. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The `` Oprah Winfrey'' show looks for entire audiences that fit a theme of the Chicago-based show. Its ad on daytime television last week asked, `` If you live with a slob, have ever lived with a slob or your parents were slobs, please contact the <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> show.'' `` We get 200 names and call back those with the best stories,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>'s publicist. `` We did a show on twins and we had an audience full of twins.'' The `` Geraldo'' show syndicated from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since September recently asked for ideas from various sources. `` I sent him 10 ideas on who I'd like to see on the show and topics I wanted to see done,'' said <PERSON> Joanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> publicist for <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s syndicated specials. Talk shows also use many other methods. Usually producers spot something in a newspaper or on television, then spend hours tracking down the right guests. `` We have extensive files: every magazine published, newspapers from the top 15 or 20 markets. We're always clipping things,'' Miss <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes the author or guest themselves suggest other people to have on the show.'' With <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said, `` Mostly it's word of mouth. You talk to people who give you names of other people, or you ask the audience if they know of anybody.'' Finding the right guests for a show often has been tough detective work. `` We did a show on women who marry Saudis, and go over there and find life is not so good,'' Ms. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` We got that from the mails, but then it gets more difficult. We started talking to people, calling embassies. Then I ran across a book about this subject, and the author had names of people, and they knew people.''

<HEAD>Key Government Agent Orange Study Flawed, New Air Force Review
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> report says an often-cited 1984 government study that was supposed to be `` reassuring'' for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans exposed to Agent Orange was flawed. The revised study said while the chemical defoliant could not be `` confidently identified'' as the reason for a series of health problems among veterans who handled the chemical, it could not be `` exonerated'' either. The report, released Monday by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, was hailed by veteran activists as a major breakthrough `` For the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is saying in a major way that they can not rule out dioxin as the cause of ill-health effects,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasinitz </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said they have never categorically ruled out a link between Agent Orange and health problems. But critics say the 1984 study gave that impression when it said, `` In the full context, the baseline study results should be viewed as reassuring to the Ranch Handers and their families at this time.'' `` What they're doing is trying to reverse themselves without really saying so,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamburg </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrou </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> aide, said, `` We have gotten a clear sense that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> wants to work with us to get the truth out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> rejected the senators' contention that the 1984 Ranch Hand study was `` seriously'' flawed. `` I think that's an overstatement,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, chief of epidemiology at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the senior investigator in the Agent Orange probe. `` There are areas of that report that we have less confidence in the conclusions,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. But he said the bulk of the 1984 findings were upheld by the review. The key problem with the original study, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said, was assumptions about exposure that failed to take work habits into consideration. Government scientists now realize that certain workers were sloppier than others in handling Agent Orange, and therefore had a greater exposure that was not taken into account, he said. The studies are part of the government's 20-year investigation of Agent Orange and its impact on soldiers who handled the defoliant. Operation Ranch Hand was the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s code name for the aerial spraying. Last year, a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> study found increased deaths due to lung cancer and certain lymph cancers among <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran Marines, providing what veterans' groups called the first clear scientific data implicating Agent Orange. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> also said the 1984 study incorrectly concluded that all birth defects were limited to the skin. And the senators said the revised study indicated that the 1984 study erred by saying the only type of cancer found among the Agent Orange veterans was skin cancer. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> defended the original conclusion, saying, `` There is an increase in the skin cancer in the exposed group, but not in more serious forms of cancers.'' Since the 1984 study, scientists have discovered a way to detect dioxin levels in blood even years after exposure. Blood samples have been taken from 2,010 veterans who worked with Agent Orange and that analysis should be ready within two years, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, both Vietnam War veterans, are pushing legislation to compensate veterans who suffer from certain conditions that may be tied to Agent Orange exposure.

<HEAD>ACLU Welcomes Rehearing Of Case on Court-Ordered Caesarean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is hailing a federal appeals court's decision to rehear the case of a terminally ill woman who underwent a court-ordered Caesarean section against her wishes and those of her doctors. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paltrow </PERSON> said Monday the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to grant a rehearing is significant because it vacates a ruling that allowed the `` sacrifice of a pregnant woman's life in the name of so-called fetal life.'' The eight-member court, acting on a petition from the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that the full court would rule on a case previously decided upon by a three-judge panel of the appeals court. The three appellate judges had refused to block a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order that the woman undergo a Caesarean section. The order was issued after <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> sought a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling `` as to what it should do in terms of the fetus, whether to intervene -LRB- by Caesarean section -RRB- and save its life.'' The three-judge appeals panel based its decision not to block the lower court's ruling on the belief that the woman's death was imminent and that the child had a better chance of surviving if delivered before her death. The 27-year-old woman, a leukemia patient identified as <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON>, gave birth in June to a baby girl who died shortly after the Ceasarean operation at the university hospital. The mother died two days later. The full appeals court, in a ruling issued Thursday and made public Monday, agreed to rehear the case and ordered the submission of briefs by March 28. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said the three-judge panel's ruling needed rehearing because the panel `` made a number of grave mistakes'' and raised the question of `` may a court order a person to submit to potentially life-extinguishing surgery for the benefit of another person, much less for a fetus whose chances of survival are slim.''

<TEXT>
 A former state trooper was found guilty Monday of murder in the slaying of his trooper girlfriend, who was shot three times in the head after he took out a $ 350,000 life insurance policy on her. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury deliberated more than three hours before finding <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> guilty on the charges of capital murder for financial gain and capital murder of a law officer. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, 31, had been a trooper less than seven months when she failed to respond to radio calls while on night patrol Oct. 11, 1987. The next day, investigators found her body in her patrol car behind a rural church. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, who had said that he and Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> had discussed marriage, held his chin with both hands as the verdict was announced, while his family, seated two rows behind him, began to cry. Circuit Judge <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> denied a defense motion to delay the sentencing phase of the trial, which will begin Tuesday. The jury can recommend either life in prison without parole for <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, 33, or death in the state's electric chair. The final decision between those two options will be up to the judge. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> initially told investigators that he did not know Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>'s whereabouts the night of her disappearance. Several days later, he changed his story, saying that he was scheduled to meet her at the church the night she was killed but that when he arrived she was dead. He was then arrested and charged with murder. During closing arguments earlier Monday, defense attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> was guilty only of poor judgment for failing to report her death and not telling investigators that he had seen her body the night she died. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> had told authorities he had been afraid to report her death after finding the body. Insurance agents testified that <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> and Miss Cobb each purchased $ 350,000 life insurance policies that named each other as beneficiaries. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the jurors that <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> was deeply in debt and plotted to collect from Miss Cobb's insurance policy. But <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said investigators failed to fully examine possible links between the slaying and the arrest in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> of a man driving a vehicle similar to a car spotted in the area where Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>'s body was found.

<HEAD>South Texas Nuclear Plant Receives Full-Power License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first reactor at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Nuclear Project will be allowed to operate at full power despite last-minute efforts by opponents to halt it because of alleged dangerous flaws. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 5-0 Monday to approve a full-power operating license for the reactor, part of a $ 5.5 billion, twin-reactor, 2,500-megawatt generating station 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A group headed by Citizens Concerned About Nuclear Power of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> sued in the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Friday to stop the license and was rebuffed by the judges without comment on Monday. The Government Accountability Project, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, had petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff to delay Monday's vote pending a fuller investigation of 700 allegations of intimidation, other wrongdoing or shoddy construction. But that was rejected late Friday. <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Garde </PERSON>, a lawyer for the GAP, said after Monday's vote, `` To handle it this way was very insulting to several dozen people who have come to the commission. ... They're not anti-nuclear activists.'' The commission acted after a staff briefing on an investigation of some of the concerns brought to the commission's attention by the GAP, which tries to encourage and protect people who disclose wrongdoing. `` It is the staff's judgment that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> can be operated without undue risk to the health and safety of the public,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON>, director of an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> special team that investigated the allegations, told the commission in repeating the conclusions of the team report issued a week ago on the 213 allegations judged to be safety-related. GAP presented two previously unidentified whistleblowers at a morning news conference criticizing last week's special team report. One of them, engineer <PERSON> Ashok </PERSON> <PERSON> Garg </PERSON>, who left the project in September 1986, said he provided the team a reference to a plant document from April 1986, which said among other things that 20 percent of valves for plant instruments had been installed backwards. <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON>, however, said in an interview after the commission meeting: `` We reviewed that document, and we interviewed him, but he could n't remember details. With those instrument valves, it does n't make any difference if they are installed frontwards or backwards.'' <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the project manager, has about a 48 percent share, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> has slightly more than 25 percent, the city of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> has about 16 percent and the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> has about 10 percent. Austin at one point sued <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION>, charging mismanagement, but those two parties are close to an agreement under which <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> would take over <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>'s ownership. A construction permit was issued in 1975. The total cost to the four owners will be some 500 percent above initial estimates. The second unit is more than 80 percent complete.

 Strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has offered to resign before next year's presidential elections if opponents agree to talks with his regime, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s chief of state told his countrymen Monday. The opposition, whose general strike Monday paralyzed the nation, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has kept up steady pressure to force a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resignation, immediately rejected the general's offer Elections are scheduled for May 1989. `` There will be no dialogue,'' said <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, the main leader of the National Civic Crusade, an anti-Noriega coalition of 200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called the indefinite work stoppage. He added: `` The general has to go _ immediately, not eventually. The strike will continue.'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, installed last month as the minister in charge of the presidency, made the announcement of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offer in a nationally broadcast speech. He said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had given his word `` as an officer and a gentleman'' to step down if his conditions are met. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said: `` We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy to attempt to legitimize the illegal <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> regime by calling for negotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort on the part of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to maintain direct or indirect control of the Panamanian Defense Forces. `` We stand by our previous view that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go, and the sooner the better for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment on federal drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has dried up the flow of money to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency, in the effort to force him out, and the economy is near collapse. The general put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last week and rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for him to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and live in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said earlier Monday that there were no plans for further talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the return of two administration officials from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I think they have a pretty good reading of the general's attitude,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` It did n't seem to include further conversations, at least at this point.'' The strike included <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s central commercial district, where the small shops that cater to the lower and middle classes had not joined previous shutdowns by wealthier businesmen and industrialists. `` We're sending <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a message,'' said the owner of a shoe store, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. `` We hope he's listening.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands the military and police as head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and is the power behind the civilian government. The secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said a man died Monday of wounds suffered when he was hit in the face and chest by birdshot fired by police during disturbances in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last Wednesday. It was the fourth protest-related death since anti-government demonstrations began last summer. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents hailed the strike as their greatest triumph so far. `` It's completely successful,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today has been a very special day ... in the capital as well as the provinces. We hope <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s advisers and the people surrounding him will help him to see the reality.'' `` The paralyzation is total in industry, finance and commerce,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, a business leader. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> are directors, along with <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, of the National Civic Crusade. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made another move Monday to strengthen his control of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> by announcing the promotions of 98 officers to ranks ranging from colonel to lieutenant. Among those promoted to colonel was <PERSON> Eros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cal </PERSON>, who was named last week to replace Col. <PERSON> Leonidas </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON>, the leader of the foiled coup, as the nation's police chief. The Defense Forces also said administrative discipline would be taken against 17 officers implicated in last Wednesday's attempted coup, but did not give details. It previously acknowledged eight or nine officers had joined in the attempt and said only five were being detained. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of the striking dockworkers said leaders of all major unions were summoned to a meeting Sunday night with <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, and told the military would not interfere if the strike remained peaceful. He said union leaders were told the government, which could not meet its payroll two weeks ago, also would be unable to cover semi-monthly paychecks due next week. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was dismissed by the legislature after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and still is recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Because the government has silenced opposition newspapers and broadcast stations, thousands of people went to work without knowing a strike had been called. Most went home when they found stores and offices closed. By midday, the city was a ghost town patrolled by helmeted soldiers in combat gear. The government said they were providing security for businesses that chose to open. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ailing economy came apart after Feb. 25, when <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the legislature fired <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Banks closed the following week and the government could not meet a $ 33 million payroll for 130,000 public employees. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has cut off economic and military aid and millions of dollars in Panamanian funds have been frozen in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks by legal actions.

 Horrifying television film of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral mourners beating up two British soldiers who were then killed has brought demands to restrict coverage of such scenes. Some lawmakers urged restrictions on funeral coverage or interviews with leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. They argue that the cameras' presence encourages rioting and boosts `` terrorist organizations. `` We're fighting what is in the nature of a war here,'' said <PERSON> Ivor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanbrook </PERSON>, senior legislator of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in urging a ban on interviews with <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` We would n't have dreamed during the war of giving currency to <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> so I do n't see why we should give any credence ... to people acting as the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s propagandists.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has criticized British TV networks for giving the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> what she calls the `` oxygen of publicity.'' But the Home Office said Monday there were no plans to impose bans on covering IRA-related news events. `` When it comes to covering a demonstration in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or a riot or anything, we ca n't start saying you go there or you do n't go there or we would n't have a free press,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Conservative lawmaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mates </PERSON> said the publicly funded <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and commercial <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> should exercise self-restraint. `` I think you have to look very carefully at the question of whether you would be getting 10,000 people coming to these funerals if it was n't for the fact that they are whipped up out there,'' Mates said in a radio interview. `` They are paraded by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> for the TV cameras so that the world can see that their heroes are being buried with the total support of the whole population ... they're made to go along because it's got to be a spectacle.'' Cameras filmed the initial attack Saturday on the soldiers' car in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, but were chased off by mourners before the beating began in earnest, and they did not film the shooting of the men a few minutes later. British newspapers, however, published pictures of the near-naked bodies the next day. `` It was a shocking, brutal event and I was as horrified as anyone to see things like that on my television screen,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grade </PERSON>, head of commercial Channel 4. `` But you can not sanitize a story ... The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> and ITN made people understand the horror of the situation,'' he told Today newspaper. `` We take great care in what we show,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ITN </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp-Newton </PERSON>. But `` by not showing it we'll not make it go away.'' Still, there are inconsistencies. British networks often preface violent scenes with a warning to viewers, but none preceded the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> footage. In the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the state media can not broadcast interviews with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, on the grounds that they speak for an outlawed organization, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has imposed stringent curbs on reporting in what are defined as `` unrest areas.'' Offenders face prison, fines or expulsion. The South Africans say violent incidents dropped by 35 percent immediately after the restrictions were decreed in June 1986. International criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> unrest has prompted charges that foreign networks distort the country's image and inflame unrest President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> asked this month whether <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> democracy should `` allow this weapon to be turned against my children and my country.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state, and Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have suggested that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ban TV crews outright from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not gone that far, but on March 4 the military for the first time banned reporters and TV crews from extensive areas of the occupied lands. They have since renewed the ban repeatedly, generally on a smaller scale.

 When Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived here last fall, homosexuals took to the streets to protest the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s condemnation of their way of life Roman Catholic officials believe the visit helped heal relations between homosexuals and the church, but gay activists still recoil in anger when speaking of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. The pope encountered the largest and angriest demonstrations of his nine-city tour during his 21-hour visit to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Outside Mission <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON>, where the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> met with AIDS victims, 2,000 protesters shouted `` pope, go home'' and `` shame, shame.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, chief publicist for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, contends protests were even smaller than reported and reflected well upon the church's conciliation efforts. `` I think there was tremendous healing with the whole gay community and with AIDS patients,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` I think much of the healing took place before he came.'' The archdiocese and a coalition of gay groups met before the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s visit and drafted a joint statement of non-violence. Recently, the archdiocese announced the opening of a 40-bed hospice for homeless AIDS patients. Before the pope's visit, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> published a theological letter that called homosexualtiy an `` intrinsic moral evil.'' While declaring God's love for homosexuals, the church is opposed to homosexual relationships. `` We are going to be ourselves,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>, an attorney who coordinated an umbrella group of homosexuals and bisexuals to oppose the Sept. 17-18 visit. `` We are going to relate to members of our own sex, just as heterosexual people relate to people of the opposite sex. `` Basically, so long as they insist that same-sex is sinful, they are our adversaries,'' <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> said. However, confrontations between church and homosexuals have moved elsewhere. Members of Dignity, made up of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, sexually active gays, were arrested during demonstrations in March and February at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At one of those services, Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the church's teaching against homosexual behavior would not be changed. `` We can not alter the Gospel,'' he said.

 After picking up Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s backing, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'll carry two messages stressed by <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> _ the importance of improving education and the need for Republicans to reach out to voters traditionally aligned with Democrats `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> has done a remarkable job in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. And it is reaching out to our fellow Republicans, but it is also going after those in the Democratic column,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He has demonstrated that the open-door policy works. His success is an inspiration of what we can accomplish nationally.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the remarks Monday at a joint appearance in which <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and the state's county <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> chairmen abandoned their neutrality in the presidential race and threw their support to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> decided to support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the vice president won the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary last week. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s county Republican chairmen, who had been waiting for <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> to act, followed the governor's lead and voted to endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a breakfast meeting Monday morning. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is our leader, and with the Republican vision of a stronger <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that offers oppportunity to all regardless of color or creed, we can not only retain the presidency, but send -LRB- House Speaker -RRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to the back benches for the rest of this century,'' said <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. After Monday's announcement, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> left with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help the vice president campaign in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, which holds its primary next Tuesday. One GOP county chairman said the endorsements almost assure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 64 Republican delegates. The state's primary is June 7. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then said he would `` shamelessly steal'' the governor's message that Republicans must reach out to blacks, unions and others traditionally aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who picked up minority and union support in winning re-election by a landslide in 1985 has been touted as a possible vice presidential candidate.

Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The disclosure that a former federal prosecutor may have fabricated death threats against herself and a magistrate during an extradition case has shocked her former colleagues. On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> allegedly cut out words from newspapers to form threatening messages that she received in the mail during the case she was handling against two Sikhs accused of terrorism in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. A search of her house turned up similar threatening messages in a travel bag and scissors apparently used to clip newspapers and magazines, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. No charges were filed, but an investigation was continuing, he said. Few lawyers in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and in private practice would speak publicly, but almost all interviewed Monday said Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> had been a highly intelligent and hard-driven assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. `` I've been sick over this thing ever since I found out about a week and a half ago,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, one of Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s three partners who left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office with her last summer to form their own firm After leaving, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> was appointed a special assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney to enable her to continue with the case against the Sikhs, <PERSON> Ranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Sukhminder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 26. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, called Monday's disclosures `` clearly the most astounding thing I've heard'' and said he would seek to have all extradition proceedings against the men dropped. During the case, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> had strongly denied that any supporters of the Sikhs were behind the threats, and had suggested the Indian government may be involved. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s alleged responsibility for the threats had no affect on the outcome of the extradition hearings in February, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> approved extradition. But <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said he would seek a new hearing `` to avoid any appearance of impropriety.'' During the hearings, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> did not specifically accuse the two men of having sent the notes, but cited the death threats in requesting added security. Sharpshooters lined nearby rooftops, observers passed through two metal detectors, dozens of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals attended and nearby streets were closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> is handling the investigation of the 36-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, the former deputy chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's Criminal Division, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fettweis </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s attorney and former colleague in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, said she was in a private hospital. He would not comment on any aspect of the case or the nature of her hospitalization. The disclosure of the investigation came during a court session requested by <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> to `` correct and supplement'' the record regarding the threats. Suspicions about the threats were raised when Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents on Feb. 5 that a letter saying `` No more warning <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> death for you'' was hand-delivered to the hotel where she was under 24-hour guard. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent's affidavit unsealed Monday said none of the deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals guarding her saw anyone enter or leave the area around her room. The 24-hour guard was ordered after Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> submitted to <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> during the extradition hearings sealed information about previous alleged threats. One letter addressed to Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said, `` Do n't get dead. Do n't go to court.'' The magistrate received a threatening letter two weeks before the extradition hearings, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> laboratory analysis showed that typewritten characters on envelopes containing the threats matched those on Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s 1983 application to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, he said The typewriter matching the print also was found in her home. The Indian government charges that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> plotted the revenge assassination of a retired Indian general who led the bloody 1984 assault against <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants occupying the Sikhs' holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> was charged in the killing of a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member.

<HEAD>Senate Urges Talks With USSR To Curb `Bandit' Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is urging the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to open negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> aimed at curbing uncontrolled `` bandit'' fishing from international waters in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. A 79-0 vote on Monday approved a non-binding, sense-of-the-Senate resolution which declares that foreign fishing fleets are using a zone located between the 200-mile fishing limits established by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as `` a staging ground for raids'' into one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. According to the resolution, immediate action to protect <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fishery resources is needed because of lack of cooperation by other high-seas fishing nations under existing agreements. The resolution calls for the convening of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to impose a moratorium on all fishing in the zone, a ban which would stay in effect until an international fishery management agreement is negotiated. Because of its location, completely surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet territorial waters, the 4,500 square mile area is known variously as `` the hole in the doughnut'' or `` the doughnut.''

 An elderly couple that gave a job and shelter to a homeless <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> man have learned that you can take <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> out of the city, but you ca n't take the city out of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>. `` I think he's going to be happier with his people,'' <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said Monday. `` He seemed very happy here. It seemed like he thought a lot of us. We thought a lot of him. It started out nice and ended nice.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> spent three months working at the junkyard owned by Mrs. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, 68, and her husband, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, 75. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> withdrew $ 300 from a Portales bank Monday and boarded an eastbound bus. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had planned to work at the junkyard through the summer, but said he could n't do it without any wages. `` A man ca n't live with just room and board,'' he said. `` After three months with room and board, you know, I want to have a family and stuff. Room and board just does n't make it. `` I'm thinking about getting married pretty soon,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I just want to get somewhere where I can get established and have an income.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> much of last year living in a rotting wood and canvas shack on the banks of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The Gilmans read of his plight in a story about the homeless in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and how they were enduring the subzero temperatures. The couple called The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and said if <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> were willing to work they'd give him a job and a roof over his head. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 35, arrived Jan. 17 in <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION>, an eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> farming and ranching community of about 11,000 people. His home here was an 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer in the junkyard where he worked eight hours a day, six days a week, tearing apart old cars and rebuilding the engines. The other day, he said, was spent working in the fields at a church-run orphanage, where his benefactors volunteered his service. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had not been paid after a month on the job, and the <PERSON> Gilmans </PERSON> said his room and board were his remuneration. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' boss, the Gilmans' son <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> did n't give any notice he was quitting. He said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told him Monday morning he was homesick and was ready to go. `` The girl I was going with in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> wants to get married,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. He also said he was going to try to find a place to stay, and see if his brother might help him. But he said the Gilmans were nice people and had placed $ 300 in the bank for him. `` It seems like it's better for both of us because they say they're going in the hole,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` They say they're going into the hole on account of me staying there. I do n't want to put a lot of pressure on those people.'' Before gaining national attention, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> wore ill-fitting clothes and ate in soup kitchens. He and another man endured the harsh winter in a lean-to shack rather than try to find refuge in city-run shelters. By the time <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> boarded a bus for the 1,478-mile, 27-hour journey to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> people had donated new clothes, new luggage and spending money. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Monday he was leaving rather than trying to find work in <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION> because he did n't want to put pressure on people in the community. He also said he had had offers to live in nearby Clovis. Although <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> apparently had no job waiting for him in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he has said his days among the homeless are over. `` I never knew I'd end up like I did,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in an interview in February. `` I hope I do n't end up in a slump like that again. That ai n't no kind of life for a man.''

According to the resolution, immediate action to protect <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fishery resources is needed because of lack of cooperation by other high-seas fishing nations under existing agreements. The resolution calls for the convening of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to impose a moratorium on all fishing in the zone, a ban which would stay in effect until an international fishery management agreement is negotiated. Because of its location, completely surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet territorial waters, the 4,500 square mile area is known variously as `` the hole in the doughnut'' or `` the doughnut.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has accused a group of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> residents of meting out `` frontier justice'' for chasing down and fatally beating a man accused of stealing $ 20. But four suspects charged with first - and second-degree manslaughter in the attack said they `` said they thought they had done the right thing, chasing and capturing this guy,'' said police Capt <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>. Police said at least four others may have been part of the group that beat 41-year-old <PERSON> Raymondo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carabello </PERSON> on Sunday after he allegedly snatched the money from a woman at a bakery. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> denounced the attackers Monday, saying they `` executed the death penalty without a trial.'' `` Here is a guy who, at worst, may have stolen $ 20,'' he said. `` No one would suggest that anybody be executed for stealing $ 20. ... They were meting out justice as they saw it, frontier justice. That's not permissible in civilized society.'' But some who live in the neighborhood expressed mixed feelings about the attack. `` It's not right that he got killed,'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, 23, said as he stood at the counter of a grocery store not far from the bakery. `` But I understand. That stuff's got to stop. ... People will think twice about stealing around here. It's kind of dangerous around here.'' The beating death occurred in front of the Jefferson Houses public housing project in an area of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> that has been plagued by crack dealers and violence. After being robbed in the bakery, the woman asked a crowd on the corner if they had seen the man who had just robbed her. <PERSON> Caraballo </PERSON> came out of the houses and the group chased him down the block. `` They started to beat him, -LRB- with -RRB- fists and feet,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` He was getting beaten all over, the legs, the ribs,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 27, who was in the area visiting a friend. `` He was yelling, ` Please stop! No more! no more!''' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` They said, ` We're going to kill you!''' said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s friend <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Augostini </PERSON>. The man staggered across the street and collapsed in front of <PERSON> Augostini </PERSON>'s building. Police broke up the fight and <PERSON> Caraballo </PERSON> stood up and was handcuffed, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. The officers radioed for an ambulance as they took him to their office. He was taken to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he died Sunday evening. Four hours later, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON>, 23, was arrested, police said. Three others surrendered Monday: <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andino </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mimms </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Isidore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadrado </PERSON>, 14, police Neither the suspects nor <PERSON> Caraballo </PERSON>, who lived nearby, have previous criminal records, police said. Needle marks on his arm suggested he was a drug addict, police said. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said the suspects apparently did not know each other and none of them knew <PERSON> Caraballo </PERSON>. The 14-year-old is being treated as an adult because of the seriousness of the crime. The $ 20 was not recovered.

 The rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> handily defeated the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in legislative and municipal elections this week, election officials announced. The defeat presented President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the staunchest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with the prospect of an uphill climb in his final year in office. Presidential elections are set for March 1989. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told journalists `` more than 50 percent'' of the votes cast on Sunday went to the alliance, known by its Spanish acronym of Arena. He declined to be more specific, saying complete returns would be ready shortly. The announcement Monday of a majority for <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> signaled a triumph even greater than the rightists had predicted. They had 13 deputies in the outgoing 60-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> controlled with 33 seats. Arena appeared assured of at least 31 seats in the new chamber. The party predicted it would have 35. Local media projected 33-35 seats for the rightists. The Christian Democrats were expected to get about 22 seats. Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla boycott call and threats of violence to cast ballots. The guerrillas said the elections were illegitimate, contending that free and fair elections could not be held in wartime. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sent <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> almost $ 600 million in military and economic aid last year, more than the amount given to any country in the hemisphere. Arena candidate <PERSON> Armado </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON>, a 39-year-old lawyer, won the mayor's race in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital and home to 1.5 million of the country's 5 million people. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> defeated <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the president's son <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> won most of the rest of the country's municipalities Arena benefited from a groundswell of popular discontent with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> won the presidency in 1984 on a platform of ending the war and improving the Salvadoran economy. The 8-year-old war continues, unemployment is estimated at 40 percent and annual inflation is estimated at nearly 40 percent. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s campaign slogan was `` Change for the Better.'' Arena President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who kept his assembly seat, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> his party would try to reach agreement on fundamental points with all parties represented in the legislature, including how to wage the war. `` If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said. He indicated that <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, which has considerable support and good connections with military officers, would work to step up offensives against the rebels. `` This low intensity conflict idea should be erased,'' he said, referring to smaller-scale, U.S.-backed counterinsurgency tactics that have been adopted by the Salvadoran army. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hailed <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s national elections and called them a strong victory for the democratic process Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., who led an observer team named by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, called the election honest and important `` because power transferred peacefully'' and `` the rebels did n't win <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, asked whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had any reservations about a rightist victory, said that `` we do n't choose sides in these kinds of elections.'' The fiercely nationalistic Arena was formed in 1981, with retired army Maj. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> its founder. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> has strongly criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is considered the driving force behind early 1980s death-squads.

 A quasi-governmental panel has recommended that wood-burning fireplaces be banned by 1994 to cut air pollution, but the proposal was attacked by home builders. `` You can ban woodburning, but you ca n't ban bricks and mortar,'' said <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Quenan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're going to have real trouble when people say, ` I want a fireplace in my new home.''' In its proposal Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee said that within five years all newly installed fireplaces should be fueled by natural gas and all existing wood-burning fireplaces be put out of service or converted to gas. The council will consider the ban on April 4. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> last year became the first state to require new wood-burning stoves to meet air-quality standards for carbon monoxide and particulates.

 Scientists have redesigned a potent natural poison so that it seeks out and kills cancer cells in the test tube, signaling a possible new route for fighting some tumors, a scientist says. The poison, so strong that a dose the size of a salt grain can kill a person, may be harnessed for fighting breast cancers that have spread elsewhere in the body, and some lung and brain tumors, according to <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The strategy takes advantage of the fact that some cancer cells display on their surface certain kinds of protein structures called receptors. Specific substances bind to each kind of receptor before they enter the cell. Normal cells have receptors too, but the new work focuses on receptors that are far more numerous on cancer cells, <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> told science writers at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Using genetic engineering, scientists essentially redesigned the gene that a common bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses to produce its potent poison, called an endotoxin. The bacteria can cause pink eye, bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. One portion of the endotoxin molecule seeks out normal cells and binds to them. Scientists deleted the portion of the gene responsible for creating that portion and substituted another, so that the endotoxin produced by the gene would seek out cancer cells instead. Then they put the altered gene into a second kind of bacterium and put it to work. The bacterium churned out multiple copies of the cancer-seeking version of the poison. <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> said Monday that scientists have experimented with two types of redesigned poison, each geared to a different receptor on cancer cells. One, the receptor for a hormone called interleukin-2, is found in high concentrations on white blood cells in a disease called adult T-cell leukemia, which is found chiefly in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> said. The other receptor binds either of two growth-stimulating substances, called epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor alpha. It is found in abundance in some lung cancer cells, breast cancer cells and brain tumors called glioblastomas, he said. Glioblastomas are untreatable now, <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> said. In test tube experiments, the redesigned poisons sought out and killed cancer cells while largely ignoring normal cells, he said. The poison works by entering a cell and sabotaging the cell's protein-making machinery <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> said such `` oncotoxins'' represent a step beyond a similar approach, which is attaching a poison to a protein called an antibody that seeks out cancer cells. That has been studied for some years, and <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> said the antibody approach is now being studied in four ovarian cancer patients at the cancer institute. Their doses are aimed at looking for side effects, and are too low to expect any effect against their tumors, he said. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON>, cancer society senior vice president for research, called <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON>'s new approach `` very promising.'' It may one day be able to circumvent a problem with the antibody system, that the body's immune system quickly recognizes the antibody-poison combination as foreign and tries to destroy it, he said.

 <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, considered one of the most influential postwar jazz orchestrators and composers, was remembered by <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> as a man who will be missed `` for always keeping time with the age he's in.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> died Sunday at age 75. `` Whatever new thing, new ideas come up, <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was right on top them,'' said <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> well but did not perform with him. `` He will be missed for having a very strong feeling for the soloist. He was tender. One of a kind.'' Trumpeter <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, whose musical collaboration with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> spanned 40 years, said, `` Whenever I had a question about the music, composing or which way to go, I would think about what <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> would do.

And he hung up.'' `` Miles Ahead,'' `` Birth of the Cool,'' `` Porgy and <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>'' and `` Sketches of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'' were albums <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> orchestrated for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who then was playing in his `` cool'' style. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> earlier had been an arranger for his own band, <PERSON> Skinnay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornhill </PERSON>, but became famous with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. He was considered one of jazz's greatest orchestrators, along with <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Dameron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> also arranged a collection of jazz classics for <PERSON> Cannonball </PERSON> <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON> and his own band's `` Out of the Cool,'' which were marvels of harmonic subtlety and originality.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tamil rebels armed with knives, swords and axes attacked two villages in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> early today and slashed 13 Sinhalese civilians to death, Sri Lankan military officials said. Three people, including a woman and two children, were reported hospitalized with serious injuries. The latest deaths raised to at least 125 the number of civilians slain in their villages since March 2. Most of the victims have been members of the Sinhalese majority community on the island, but 22 of the victims were minority Tamils killed in a reprisal raid on their community March 11. The military officials said today's attacks occurred shortly after midnight in the villages of <LOCATION> Pudukulam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madavuvaithakulam </LOCATION>. They lie just south of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, a town 130 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition their names not be used, said at least six children and two women were among the victims. They quoted police as blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> for the attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> militia, the largest of the Tamil rebel groups, has rejected an Indian-backed peace accord aimed at ending their nearly five-year separatist rebellion. Government officials have said the attacks on villages are aimed at disrupting a long-running government resettlement program for poor Sinhalese. Most of the slayings have occurred in the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, where the resettlement program has been having the greatest impact. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population They claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>, who control the government and military. Moderate Tamils want more autonomy for their communites in the north and east of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where they predominate, while militants are fighting for a separate nation. Sinhalese make up about 75 percent of the island's population. The rest are Moslems and descendants of early European colonizers. After the peace accord was signed last July, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to try to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' continuing campaign <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has become involved because it has more than 60 million ethnic Tamils in its own southern states who are sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors today began questioning top officials about allegations of fraud and influence peddling, and an opposition party charged that President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo aided massive corruption. The Central Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General's Office questioned six senior officials of the Saemaul Undong rural and urban development group and banned 26 people implicated in the investigation from leaving the country Prosecutor <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-il </PERSON> said officials of the home, agriculture and fisheries, education and sports ministries along with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> government officials were being investigated to see if they assisted fraud and corruption. A major scandal arose after the government began a probe into allegations that <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> and government officials embezzled millions of dollars, sold government patronage and forced businesses to make illegal donations over the past six years. An initial investigation revealed evidence of fraud and other crimes, including diversion of government and private subsidies and concealment by government officials to protect <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON>, prosecution officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police agency, had been asked to help track down and return top <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> official <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin-taek </PERSON> who fled the country last month, <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said. `` My investigation team will unearth all malpractices and make public the results of the probe,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, the younger brother of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and former head of <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION>, is one of the suspects under investigation. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Sunday after fleeing to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last week when knowledge of the probe became public. Prosecutors said they are investigating charges Saemaul officials used ties with the government to enrich themselves and government officials participated or covered up the corruption to protect the administration. While he was president, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> named his brother to head <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> is not being investigated in the scandal. The Party for Peace and Democracy, the country's second-largest opposition party, today charged that President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> aided <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION> officials involved in corruption when he was home minister in 1982. The party demanded that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> be investigated by prosecutors and said it would conduct its own probe. The <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> presidential office and prosecutors had no immediate response to the party's allegations. Former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who left office Feb. 25 at the end of a seven-year term, left Monday on a private visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during which he is to meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a powerful figure while his brother was in office, resigned last year after being linked to gangsters who staged a bloody underworld struggle for power. He indicated Monday there had been irregularities within <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION> but gave no details. <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON>, a semi-private organization that worked closely with government agencies, was formed in 1971 to improve urban and rural living standards. Projects ranged from building model communities to organizing city dwellers to keep streets clean. Critics contend <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON>, which has offices across the country, worked over the years with successive authoritarian governments by promoting government interests and organizing support. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who help put President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> in power with military backing in 1980, promised during election campaigns late last year to probe any official corruption under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected on Dec. 16. Political sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government started the Saemaul probe to discredit the former president, who has tried to retain influence within the government. Several top <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> supporters were quietly dropped from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last week. But some government officials and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are concerned the Saemaul probe could blacken the reputation of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government because of its close ties to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. The party also is worried the investigation could hurt its chances in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections next month.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>'s ready-to-wear show featured such splendid finesse in details and fabrics that it should be called haute couture. Famous for his tailoring, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> outdid himself in Monday's show Suits and dresses with jackets hugged the body and lean skirts were just above the knee. Waists were always small, and shoulders had enough padding for outline. Jackets included diagonally-striped suede numbers in russet, ochre and purple with pompons at wrists and bodices. A handsome raft of gray suits in plaids, stripes and checks had turned-up and buttoned jacket hems. Boxy or fitted short alpaca coats in beige or bright colors or pastel plaid capes were the only cover-ups to the fancy suit display. The wrapped checked or black leather suits were crisscrossed with black bands and bows, which also appeared on evening wear. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> also fooled around with wool ropes for piping on black and white suits. For evening wear, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> included satin rosettes and flowers, intricate lace patterns on blouses, brocade galore in both trousers and skirts. At <LOCATION> Balmain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> also showed sophisticated short looks with the couture attention to detail, though the whole line was simpler than <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>'s. There were new bolero-topped trouser suits in bright houndstooth checks with fullish tops on the pants. In jewel tones, the slim knit sheaths with their triple-pleated bands at the hip were pared-down elegance, while other outfits showed the couture touch with diagonal rays of heavy welt seaming. The long pleated knit dinner skirts were applauded for their easy wearability. Like <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> at Dior aimed for ladylike lines and fabrics, with not much except color to rock the boat. <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> kept to a basic daytime theme of blouson jackets with raglan sleeves over a narrow, knee-baring skirt. Dazzling coats topped some of the short, bright suits, as other suits were paired with brightly-striped puffy marabou jackets _ a big trend for the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> touch next winter. Flowered and satin-trimmed cocktail sheaths and suits also came out in black velvet. Though <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON>'s late-day wear was usually dressed-up and sophisticated, he also showed flowered long or short sweaters over fuchsia or emerald flowing satin culottes for an informal at-home evening.

<HEAD>Over 9,000 Murders in Soviet Union Last Year, Radio Moscow Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 9,000 murders were committed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, but some types of major crimes declined due to the Kremlin's campaign against drinking and drugs, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported. The state-run radio's report, in news bulletins on its international English-language service, was believed to be the first time the Soviets have made public a comprehensive annual statistic for murders nationwide. For years, the Soviets used to contend that their society had less crime than Western countries, but issued sparse statistics. Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> report was clearly linked to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for `` glasnost,'' or more openness on some issues, that has brought franker reporting on the country's social problems `` Last year, slightly over 9,000 murders were registered in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, which is one third less than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said, citing preliminary statistics. It did not say where the figures for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homicides were obtained. Official statistics for last year have not yet been issued. In 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, there were 20,613 murders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up 8.6 percent from 18,976 in 1985. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said there was a drop last year in the incidence of some types of major crime in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but gave no details. It quoted a Soviet legal expert, Dr. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpets </PERSON>, as crediting the `` positive role of the anti-drinking and anti-drug drive'' launched under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the decline in some crimes. However, there was no decrease last year in crimes against property, such as burglaries, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said, without providing data. This year, police in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have begun issuing weekly reports through the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency on the number of murders, rapes and other crimes committed in the capital. Soviet officials are also working on a revision of the country's criminal code

<HEAD>Government Closes Anti-Apartheid Newspaper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today shut down a militant anti-apartheid newspaper for 12 weeks, contending the church-backed New Nation threatened public safety. A special decree issued by Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said further issues of the black-oriented weekly newspaper are `` totally prohibited'' through June 10. He acted a day after the newspaper, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, lost a court appeal seeking to forestall government action while it challenged state-of-emergency censorship regulations. Technically, the New Nation could resume publication after three months, but <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> could close it again if its contents dissatisfied him. The paper's senior staff has not announced whether operations will be resumed after the suspension. With a circulation of 50,000 to 60,000, the 2-year-old newspaper is the largest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to devote virtually its entire content, including sports and entertainment sections, to politically-related developments. The newspaper had a full-time staff of 22 and employed 32 correspondents who covered anti-apartheid activity in the rural areas where the majority of blacks live. Several employees already had resigned in anticipation of closure by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who disclosed his intentions in January. The newspaper's editor, <PERSON> Zwelakhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, has been detained without charge for 16 months. He joined the New Nation after a year as a <ORGANIZATION> Niemann </ORGANIZATION> fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities have banned four of the paper's editions and seized two. Police have raided the paper's offices, and it was the first of six publications warned by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that they could be closed for three-month periods or censored for publishing material he found objectionable. State-of-emergency regulations give <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> nearly unlimited powers to deal with newspapers he feels might contribute to unrest. He does not have to give reasons for his actions. The New Nation lost an initial court challenge of the regulations and intends to pursue its case in an appellate court. But on Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the newspaper's bid to prevent closure during the appeal process. The New Nation's acting editor, <PERSON> Gabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tugwana </PERSON>, said closure of his paper would be `` an action against the whole media.'' `` There are many more axes hanging in the air that will fall on many others,'' he said, referring to warnings issued by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to other publications. In a warning letter to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> cited several items which he said threatened public safety, promoted revolution, enhanced the image of outlawed organizations or fomented hostility toward the security forces. The items he listed included: _ A picture of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, president of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, opening a new office in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> _ A story about an arson attack on the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest anti-apartheid coalition _ A picture of relatives of condemned blacks at a news conference in which they appealed for clemency for 32 men and women sentenced to hang _ An advertisement quoting a Psalm and urging the government to abolish torture

 Baton-wielding riot police scuffled with hundreds of demonstrators protesting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and arrested about 275 people at federal buildings in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, supporters of continued aid to the Nicaraguan Contras waved signs that read, `` Contras Yes, Commies No'' and `` Stop The Russians Before They Reach Our Borders.'' About 150 people on opposite sides of the issue gathered for peaceful rallies in front of the federal courthouse. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a yelling, sign-toting crowd of more than 500 people encircled the Federal Building early Monday. Helmeted police arrested 225 people. Shortly after the protest began at 7 a.m. Monday, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police began making arrests for blocking entrances and the streets around the 20-story building. The main entrance was closed, and for about a half-hour the protesters blocked the rear entrance that police were trying to keep open. More than 5,000 people work in the building. Some demonstrators held aloft a 6-foot-long sign reading, `` This building closed for renovation of morals.'' Many held signs insulting to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and shouted obscenities. Protesters shouted `` No Contra aid'' and `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, out of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' as they marched in a ragged oval in front of the closed main entrance, while early arrivals for work got in through the back doors. At one point, screaming protesters swarmed against a lawyer trying to get in. Police fought the demonstrators aside and pulled the man through. Officers with visored helmets and batons marched on the double from one street to another as protesters harassed them with quick moves. Some protesters went limp and were dragged screaming to the police vans. A man in his early 20s who did n't move fast enough for charging police was hit in the mouth with a baton and bloodied. The demonstators were photographed and booked on the street before being taken to the Hall of Justice for formal citations. Police, moving in with batons chest-high, began rounding up demonstrators after police Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> warned the hooting crowd through a loudspeaker that they were illegally assembled and ordered them to disperse. Some were charged with resisting arrest. In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, riot police arrested about 50 protesters Monday after they marched through downtown to the Federal Building, broke a window and threw paint. Officers used 4-foot-long sticks to keep the crowd under control, arrested demonstrators and dragged those who would n't go peacefully to police vans. Officers also ripped some banners down and tore them up, and used dogs to keep the streets clear. Some protesters said the police used excessive force. `` I moved out of the street real fast,'' said protester <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, 52. `` The police obviously were looking for violence. In my opinion the police incited the violence.'' But Police Chief <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said the officers' actions were necessary. `` There's a limit to how much you can tolerate. It was getting worse,'' <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> replaced nearly half his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and appointed more than a dozen military men in their place in a shake-up he said will bring new blood to the government. `` The new Cabinet will ensure the continuation of past policies as well as tackle the problem of regeneration -LRB- of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s leadership -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> said after announcing the new lineup on television Monday Among those replaced were Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardhana </PERSON>, Mines and Energy Minister <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mochtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusumaatmadja </PERSON>. Veteran Finance Minister Radius Prawiro, 59, will be sworn in Wednesday to succeed <PERSON> Wardhana </PERSON> as economic czar, officials said. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s largest debtor and <PERSON> Wardhana </PERSON> last month said <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> had no intention of rescheduling its $ 42.1 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Wardhana </PERSON>, a 60-year-old civilian technocrat credited with helping to restore the economy in the last 20 years, said privately for some time that he wished to retire, diplomatic sources said. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, who held the key energy portfolio for 10 years, is being replaced by Col. <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON>, 47, a Japan-trained former head of the national investment board. He is regarded by foreign businessmen as a tough negotiator. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s economy remains heavily dependent on oil and natural gas exports and <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> represented the only Asian member of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> deliberations and once served as head of the cartel. The new foreign minister is <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, 55, who was ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Among <PERSON> Mochtar </PERSON>'s unfinished business are ambitions to play host to the next non-aligned summit and be recognized as a leader of the Third World. <PERSON> Mochtar </PERSON>, 59, who leaves the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> job after 12 years, spearheaded his country's efforts to project itself on the world stage after years of playing a minor role. As expected, Gen. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdani </PERSON>, 55, replaced last month as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was named defense minister. <PERSON> Murdani </PERSON> has long been regarded as one of the country's most powerful figures. Only 18 ministers of the previous 40-member Cabinet were given assignments in the new one which has 41. In addition to <PERSON> Murdani </PERSON> and the new armed forces chief, Gen. Try Sutrisno, 53, who also holds Cabinet rank, 11 other active or retired military officers were appointed. They included Gen. <PERSON> Rudini </PERSON>, 58, as Home Affairs Minister and Admiral <PERSON> Sudomo </PERSON>, 61, as Political and Security Minister, both of whom are retired. <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, 66, rules the world's fifth most populous nation _ 147 million in 1980 _ with the backing of the armed forces. The retired general, who is starting his fifth five-year term, took power in 1965 following the abortive communist coup. He is the third longest-ruling leader in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>.

 Authorities searched today for a teen-ager who fled his family's apartment moments after letting his aunt inside, where she found four family members dead in a bathtub, police said. The bodies of <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 45; his wife, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, 23, who was four months pregnant; and their children, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, 9 months, and <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON>, 6, were discovered Monday morning, police said. Autopsies determined that <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> died of suffocation and strangulation and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> died from a skull fracture after being struck with a blunt object, said Dr. <PERSON> Halbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillinger </PERSON>, assistant medical examiner. Autopsies were still being conducted on <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and his wife, authorities said. According to radio station KYW-AM, each was shot once in the head. The bodies of the two adults were discovered in the tub Monday morning. The two children's bodies were underneath them and went unnoticed until several hours later, when their parents' bodies were removed, police said. There was no water in the tub. Authorities were looking for <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 17, who is <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s son by a previous marriage in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, for questioning. `` We do n't know what his role in the crime is,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON>. `` We are trying to locate him to question him to find out what happened here.'' The youth was taken out of school Monday by an aunt who became worried when she was unable to contact the family, police said. When she went to the family's second-floor apartment with the boy, he let her in, then fled, police and family members said. `` <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> told her that he knew where the family was,'' said <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, Sr., the slain man's father. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> went with her and opened the door `` but as soon as he opened the apartment, he was away and gone.'' A relative saw <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> run to a car and drive off Monday morning, police said. The woman told a neighbor she saw a bloody knife on the front seat of the car as the teen drove away. She said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> refused to answer her questions. The four had apparently been dead at least two or three days, <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said.

 Police detained scores of people in anti-government protests in two cities that featured dolls with dark glasses resembling those worn by Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, opposition spokesmen said. Opposition activists in the southwest city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> said hundreds of people assembled on a main street Monday demanding freedom for <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fydrych </PERSON>, head of the satirical street theater group, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION>. Police in the port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Sunday detained 18 members of a banned peace group who planned to throw an effigy with dark spectacles into the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, an opposition activist said. Participants on Monday chanted `` Spring in, Fydrych out!'' while carrying three `` Marzanna'' dolls with dark glasses, activists said. The dolls were related to the Polish folk custom of drowning `` Marzanna,'' a rag-and-stick figure representing winter, on the first day of spring. Fydrych is serving a two-month jail sentence for organizing similar demonstrations in the past. The demonstration on Monday drew 3,000 spectators, said activist <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON>. Police at first checked IDs, but then began hauling the protesters away, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON> and an Orange Alternative member, <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Albin </PERSON>, said police later used tear gas and struck people with truncheons. Another activist, <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, said he could not confirm the report. <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said 150 people were detained, most briefly. Mrs. <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> said the number was higher. A police duty officer in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> said he knew nothing about any demonstrations. <PERSON> Janina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehrstein </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Freedom and Peace group in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said the 18 people detained in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> on Sunday planned to toss a dark-spectacled doll from a pier into the Baltic on Monday. Five of the 18 were released after a few hours, but the others were held overnight at a police station, she said. Freedom and Peace opposes <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s universal military draft and demands alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors.

<TEXT>
 An unprecedented number of dissidents and intellectuals from six East European nations have signed an appeal for recognition of the right to object to military service. The appeal, published Monday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, was signed by 77 Soviets, including <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, nuclear physicist and 1975 Nobel Peace laureate. The signatories from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> called for recognition `` of citizens' right to conscientious objection and alternative service.'' The appeal was addressed to the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which has been meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> since November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords on military security, economic coopertion and humanitarian issues. The appeal asked the delegations to work toward an agreement on the right not to serve in the military. Hungarian dissident writer <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>, who signed the appeal and helped initiate it, told a news conference Monday that conscientious objection was one of the main reasons for political imprisonment in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Hundreds of our East European compatriots are sent to prison because of their non-violent conscientious stands,'' the appeal said. `` These young men would like to serve the community by caring for the old and sick instead of performing military service.'' <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said no country in the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allows its citizens the right to object to military service, while <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries do. `` Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> punishes people for not wanting to look at other countries as enemies,'' he said. <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said 438 people and groups have signed the appeal so far. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which helped coordinate collecting signatures, said in a news release it was the first time a large number of Soviet citizens joined a joint East bloc initiative. <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said the appeal, the fourth such joint effort of East European dissidents, carried the largest number of signatures so far. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>, a member of the Czechoslovak human rights group Charter 77, was invited to come to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for presentation of the appeal. However, in a letter read in part at the news conference and then distributed, <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> complained that `` no Czechoslovak citizens, including those who have passports, could go to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in response to your invitation.'' His letter said, `` Internationalization of our demands ... is also very important because it provides a comparison between the legal and factual state of affairs prevailing in the individual East European countries.'' Dissidents in East bloc countries estimated the total number of people in prison for objecting to military service at about 300 to 400.

 Three former <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees who won a $ 75 million personal injury award say they hope to give $ 67.5 million to six institutions to help others who suffer from exposure to asbestos. `` We are making these donations as our best effort to try to help our fellow asbestos victims, as well as to help assure that this kind of abuse of public trust will never happen again,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 55, one of the victims and spokesman for the group, said Monday. <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elkton </LOCATION>, Md.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 74, of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaster </PERSON>, 71, of the <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> area said the money would be donated if the damage award is upheld on appeal. In November, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury ordered <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Trumbull </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to pay the men and their wives punitive damages for conspiring to hide the health hazards of asbestos. Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> has yet to decide whether to uphold the award. If it is upheld, <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> plans to appeal, according to <PERSON> LeGrande </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. Even if it is upheld, <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON> said he realizes the award may never be paid for several reasons, including the fact there are still 350 asbestos-related cases pending against <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, and last week a mistrial was declared in a trial in which <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to pay $ 22 million to two other former <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> employees. If <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> upholds the $ 75 million, <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON> said it could force <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy. `` This way, someone will get something. We're not trying to hog it all. If we force them into -LRB- bankruptcy -RRB-, it will at least go to charity,'' <PERSON> Kapp </PERSON> said. `` On the question of bankruptcy, that's a possibility,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Raymark </ORGANIZATION> does not have $ 75 million, but does have more than that in insurance, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hazards </ORGANIZATION>, a toxic victims advocacy group based in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was earmarked for $ 13 million of the award.

<TEXT>
 Actors in television and radio commercials set aside script lines for picket lines, launching the second day of the second strike to hit the entertainment industry this month. `` We are now officially on strike against the producers of television and radio commericals. ... No new negotiations are scheduled,'' said a spokesman on a taped hotline recording today at the Screen Actors Guild. The 100,000 joint members of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> called their strike Monday against the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION>. The union rejected a management offer of immediate fee increases in exchange for dropping a cost-of-living adjustment, and advertisers refused to accept a proposed `` tiered'' pay system for cable TV commercials based on the number of cable subscribers. The strike, which affects only radio and television commercials, is the second by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> talent unions in less than a month. The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> has entered the third week of its walkout against motion picture and television producers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinn </PERSON>, the chief management negotiator, urged advertising companies to hire non-union talent, but some companies said they would wait out the strike before beginning new ad campaigns. `` The ads with non-union actors just wo n't look as good. It will be a lot like the replacement players who filled in during the football strike,'' said one advertising executive, who asked not to be named. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising firm <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Femina </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travisano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it probably will hold off on new ads for one of its major clients, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION>. Actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leisure </PERSON>, who plays the part of outrageous liar <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Isuzu </PERSON>, is a guild member. The striking actors on Monday picketed offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mather </ORGANIZATION> agency in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, strikers set up picket lines at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> during a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> board meeting. Pickets also walked in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsatti </PERSON>, SAG's national executive secretary, sent telegrams to the major candidates asking them to use only ads with union actors by signing interim agreements with the unions. <PERSON> McGuinn </PERSON>, however, said the advertising companies `` do n't see any problem during a strike.'' `` We're producing commercials today; we're producing commercials tomorrow,'' he said. `` We have non-union talent that's willing to work. Our doors are open.'' Meanwhile, there were no talks scheduled between the 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the producers' alliance to end that strike. However, a guild spokesman said scriptwriters are ready to return to the bargaining table. Scriptwriters have demanded higher fees from foreign distribution, more creative control and a management proposal to restructure fees for one-hour television shows sold into syndication.

<HEAD>Girl Returning Home, Apparently Free Of Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A girl who became the first cancer patient to receive a bone-marrow transplant through a computerized national registry apparently is free of leukemia, hospital officials say. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 7, will return home Saturday to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Recent tests have found no cancer and, at 100 days, her operation at <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is considered a success. One thing <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> apparently wo n't miss is the attention that accompanied publicity for the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry, based in Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> `` Mommy,'' <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> complained, holding out her arms to mother <PERSON> Margurite </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> as a reporter and photographer approached. `` Not this again.'' `` The reason we agreed to the media coverage is that we wanted people to know about the registry,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` We wanted people to know a bone marrow transplant could be done with a non-related donor.'' The registry located <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, whose tissue type matched <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>'s. The transplant was performed Dec. 16. `` She's doing fine,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I just feel <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> is going to make it. She's already beaten the odds.'' Another piece of the story is fund-raising _ a tough job without news coverage. Bone-marrow transplants like <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>'s cost an average of $ 100,000, and fund-raising for her treatment began even before the registry match. The family is covered by private insurance for 80 percent of the transplant costs. Fund-raising was still necessary to cover the expenses of moving to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, loss of income or any further medical costs. `` Without the media coverage it would have been real hard to raise the money,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` There are a lot of people who ca n't get a transplant because they ca n't get funds,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>. The non-profit cancer center is prohibited from doing fund-raising for individuals.

<TEXT>
 Serious legal problems have blocked the extradition of a former Argentine general accused of overseeing mass kidnappings and murder during his country's military rule in the 1970s. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanides </PERSON> on Monday acknowledged that the five-year deadline under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law for charging <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> with the 23 kidnappings already has expired. Zanides blames <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> for `` a systematic pattern of abduction, torture and murder'' by his troops in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> during the military rule of the late 1970s. Zanides urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> to apply <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law in the extradition hearings, under which the kidnappings could still be prosecuted. But under questioning from <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zanides </PERSON> conceded that there was no precedent for such a ruling. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 63, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> from 1976 to 1978, is charged separately with the murders of 43 people, mostly prisoners, by his troops during the so-called `` dirty war'' against suspected leftists. After serving as head of the joint chiefs of staff and the state-run oil monopoly, he fled when a civilian government came to power in 1983. He was arrested in January 1986 at his home in <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and is being held without bail. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> is expected to rule on the extradition later. After a hearing that lasted nearly all day, he called a recess until April 6 and indicated he may rule then. The judge ruled favorably for the prosecution on one issue, refusing to admit testimony aimed at showing that the charges and extradition were politically motivated because President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, an opponent of the former military government, promised to prosecute generals during his campaign in 1983. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s lawyers argue he was not responsible for his soldiers' actions and that the actions were `` political,'' and therefore exempt from extradition under the treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

 When 18 - to 44-year-old Americans were asked which leaders they admired most in the past 20 years, they picked two men who were assassinated 20 years ago _ <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> Thirty-eight percent of those responding to the poll conducted for <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine said they admired King the most, citing his stand on civil rights. The respondents who chose King and the 25 percent who chose second-place <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said they were eloquent leaders who stood for peace, justice, tolerance and equality. The magazine noted that both politicians were assassinated before realizing their dreams and that their `` blighted legacy'' is a theme that surfaces throughout the survey. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was also chosen as most admired by 25 percent of those surveyed, but he also had a high negative rating _ 10 percent picked him as the public figure they respected the least. Asked under what circumstances they would enlist for military service, 60 percent of all respondents and 73 percent of men said they would enlist if war broke out on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> continent. Only 27 percent said they would enlist if our close <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies were attacked. Twenty-five percent of all respondents and 15 percent of the men said they would not join the military under any circumstances. Twelve percent said politics was very important in their lives, 41 percent said somewhat important, 30 percent not very important, 16 percent not at all important and one percent were not sure. The survey found that 48 percent of respondents believe families need two incomes in order to survive. Results from the poll, conducted last September by <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, appear in the April 7 issue of the magazine which went on sale today. The poll is based on interviews with 816 respondents at their homes, the magazine said.

 A pre-dawn fire that apparently started when a cigarette ignited a mattress swept through part of a suburban hotel today, killing four guests and injuring seven others, police said. A 7-year-old child and a handicapped man were among the dead at the four-story Hotel Tivoli in the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Laken </LOCATION>. Of the seven people injured, two were in serious condition, said a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the identities of the victims were not yet known but said three of the victims were Africans. Police said the fire was most probably caused when someone's cigarette ignited a mattress on the second floor A police patrol noticed the fire minutes after it started at 3:30 a.m. and immediately warned emergency services. Police and neighbors meanwhile rescued people while awaiting the firefighters, the official said. One guest was hospitalized with injuries after jumping from the second floor. Another guest was found unconscious in his room and also was hospitalized. The fire swept through half of the fully-booked hotel, causing about $ 57,000 in damage, police said.

 A pair of bachelor brothers who quietly amassed a small fortune left more than $ 1.5 million to the high school they attended more than 70 years ago. For most of this century, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Simionescu </PERSON> lived quietly together in a modest way but the brothers, who lived into their 90s, amassed a fortune through shrewd investments in stocks and bonds. They left all their money _ estimated at more than $ 1.5 million after taxes _ to <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for a college-scholarship endowment `` This was really a drop out of the blue,'' said principal <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who, like his colleagues, never heard of the Simionescus until after they died in 1986, three months apart. `` It totally surprised us. What should I say? It's like manna.'' Neither <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, a machinist, nor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, a stamp collector who was confined to a wheelchair because of a teen-age bout with polio, ever went to college. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> in 1904, and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> followed five years later, but they were never big boosters after graduating. `` They wanted to do something that would have some longevity to it. I think they wanted to help young people,'' said their lawyer, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmartin </PERSON>. The brothers had investments _ some dating back to the 1920s _ in dozens of companies, ranging from <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> died in 1986 of heart failure, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>'s health was failing, and he was never told his brother was dead. But he kept asking for <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> died three months later, also of heart failure. Their bequest should provide more than $ 100,000 in scholarships a year.

 Israeli troops shot and killed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> during a clash with protesters hurling rocks, metal bars and bottles, an army spokeswoman said today. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the body of another <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> was found in an orchard in the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The army denied involvement in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> death, but a resident of the village said the man's family believed he had been beaten by soldiers. His skull was crushed. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army spokeswoman said an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>'s body was found this morning after a Monday night clash in Tubas, a village 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The Arab-owned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified the man as 26-year-old <PERSON> Hikmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Drajmeh </PERSON>. The agency said troops shot and wounded two more protesters, one of them seriously, but the army denied the report. The spokeswoman, who could not be identified under army regulations, said the clash erupted when hundreds of Palestinians attacked an army patrol with rocks, metal bars and bottles. `` The soldiers shot to extricate themselves from a life-threatening situation,'' she said. The killing brought the Palestinian death toll to 107 in almost four months of unrest, according to unofficial <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> gunfire. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said no troops had been in Beit Hanoun Monday and so the army could not have been involved. A resident said the victim's family suspected the army was responsible because the body was found in an isolated area off limits to villagers. A third Palestinian died today when he was shot from a passing car in the southern <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> by assailants assumed to be Arabs, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said. An army spokesman said the motive was apparently criminal. Both <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> killings were turned over to the police, the army said. But <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> police officials were quoted by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio as saying they were unable to investigate many crimes due to the mass resignations last week of 380 Arab officers. The officers resigned along with most of their Arab colleagues in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in accordance with orders issued by underground leaders of what Palestinians call `` the uprising.'' In other casualties today, officials at the <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said two men were admitted with injuries inflicted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. In other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> unrest, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> driver fired shots near the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> after his car was stoned, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. There were no injuries. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, members of two <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> councils resigned today a day after an underground leaflet called for Israeli-appointed municipal officials to leave their jobs. Palestinian leaders also called for increased attacks with stones, firebombs and iron bars on Israeli security forces and Jewish settlers. The call came as several center-left <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politicians and writers joined right-wing leaders in demanding tougher measures to quell the violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Monday, the army issued a new regulation that will allow the detention of any security prisoner for up to six months with less judicial review. The previous edict required a military judge to review each case within 96 hours. Officials said the new regulation would ease the overload on the military court system that has handled nearly 3,000 cases since the violent demonstrations began in the occupied lands on Dec. 8. And Israeli troops on Monday expanded their search for weapons in the occupied lands following the fatal shooting Sunday of Israeli Sgt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> lifted restrictions barring soldiers from shooting at rioters throwing firebombs and for the first time the army destroyed the homes of three Arabs suspected of throwing such missiles. The increasing violence in the occupied lands drew demands for action from Israelis usually opposed to the measures of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, a legislator from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> on Monday: `` The political echelon must understand we can not continue with the policy of restraint. There is a time to hold back and a time to attack. The time has come for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to respond with force.''

Patients who received the experimental therapy showed a 63 percent survival rate five years after cancer surgery, compared with 33 percent for patients who received no treatment after surgery, said <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's come off very well,'' <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> said Monday after describing results to science writers at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> symposium. Surgery to remove lung cancer tumors often leaves cancer cells behind. In the new treatment, patients were injected after surgery with proteins drawn from other lung cancer tumors. Those antigens helped the body defend against cancer cells left behind by surgery, <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> said. Other cancer experts said they were impressed but added that more work was needed. For early-stage cancer, `` it looks like it's going to give people at least a 50 percent chance of being around five years later,'' while other post-surgical treatment does little good, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minton </PERSON>, professor of surgical oncology at the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` The problem is, it's small numbers,'' he said of the trial, which included 81 patients. `` It looks good, but we need more numbers.'' Any time such a jump in survival rates can be demonstrated, `` you've got to be impressed,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON>, senior cancer society vice president for research. But he said that as with any such finding, he wants to see another group of researchers achieve the same success to confirm the effectiveness of the therapy. <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> said the results are part of a 234-patient study that recently reported five-year survival rates of 69 percent in the treated group and 49 percent in the untreated group. Lung cancer is the nation's leading cancer killer, every year striking 152,000 Americans and killing 139,000. Only about 30 percent of lung cancer cases at most are diagnosed as early in their progression as the cases in the study, <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON> said. The cancers in the 81 patients were confined to the lung tissue or spread only to nearby lymph nodes, representing so-called stages 1 and 2. In later stages, cancer spreads elsewhere in the body. All the patients went through surgery to remove cancerous tissue. The experimental therapy began about two weeks later, <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> said. Once a month for three months, they were injected with doses of proteins called antigens that had been purified from other lung cancer tumors. The injections spurred the immune system into raising defenses aimed at cells bearing the same kinds of antigens. So the body was primed to `` mop up'' cancer cells missed by the surgery, <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> said. Fifty-three patients received the experimental therapy with injections in one or both arms, while the untreated 28 patients were simply followed for comparison purposes. Side effects were limited to a slight fever overnight and skin irritation at the injection sites, <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> said. Standard treatment after surgery often involves just waiting to see if any further cancer crops up, said <PERSON> Minton </PERSON>. Radiation is sometimes used, but `` the five-year results are terrible. They're like you did n't get much treatment at all. Chemotherapeutic drugs do not help either, said <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, head of the division of thoracic surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said previous attempts at immune system-based therapy had not met with such success. But he said a potential weak point in the study was the mixing of stage 1 and stage 2 patients, because they have such different natural five-year survival rates, respectively of more than 60 percent and about 30 percent or less. <PERSON> Hollinshead </PERSON> replied that patients were assigned randomly to treatment or the non-treatment groups, so that those two groups remained comparable.

 Foreign ministers from Moslem countries today condemned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` oppressive measures'' against rioters in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The ministers of the 46-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that `` all Moslems in the world are proud of this uprising.'' They called for political and financial aid for the rebellion. A <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking just before a plenary meeting at which the foreign ministers approved the statement, hailed the support they were giving to the `` uprising.'' In another development, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> in a closed committee session claimed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was facilitating the emigration of Iranian Jews to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied the charge. Jordanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were unlikely to negotiate on peace during the <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> meeting, in part because of the low-ranking level of the Iranian delegation. The ministers in their statement said the conference `` denounces the oppressive and criminal measures by the -LRB- Israeli -RRB- authorities against our brothers, the people in the occupied territories.'' `` Members of the organization are concerned to support Palestinians financially, politically and morally and also to back their sole legitimate representative, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. It did not elaborate on the form this aid would take. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s political department, the equivalent of the organization's foreign ministry, said the ministers' backing was especially valuable `` for the people inside the territories.'' He spoke the day after King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, in an opening address at the conference, called for the Moslem world to support the `` uprising.'' More than 100 Palestinians have died in the violent protests in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied in the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, who is heading the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s delegation at the Islamic meeting, condemned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moves to close the guerrilla group's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, accredited to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will keep the office open until <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police come and seal it off,'' he said. `` Then we will go to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- enclave -RRB- and live there.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, reading in a closed session a statement that was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by a source close to the conference, said the alleged help given to Iranian Jews for emigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was `` a violation of the rules of the'' organization. He did not elaborate, but asked the organization to study this issue from all sides. `` How come <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which claims to support the Palestinian issue and the uprising, is helping Jews to migrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He provided no figures on the migration. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has already denied the charge.

<HEAD>Honolulu's Mayor Moves To Crack Down On Japanese Investment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> has proposed legislation to stop foreign investors from purchasing some kinds of property in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, saying the measure would put an end to skyrocketing housing and real estate costs. The mayor on Monday sent a bill to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> that would ban the sale of residential, agricultural or preservation land to non-Americans. The bill does not cover commercial, resort and industrial properties. The mayor's move comes as the state attempts to deal with a recent wave of foreign investment that has caused property values to jump in some areas. The investment has been spurred by the fall of the dollar's value against the Japanese yen. `` What has triggered my action is the Japanese buyer with his cheap dollars,'' <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` They have been buying homes in several areas of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, forcing values to unprecedented levels.'' <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> said he does not consider his move protectionist. `` I believe in free and open trade between most countries,'' <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> said. `` But I also believe in fairness, and what I see happening here is not fair to Americans.'' A spokesman for state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON>'s bill was under review and may be included in the legislative agenda The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is considering a number of bills to curb Japanese investment and ease the property tax burden on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> homeowners.

<HEAD>Police Report Widespread Unrest During Protest Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two blacks were killed, seven injured and 39 arrested during a nationwide protest strike that brought the most extensive violence this year, police reported today. Dozens of buses, delivery vans and private cars were stoned or firebombed on Monday, the 28th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> massacre, and in many cases security forces used tear gas, rubber bullets, birdshot and dogs to disperse rioters, police headquarters said. Police said the two deaths and five of the injuries resulted from attacks by blacks on blacks. Two blacks were injured by police. Several of those arrested were trying to prevent children from going to school and workers from going to work, police said. The protest strike was organized by anti-apartheid activists in defiance of emergency regulations barring calls for such actions. Hundreds of thousands of black workers and students stayed away from jobs and classes, both to mark the anniversary of the 1960 police shootings of 69 blacks in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> and to protest the recent bannings of black opposition groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> said class boycotts were reported at 694 of the black schools under its control, 9 percent of the total. The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the country's largest daily newspaper, said protest strikes would continue `` as long as grievances are not directly addressed.'' `` Instead of tension being relieved through the extension of rights and the removal of restrictions, each new round of protests is met with further clamps which inevitably lead to fresh protests.'' Five students from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> went to local police headquarters today with a bunch of roses for <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the president of the student council who was detained under state-of-emergency regulations Monday. The students said a police lieutenant refused to accept the bouquet and told them: `` This is a police station, not a hospital.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a law student, was taken from her parents' home at dawn Monday. Police have not commented on the detention. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, the gynecologist who pioneered the test - tube baby technique that made parenthood possible for thousands of otherwise infertile couples, has died at age 74 A family announcement today said <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> had been suffering from cancer. He died Monday night in the <LOCATION> Chaucer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>, 62 miles southeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> continued working until recently despite deteriorating health, his longtime partner, physiologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, said. `` It is a very great loss to <ORGANIZATION> Bourn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- their clinic -RRB- and to me personally,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` In the last three years he was working under considerable difficulties, but carried on.'' Together, <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> were responsible for the world's first test tube baby, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, born at <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on July 25, 1978 The announcement of the birth of the healthy baby from an embryo fertilized outside her mother's womb caused shock waves at the time. The test-tube baby technique, known as in vitro fertilization, has since been used in clinics around the world. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s birth was hailed as a miracle by some and criticized as a wrong use of scientific techniques by others, including the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> avoided the controversy. `` I am not a wizard or a Frankenstein,'' he said. `` All I want to do is to help women whose child-producing mechanism is slightly faulty.'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, now a schoolgirl, was conceived after an egg was removed from her mother, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, and fertilized outside the womb with the sperm of her husband, truck driver <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Returned to the womb, the embryo developed a normal pregnancy. In their early years of research in the late 1960s and early 1970s, <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> were ostracized by much of the medical establishment and once turned down for a <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> grant. But that changed after <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s birth. Last year, <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> were made Commanders of the British Empire, and <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> also received one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest academic honors and was made a Fellow of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. In vitro fertilization was devised mainly to relieve infertility in women with blocked or damaged Fallopian tubes _ the normal site of conception. Under the procedure, ova are removed from the woman and fertilized with the prospective father's sperm in a laboratory dish. Resulting embryos _ often more than one _ then are implanted in the womb. Some embryos are now frozen for later use. There have been thousands of babies born worldwide to otherwise infertile couples as a result of in vitro fertilization. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, who was born June 9, 1913, qualified as a doctor in 1939 and immediately went into World War II service as a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surgeon. He was a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from 1941 to 1943, and was demobilized with the rank of Surgeon Lieutenant Commander in 1946. He worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals, moving in 1951 to <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>, a grimy northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city where in the fall of 1967 he teamed up with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> physiologist. They formed a trusted friendship and set up a research laboratory at <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, silver-haird, bespectacled and always impeccably dressed, had a formidable reputation for hard work. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was conceived and born at no cost to her parents under <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s state-funded <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But after an argument with the government <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about the high cost of his work, <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> quit the service in 1978. He and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> set up their clinic at Bourn Hall, an 11th century castle near <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, in 1980. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Sheena </PERSON>, whom he married in 1943, and a son and daughter.

<TEXT>
 Astronomers say a vague prediction by the 16th-century astrologer <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> has caused unfounded fear that an alignment of planets will trigger an earthquake that will destroy <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in May. `` There is no alignment of planets in May, and even if there were, it would n't have anything to do with earthquakes,'' <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. But rumors of an impending earthquake, spurred by writings of the French astrologer and the movie `` The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' which is being sold on videocassette, prompted more than 100 fearful people to call the observatory in recent weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We an tell by the phone calls that many people are getting needlessly afraid of the possibility of an earthquake,'' he said, calling the quake predictions `` bunk.'' Astronomer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, the observatory's program supervisor, wrote recently: `` There are 11,000 earthquakes each year in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area strong enough to be recorded. There may be a significant earthquake in May 1988, here or elsewhere ... but if there is, it will have nothing to do with the planets' positions.'' <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> said followers of Nostradamus, who lived from 1503 to 1566, have claimed he predicted such events as the Russian Revolution, the assassinations of <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. But Nostradamus' predictions, written in rhyme, `` are exceptionally vague, and in general it is only after the fact that a link can be made between his rhymed prediction and an historical event,'' <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> said. He said `` The Man Who Saw Tomorrow'' claimed <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> wrote that an alignment of <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, Jupiter, Mercury, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> will cause a major earthquake in May in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The prophecy is quoted incorrectly in the movie,'' <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> said. `` Nostradamus predicts a severe hailstorm, not an earthquake. ... There is no clue that tells us where this hailstorm will occur.'' <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> said: `` The last time the planets were supposed to align and trigger mass destruction in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was in 1982, the year of the ` Jupiter Effect,''' a book that claims the planets' tidal influence causes quakes. `` Untold millions did not die in 1982 and there's no reason to think that anything will happen in 1988,'' he said. Even if the planets were aligned, `` their gravitational effect would be completely negligible ... and they would have no effect on our planet's weather, tides or earthquakes,'' <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> added.

 Strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> offered to resign before the May 1989 presidential election if opponents agree to talks with his regime, but the opposition and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected the offer. `` The general has to go immediately _ not eventually,'' said <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition umbrella group. `` There will be no dialogue with him.'' <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said the general strike, which shut down over 90 percent of this nation's commerce on Monday, would be even more complete today. Indeed, most stores in the downtown area remained shuttered today. `` I say this to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>: Phooey,'' said one downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> merchant guarding his closed dry goods shop. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also dismissed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation offer as `` little more than ... a ploy'' to keep <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s cronies in power and the general in control of the armed forces `` <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> should go, and the sooner the better for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration dried up the flow of money to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency, in an effort to force him out, and the economy is near collapse. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offer to resign, announced Monday night in a national broadcast by civilian chief of state <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, was conditioned on a national dialogue with the opposition. But opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the proposed dialogue involved a hand-picked 33-member panel that would have 22 pro-Noriega members. `` This is not a dialogue,'' said <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>. `` It's just cynicism.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian government, left the presidential palace after <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s speech and hailed his proposal as a Panamanian solution, rather than one imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I have no reason to talk to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters. `` I talk to Panamanians.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had given his word `` as an officer and a gentleman'' to step down before elections scheduled for May 1989. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, elevated to chief of state when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, said he would accept the general's resignation only after the dialogue. Opposition leaders derided the proposal. `` He said, ` here I have a little piece of candy, and if you all behave, I'll give it to you, okay?,' said businessman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leignadier </PERSON>, a crusade member. <PERSON> Leignadier </PERSON> called the idea an insult to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. Crusade leaders said they expected even stronger support today for the general strike despite <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offer. On Monday, the strike almost totally shut down the capital of this nation of 2.5 million and, according to the crusade, outlying cities and towns as well. `` The paralyzation is total in industry, finance and commerce,'' said business leader <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>. About half of government employees _ who were warned they would be suspended if they went on strike _ failed to show up for work, he said. The strike was called after the government decreed a state of emergency last week allowing authorities to suspend constitutional rights. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said on Monday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` says they want a country without drug traffickers,'' but that continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> was the real motive behind the attack on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 25, after two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were handed up in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster on Feb. 26, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s international bank accounts, leaving the government and many private businesses without cash to pay employees. Retirees were told Monday they will not be paid this week. The dockworkers union official, <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told union leaders in a meeting at the presidential palace Sunday the country had no more money. After the government was unable to give full paychecks to employees last week, several national police members tried and failed to stage a military coup, and thousands of anti-Noriega rioters took the streets. One man hit by an army shotgun blast during last week's violence died Monday of his wounds, becoming the first death in the latest wave of unrest. Also Monday, the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> announced a shakeup, kicking out 17 officers connected with the coup attempt and promoting 98 loyal officers.

 Wedding guests looked on in horror as a suspected getaway car being chased by police ran down a bridesmaid, dragged her across the street and smashed into the church where the wedding had just taken place. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, was helping to decorate the bride and bridgroom's car Monday when she was hit and killed, police said. She had been a bridesmaid in the wedding of 21-year-old <PERSON> Valarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON> and 20-year-old <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> minutes before at <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Police were chasing a sports car which had been reported stolen last week when the car was driven onto a parking lot and hit the parked car onto which the wedding party had painted the words `` Just Married.'' The speeding car then ran over Ms. <PERSON> York </PERSON>, crossed the street and hit a corner of the church. The driver of the car ran a short distance and was caught and arrested. `` We were decorating the car and spraying it when we heard a loud noise,'' said <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>, the bride's mother. `` We had our backs turned and when we looked around, we saw him coming at us real fast.'' The bride's mother said she started pushing people out of the way and managed to get out of the path of the car herself. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, a friend of the bride, `` got caught between his car and my car and he drug her body across the street and slammed into the wall,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON> said. The police said the Firebird was reported to have been used as a getaway car in a shoplifting at a Little Rock store Sunday and was seen by a police officer less than a mile from the wedding scene Monday. The officer tried to stop the car but the driver sped away.

<HEAD>Chemical Company Recalls Gas Cylinders Nationwide In Wake of Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The company that distributed a cylinder of gas that exploded and killed three at a research laboratory here last week began recalling hundreds of similar cylinders nationwide, state officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based gas distributor, is recalling cylinders containing the gas silane following the blast at the <ORGANIZATION> Gollob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> here Thursday, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. A spokeswoman for the company in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said it was investigating the origin of the cylinder that exploded but declined to confirm the recall or comment further. The explosion was triggered by a silane cylinder that was contaminated with nitrous oxide, a highly unstable mixture, <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. The blast killed three people, seriously injured a Liquid Carbonics employee and forced the evacuation of 1,500 people living near the plant. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said Liquid Carbonics on Monday removed cylinders of silane from its <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> storage facility. Phone calls to <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonics </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> were unanswered. Elsewhere, about 1,000 workers were kept from their jobs Monday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after canisters containing potentially explosive chemicals were discovered at semiconductor facilities there. Chemical inspectors eventually concluded that four canisters at <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> in Mountain View were harmless, and work was scheduled to resume today. Another 150 cylinders stored at a Liquid Carbonics plant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> where they are manufactured were expected to be examined Tuesday, officials said. Company officials feared the canisters might have come from the same batch as the one that blew up. At a <ORGANIZATION> Gould </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> semiconductor plant in <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, another possibly contaminated silane cylinder bought from Liquid Carbonics was emptied Sunday after employees and residents of a nearby nursing home were evacuated, said a spokesman at <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> officials said Monday another potentially dangerous cylinder of silane that prompted officials to evacuate residents Friday night continued to burn at the Gollob plant. Two other potentially hazardous canisters at the site were removed Sunday. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said about 200 non-hazardous cylinders of gas remained at the site. State officials have not conducted an inventory of the gutted <PERSON> Gollob </PERSON> building and were trying to decide whether to let the flaming cylinder burn itself out, <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. Evacuees were allowed to return to their homes Sunday and businesses near the Gollob plant were allowed to reopen Monday.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can have `` great certainty'' that it will spot any Soviet attempts to cheat on the treaty eliminating medium-range atomic missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> unanimously concluded today. The testimony came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began working on the final details of the pact after two months of testimony on the treaty signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The Foreign Relations Committee is reviewing the pact. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders say they expect the treaty will be approved by the full chamber next month. Leaders of both parties have predicted the final tally will show 88 to 90 votes for the treaty, far more than the 67 needed for ratification. As part of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> review, the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> looked at <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ability to monitor Soviet compliance through a variety of means including on-site ground inspection and satellites. `` The intelligence community will be able to monitor the drawdown and elimination of declared Soviet missile launchers and associated equipment with great certainty,'' said the report, which was unanimously approved by the committee. But Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that more money needs to be spent to be sure of finding Soviet attempts to cheat on a separate treaty making deep cuts in long-range atomic weapons That prospective treaty is now being worked on by American and Soviet negotiators. `` The interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are served by effective, verifiable limitations on nuclear weapons,'' said <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>. `` Indeed, such limitations must continue to be pursued vigorously long after the issue of ratification of the -LRB- medium-range missile -RRB- treaty has been been resolved.'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, warned the foreign relations panel that `` no verification and monitoring regime can be absolutely perfect.'' Despite the expected outcome, the pact has come under fire from both Democrats and conservative Republicans. Democrats, led by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., are considering attaching a legal condition to the treaty which provides that the interpretation given by administration officials during treaty hearings is binding on future administrations Democratic officials were working late Monday to agree on some type of language, but no final proposal had been approved, according to congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity. The proposal arises from the ongoing dispute between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and congressional Democrats over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assertion that he has the legal right unilaterally to change the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. That change would allow some tests of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile defense system, but congressional Democrats have argued that any alteration in how a treaty is interpreted should first be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The White House told congressional Democrats last week it opposed the Democratic-backed effort to attach a condition to the treaty because the condition would require the executive branch to adhere to every statement made by administration officials during the hearings, `` no matter how trivial.'' The conservative opposition is led by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> has claimed that the administration made `` misrepresentations'' about the effect of the treaty, a charge that was flatly denied by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who was both the first and last administration witness to testify to the Foreign Relations panel, said the treaty `` stands on its merits'' and `` should not be made a vehicle for statements on other issues.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other administration officials have consistently urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to avoid so-called `` killer amendments'' that could force a reopening of negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Administration officials have also argued that rejection of the treaty would be a deep blow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prestige and power in the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. One condition which will be opposed is being offered by Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. The amendment will require <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` reaffirm to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> the importance Americans place on human rights and fundamental freedoms in the achievement of lasting peace among nations.''

 A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem cleric called today for extremists to kidnap more Americans because, he claimed, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was responsible for the problems in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` America is the cause of all our calamities,'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Subhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a published interview. `` The Moslems should chase <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s symbols everywhere.'' <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON>, a senior leader of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, was quoted as urging his followers to `` hold -LRB- hostage -RRB- all the American regime.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s highest ranking Shiite cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>, said he believed that the kidnapping of foreigners for political motives `` has reached its end.'' `` We are inclined to believe that this course of political action has reached an end,'' <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, an Arabic-language newsletter. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON> said he has never approved of kidnappings. His remark reflects differences within <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiite community over the abduction of foreigners. <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON> made his remarks in an interview published by the Hezbollah-financed weekly magazine <PERSON> Al-Wihda </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Islamiah </PERSON>, or Islamic Unity. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, made up of Shiites loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is believed to be an umbrella organization for underground groups holding most of the nine Americans missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON> also charged that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was an `` umbrella for many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s and the West's spies. The nine-nation 5,800-strong <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> has been deployed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 19, 1978. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt.

The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, believed to be a Hezbollah-affiliated group, claimed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction and claimed he was a spy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the charge. In addition to the nine Americans, 13 foreigners are missing after being kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are four Frenchmen, three Britons, one West German, one Italian, one Irishman, one Indian and two unidentified foreign men. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held foreign hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 A Protestant who allegedly killed three Roman Catholics in a gun and grenade attack at an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> funeral last week will be charged with six counts of murder, police said today. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, 33, has been in custody since last Wednesday when mourners grabbed and beat him as he fled the funeral in <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION>, firing and hurling grenades. Police gave no immediate details of the three other murder charges against Stone. But police sources have said <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> was also suspected of being connected with other killings of Catholics in recent years. Meanwhile, the Catholic ghettos of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> braced for a wave of arrests in the hunt for the killers of two British soldiers at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral Saturday. A crowd, some of whom apparently feared another <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> attack, beat and stripped the soldiers who were then shot dead by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. Police sources said up to 30 people may be arrested. Earlier today, British troops discoverd and detonated a homemade bomb outside an apartment building on the outskirts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. And police reported finding two rifles, grenades and a pistol in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Shantallow </LOCATION> district, the fourth cache found in the city this week. In <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, police sought the men who killed policeman <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> police checkpoint Monday. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was the 12th victim in two weeks of tension and sectarian violence in <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Police Chief Supt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkington </PERSON> said `` someone must have seen'' the gunmen who held a family hostage, fired on <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> from a row house and escaped in a hijacked car. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two TV networks, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday they have refused police demands to hand over untransmitted film of last Wednesday's funeral rampage on grounds this would endanger their crews in the future. `` This policy is to protect our film crews, to protect the lives of our staff,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who declined to be identified. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, `` A massive murder investigation is under way in which all possible resources are involved to identify all those responsible.'' He also announced an immediate review of a policy of not policing <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funerals. Police introduced the no-policing policy at last Wednesday's funeral for the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders who feared clashes between police and mourners The latest wave of tension and violence began March 6, when British commandos shot and killed three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> while they were allegedly planning a bombing attack in the British colony. Stone allegedly killed three people and injured 68 in Wednesday's funeral in <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> for the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members. At Saturday's funeral for an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> man killed in the <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> attack, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen killed two British soldiers, who were in civilian clothes at the time. Asked why police did not immediately order in heavily armed units on standby nearby, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said it was not clear at first to police commanders watching the army video that soldiers were being attacked. He said the authorities believed no security force personnel were in the area. `` The truth is that there will be new depths -LRB- of horror -RRB- again as long as this awful and evil campaign of terrorism and revenge continues,'' King told the Commons on Monday. `` It has got to stop.'' There were new calls for another attempt to find agreement between the province's mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> political parties to stop guerrilla groups. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, deputy leader of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must decide `` whether the priority is to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, or to find a political solution.'' At least 2,638 people have died in sectarian violence in <LOCATION> Norther </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since 1969. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under a leftist administration.

 Residents of the Northeast dug out winter overcoats and ski jackets as unseasonable cold gripped the region today, three days into spring. Temperatures were generally below freezing, with readings in the teens and single digits over much of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region and northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Subzero readings were reported at a few locations in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` Somebody left the door open on the north side of the house,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a forecaster for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We're getting a strong cold wind right out of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s Bay.'' Spring has been in disguise since it began Sunday; the 21-degree high in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on Monday was about 20 degrees below normal. `` Some of the early blooming flowers may be negatively affected. Some of the crocuses may not fare too well,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>, a horticulturalist in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, N.Y. However, many flowers may not have poked their shoots out of the ground yet, <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said. `` For the most part there has n't been enough warm weather yet to really get things started.'' Ten Northeastern cities reported records this morning, including <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where the 15 degree low tied the record set in 1965; <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where the 14-degree mark shaved a degree off the 1965 record; and <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where the 5 degrees cut three degrees off a record set in 1959. A reading of 7 degrees shortly after midnight set a record in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, N.Y. The old record low for the date was 8 degrees in 1965. <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was the coldest place in the nation at 2 a.m. EST, at zero degrees, and it was 18 degrees at 5:30 a.m. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> residents looked out on a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> that was still mostly ice-covered. However, a warming trend was expected to put winter to flight this afternoon and Wednesday, with temperatures rising into the 40s and 50s in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a weather specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>, on the shores of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, disavowed responsibility for the cold. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said a high-pressure system was driving the cold air from the north. `` That's why you're getting our weather. So you really ca n't blame us,'' he said. `` They call us the polar bear capital of the world. While you're getting our weather, we've got a south wind that's pushing our temperatures above normal,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said In <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION>, the high Monday was 10 degrees, seven degrees above normal.

 An Iranian gunboat and helicopter attacked a Norwegian-operated tanker carrying volatile chemicals through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at dawn today. A Greek supertanker later was reported set ablaze in another Iranian raid. Two crewmen were killed and four wounded in the first attack, on the 38,534-ton Havglimt, flying the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> flag, shipping executives reported. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired a missile at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today and mounted air raids on seven other cities, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The missile was the 45th aimed at the Iranian capital since the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> `` war of cities'' resumed March 13. Shipping executives said an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship patrolling the gulf picked up 10 seamen, who were floating in a raft after abandoning the Greek supertanker, the 357,130-ton <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> G.L </PERSON>. The executives said the other 19 Greek crewmen stayed on board to fight the flames. A salvage tugboat soon joined the effort. There were no casualties aboard the Greek vessel, which was attacked about 1 p.m. only a few miles south of where the Havglimt was hit in a dawn attack. The attacks were the seventh and eighth by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on neutral shipping since Friday. They came as 51 crewmen remained missing and were presumed dead after an Iraqi raid on two tankers near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> island oil terminal Earlier reports had said 54 crewmen were missing. The escalation of the `` tanker war'' came as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were locked in a series of missile duels and air raids on each other's major cities The two nations have been at war for 7 -LCB- years. Today's missile attack on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was the 106th such attack since Feb. 29. About 65 Iranian missiles have slammed into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in that time. Also Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> launched an artillery and rocket attack on <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, inflicting heavy casualties, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said. The Havglimt tanker, carrying ammonia and operated by the Oslo-based <ORGANIZATION> Havtor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was hit at dawn about 12 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, said the gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The dead crewmen were identified as <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> nationals, and the ship's Norwegian captain was among the wounded. Other members of the 26-man, multinational crew were mainly treated for inhalation of ammonia vapors, according to the executives. Four needed hospitalization. The fire in the engine room of the stricken tanker was brought under control by salvage tugboats, but the flames later reignited in the crew's quarters, the executives said. The British destroyer HMS Exeter, on patrol in the area, dispatched a helicopter to help rescue the crew, many of whom had fainted from fumes leaking from blasted cargo holds, the shipping sources said. A navy medical team wore gas masks as they were lowered from the helicopter onto the tanker to help airlift the seamen. The bodies of the dead and the injured crew members were lowered onto a salvage tugboat, which took them to a hospital at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, the sources said. The shipping executive said at least one gunboat raided the vessel with machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades. Forty minutes later, a helicopter fired rockets at the tanker. `` They went for the accommodation quarters. There were plenty, plenty of hits all over,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, who flew over the stricken tanker in a helicopter. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> resumed attacks on Iranian oil shipping lanes on March 8, after a lull in attacks in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for about a month. On Monday, Iranian gunboats attacked and set ablaze the 10,168-ton Spanish refrigerator ship Iberian Reefer and the 61,762-ton Liberian-registered Fumi with rocket grenades. No casualties were reported on board either ship. At least 51 crewmen remained missing from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Saturday attack near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal. The attack destroyed two Iranian-owned ships, the 253,837-ton <LOCATION> Sanandaj </LOCATION> and the 316,379-ton Avaj. The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the number of missing was `` imprecise,'' but the latest figure was 51. Earlier, Norwegian officials had said 54 crewmen, mostly Iranians and Asians, were presumed dead. A Swedish engineer also was among the missing. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it had no independent confirmation of the deaths and was working on the basis of gulf sources. Both ships were owned by the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but the <LOCATION> Sanandaj </LOCATION> crew was hired by a Norwegian firm, <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, and another <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> company, Scanact, had part interest in the Avaj. The maritime insurance firm, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, said 37 ships had been damaged in attacks by both <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this year.

<HEAD>Resolution On Religion And Politics Tabled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Delegates to the American Jewish Congress convention voiced concern today about the role of religious groups in politics but tabled a resolution urging churches and synagogues to refrain from active roles in political campaigns. The proposed resolution, which will be redrafted, had suggested it was `` inherently dangerous'' for religious groups to identify with one candidate or one political party. It reaffirmed the right of all people, including clergy, to seek political office. The resolution is expected to be taken up at a later national meeting of the group, but leaders did not indicate whether it would be during the 1988 presidential campaign. Discussion centered on whether delegates should take a strong stand against practices by two religious leaders now running for president, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The tabled resolution said `` certain recent practices of both these candidates are troubling issues,'' citing <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s use of church-owned buses to bring supporters to caucuses and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s effort during the Super Tuesday primaries to collect contributions in churches In their nearly unanimous decision to redraft the resolution, delegates said it could be counterproductive and also should not refer to any individual. On Monday night, an <ORGANIZATION> AJC </ORGANIZATION> leader urged that a new world Zionist meeting be convened in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the 1990s to unify Jews everywhere with Israelis and to heal the division over how to achieve peace with the Arabs. `` We are indeed one people, sharing one destiny, no matter where we live,'' executive director <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON> told delegates at the 70th anniversary convention. <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON> reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> AJC </ORGANIZATION>'s support for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan calling for talks on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, followed by an international peace conference including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors. He also spoke out against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s condemnation of Jews who object to his opposition to the plan. `` The Jewish people everywhere, and not only those who vote in support of a particular <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> party, have a right to speak up when they believe certain policies profoundly violate a legacy that belongs to the Jewish people collectively, even if finally only the citizens of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will vote and make those decisions on which their security depends,'' <PERSON> Siegman </PERSON> said.

 One moment, <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON> <PERSON> Anrig </PERSON> was peacefully flying her kite. The next, she too was soaring through the air, courtesy of a passing plane which snagged the kite string. `` I'm very sore _ and I was very scared,'' said the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, youngster after spending Monday at home on an air mattress, surrounded by ice packs. `` I want to go kite flying again, but where there are no airplanes.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON> and her father, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON>, were flying the kite at Shoreline Park, using strong 200-pound test line. Suddenly, a plane taking a patient to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> snagged the kite and jerked her off the ground. She flew about 200 feet, about 10 feet off the ground, until she let go to avoid hitting a tree. She was bumped and bruised, but otherwise uninjured. Pilot <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Uranga </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and his passenger also were uninjured and the plane landed safely at <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> airport nearby.

All he saw was a shadow going over his head. `` I'm just thankful she let go.''

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today he is pleased with new guidelines prohibiting discrimination against federal employees with the AIDS virus. `` We worked very closely with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managment </ORGANIZATION> in developing them,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, the No. 2 official of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and head of the health service. `` The regulations are reasonable and reflect PHS concerns,'' <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said. He and other health service officials will brief personnel officers from about 30 federal agencies on the guidelines on Thursday. The rules, which will allow federal supervisors to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse to work with colleagues carrying the virus, were distributed to federal agencies this week. `` The federal government, as an enlightened and compassionate employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees, has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of the AIDS epidemic,'' <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said in a memo accompanying the guidelines. The guidelines instruct federal agencies to treat AIDS-infected employees `` in the same manner as employees who suffer from other serious illnesses.'' They also say there is `` no medical basis for employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency clients.' If an employee's threat or refusal to work with an AIDS-infected co-worker disrupts office functions, managers are told to `` consider appropriate corrective or disciplinary action against the threatening or disruptive employees.'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said agencies should grant leave to AIDS-infected employees `` in the same manner as they would for other emloyees with medical conditions.'' AIDS-infected employees may continue their life insurance, but can not increase their coverage after they become seriously ill, the guidelines state. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge ruled today that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney can formally protest the legality of racketeering and drug trafficking charges, even though the Panmanian strongman has not appeared in court to answer the indictment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> granted permission for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, to file a `` limited appearance'' on behalf of the embattled strongman. `` This limited appearance would be solely for the purpose of attacking the legality and sufficiency of the indictment,'' said <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, among a battery of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorneys retained by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The decision came over vehement objections from Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, who said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney could not make any arguments until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> responds legally to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment by making an appearance. <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had not surrendered nor made any court appearance to answer charges in the sealed indictment returned by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Feb. 4, which named <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and 15 other people. <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> were involved in a heated exchange during the hearing in <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>'s courtroom. `` I represent General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> told the judge. `` The government objects. He has no client to represent!'' responded <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>. `` I have a client and Mr. <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> knows that I have a client,'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> shot back, to which <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> responded, `` Then bring him here!'' <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> agreed to let <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> file by Friday a memorandum of law setting forth his position. He gave <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> until the following Friday to respond. `` You may file your motion; then we'll decide whether you can argue it,'' <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>. Only one of the 16 defendants named in the indictment, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidow </PERSON>, was at today's hearing. <PERSON> Davidow </PERSON>, 26, the only person to surrender in the case thus far and be arraigned, has pleaded innocent to the racketeering conspiracy count and other charges in the indictment. He is free on $ 500,000 bond after his family posted 10 percent of that amount with the court. <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> delayed setting a trial date after <PERSON> Davidow </PERSON> made a formal waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Most of the other defendants named in the indictment were in either <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Anglican bishops, including an envoy sent by the <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, today pledged support for Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in his confrontation with the government. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, has angered President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> by declaring that he and other church leaders will carry on the work of anti-apartheid groups which last month were banned from operating. Nineteen bishops, after an emergency meeting with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, issued a statement warning that the government `` is driving this beloved country closer to civil war.'' `` We offer Archbishop <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> our loyalty and support,'' the bishops said. `` We shall not allow the government to isolate him.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who declared that the government would `` bite the dust,'' said it was important that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and other white South Africans `` know that I am not just spouting forth things that come into my head.'' `` These are responsible people,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, gesturing to the bishops. `` They would have knocked me down if they believed that what I am saying is inconsistent with the gospel.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, last week and suggested that the archbishop had aligned himself with the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Referring to this, the bishops said they `` take grave offense at the cavalier way'' in which <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> treated <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. Among those attending today's meeting was Bishop <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lichfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who was sent as representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is spiritual leader of the 70-million-member worldwide Anglican communion. `` He is a Christian leader,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` His objections to apartheid grow directly out of his pastoral work.'' At a news conference Monday, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> dared <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to take action against him. `` If they try to restrict me or ban me, they are just wasting their time, because I will not obey their orders,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. `` They will have to put me in jail.'' `` I ca n't keep looking over my shoulder to see if God has got the approval or disapproval of the government,'' he added. Three weeks ago, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and 24 other church leaders were arrested and briefly detained after they tried to march to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> with a petition protesting the latest crackdown on opposition. Last month, the government banned 17 other organizations from participating in any activity not approved by the government. Since then <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other church representatives have taken up the struggle against apartheid, which by law and custom establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not say whether he expects <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to do that. Asked by reporters if he would be satisfied should <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down but not leave his Central American country, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We feel <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, questioned as he arrived at the Capitol for talks on the possibility of resuming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, was asked if he expected <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to agree to leave his nation. `` I'm not making any predictions,'' the president replied. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that the Panamanian people clearly have not been deceived by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s conditional offer to step down by May 1989 <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Panamanians regard the offer as a `` ploy to buy time,'' a view shared by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The message from Panamanians is clear. For the good of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should leave,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` His presence is the root cause of continued political and economic instability,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added. `` The ongoing general strike is only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelming opposition from all segments of Panamanian society to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s continued rule. On Monday, shortly after <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s chief of state, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, told Panamanians of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offer, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> press officer <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said, `` We stand by our previous view that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go, and the sooner the better for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had given his word `` as an officer and a gentleman'' to step down before Panamanian elections scheduled for May 1989 if his conditions _ which include talks with opposition leaders _ are met. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offer `` totally ignores the reality of the situation.'' `` Almost everyone in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> wants him out tomorrow and wants him out of the country,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week to discusss terms under which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might step down. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement released by <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said: `` We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy to attempt to legitimize the illegal <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> regime by calling for negotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort on the part of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to maintain direct or indirect control of the Panamanian Defense Forces.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment on federal drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has dried up the flow of money to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency, in the effort to force him out, and the economy is near collapse. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the problem, and his preoccupation with remaining on the scene despite overwhelming domestic opposition will only insure continued economic and political instability there,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last week and rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for him to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and live in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was dismissed by the legislature after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is still recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president.

<TEXT>
 Parliament on Tuesday approved a government plan to raise the speed limit on the nation's highways from 62 mph to 74 mph. The vote ended several years of debate by environmentalists, pro-auto lobbying groups and the government, which conceded the old speed limit was widely ignored. The decision, scheduled to go into effect May 1, marked the demise of a measure that followed the 1973 Arab oil embargo against the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The new speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour had been vigorously opposed by vocal environmentalist groups, which said it would further damage the fragile environment in this crowded nation of 14.6 million people. The groups, backed by left-wing political parties, faced a powerful lobby of road builders, garage owners and other car-related interests. The old speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour remains in force along the highway in the densely populated urban crescent stretching from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> via The Hague and <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Utrecht </LOCATION> in the central <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The last two years have been the warmest in this country in more than three decades, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Both 1986 and 1987 recorded average temperatures for the year of 54.0 degres Fahrenheit over the 48 contiguous states, the agency said. These were the warmest years since 1953, which averaged 54.7 to tie with 1934 for the warmest year in this century. By contrast, records going back to 1895 show the normal annual average temperature for the 48 states is 52.5 degrees. The coldest year was 1917, which averaged 50.7. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said the combination of the position of the jet stream upper air currents and the high pressure center located over <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> were contributing factors in the recent warm years. `` The more basic thing is why they were in those positions, and that's more difficult to answer,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> said. `` The concern everyone has in the back of their mind is if it's part of the greenhouse gas effect'' that has been reported on, he said The greenhouse effect is a prediction of computer models, which say increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere could act much like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping heat and raising the temperature of the Earth. `` It's not clear yet,'' if that is a factor in the warmth of 1986 and 1987, `` but it bears watching,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> said. Until 1986 the average temperature of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been running at or slightly below normal in the 1980s, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> said, even though worldwide temperatures seemed to be on the increase. In 1986, he said, the spring was particularly warm across the country. The winter of 1986-87 and the spring of 1987 also were unusually warm, particularly in the north-central region.

 The offer of asylum to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> maintains a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> tradition of opening its doors to Latin Americans seeking a place of exile. The hospitality stems from historic and cultural ties with <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that transcend <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> party politics. But the <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that is prepared to offer asylum to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is far different from the country that took in ousted <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> in 1959. During the 36-year rule of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> became a haven for <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>, Colombian ruler <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON>, ousted Argentine leader <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, toppled Dominican President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> and Venezuelan strongman <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> arrived in 1957 after a stopover in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> spent time in <LOCATION> Madeira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> before settling in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> wandered from <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> after his 1955 ouster before arriving in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> in 1960. Both <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, ousted in 1958, and <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, a democratically elected president toppled in 1963, lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before coming to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s conditions for receiving all were simple: maintain a low profile and do n't meddle in Spanish or foreign politics. In the case of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> says Spanish policy is to accept requests when asylum could help maintain or restore democracy in a specific country. As conditions for accepting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> requires that he himself ask for asylum, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agree not to seek his extradition on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges filed against him in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal courts, and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> honor the 1977 treaty under which control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> will revert to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 2000. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has refused to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But he has said he is willing to step down as military leader prior to the 1989 presidential elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> spokesman, said since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s transition to democratic government in 1977, the type of political exile in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has changed considerably `` Since then, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has taken in many Chileans, Argentines and Uruguayans fleeing from military dictatorships,'' he said. `` The case of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is separate, but it is a concrete example of our willingness to serve as a support for a democratic solution to a problem.'' During the waning years of the Franco regime in the early 1970s, not all the Latin American exiles in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> were rightist dictators. Former Economics Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulloa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> came to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> after the army ousted President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> in 1968. <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> moved to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> after Gen. <PERSON> Agusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> overthrew President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in 1973. Most of the Latin American leaders exiled in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> have lived in the opulent suburbs north of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> of a heart attack in 1973. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, 74, still lives in a palatial residence in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moraleja </LOCATION>. Until his return to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> after an 18-year exile, <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> held court at his 17th of October estate in <LOCATION> Puerta </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Hierro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> laid down the law to <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> four years after his arrival when the Argentine general tried an unsuccessful return to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> in 1964 and threatened him with explusion if he kept up his politicking. But by 1970 <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was again receiving a steady stream of visitors and plotting his return to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> where he was elected president in 1973. He died a year later. His widow, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estela </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, who succeeded her husband as the first woman head of state in the Western hemisphere, lives in quiet exile in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> after her overthrow by the military in 1976 and five years of house arrest in southern <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Parole Examiners Recommend Bosch Release In May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two federal parole examiners recommended today that anti-Castro militant <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> be released from prison May 16 after completing a three-month sentence for violating his parole. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of conspiring to bomb foreign freighters and firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a Polish freighter docked in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, served four years of his 10-year federal prison sentence. He has acknowledged violating parole when he fled to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1974. He served 11 years in Venezuelan jails until his final acquittal on charges of bombing a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jetliner in which 73 died in 1976. The recommended sentence, which includes time <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> has spent in jail since returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The panel is expected to decide within three weeks. But after serving his three-month sentence, the 61-year-old <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> will likely be taken into custody by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoss </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has targeted <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> for exclusion hearings and possible deportation. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally last month after his release from a Venezuelan prison. Since mid-February, he has been detained at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> hugged his family after learning the examiners' recommendation, said his daughter, <PERSON> Myriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> `` We're very satisfied with the recommendation,'' she said. `` We think it's very fair.'' <PERSON> Yoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> probably would not appeal the recommended sentence for his 1974 parole violation. `` It's something Dr. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, the family and we can all live with,'' <PERSON> Yoss </PERSON> said. Several prominent Cuban-Americans, including <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON>, head of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, testified today before the parole examiners in a hearing closed to the public because it is an administrative procedure, federal officials said. <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> should be released because he has learned his lesson and would now work peacefully for the overthrow of Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> is recalling about 45,000 GE and RCA brand electric surge suppressors which could present a shock hazard, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Known as <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> surge suppressors, the units were sold nationally between October 1986 and December 1987, officials said. No injuries have been reported, but officials said a defect in some of the units could allow their metal housings and the metal housings of any connected appliances to become electrified, creating the potential for a shock. Involved are GE surge suppressor models EPC-6S, EPC-6MS, EPC-4NS and EPC-CPU as well as RCA models SK416 and SKF416. The items sold for $ 40 to $ 60. They resemble a gray power strip with four or six electrical outlets. Each has an on-off switch, a power indicator light, resettable circuit breaker and 6-foot cord. The product was designed to prevent damage from sudden electrical power surges to such equipment as personal computers, stereos, televisions and other appliances. Owners of the units should disconnect them from the outlet, without touching the metal housing, and mail them to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Attn: <ORGANIZATION> EPC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recall </ORGANIZATION>, P.O. Box 8203, <LOCATION> Beaverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, 97076. The units will be replaced and postage costs reimbursed. Anyone needing more information may contact GE at 1-800-626-2000 or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Gore Talks Populism But His Eyes Light Up on Technical Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> stood in front of one of the most powerful computers ever built and for half an hour spoke with the kind of emotion not often seen in the 1988 presidential race. He complained of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` starvation of super-computing,'' and described his vision _ a nationwide fiber-optic network connecting such machines for research and business, a public works project as important as the building of interstate highways a generation ago. When he was done, a television reporter's first question made <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s face sag. What, the newsman wanted to know, did the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator think of the latest polls that showed him trailing in the presidential race. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> managed a chuckle and, after a pause, gave the answer he had repeated three times before in three other cities that day: Polls are sometimes wrong. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had come to the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, one day before <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' important Democratic presidential primary last week, to talk super-computers _ the kind that perform millions of calculations in an instant, and whose usefulness is more widely assumed than understood. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s performance, and the staging and timing of the event, illustrate the incongruity that sometimes surfaces as he takes his campaign to the North. He uses newly adopted slogans about `` working men and women,'' and of bringing the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` back to the grass roots'' _ populism that proved successful in the South. Yet <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> often seems more inspired when the discussion turns to deeply technical issues of the sort that may not evoke much response from those working men and women he seeks. `` Super-computing will be the engine of the information age,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. He and his audience were crowded into an antiseptic, white-floored and glass-walled room with a Cray super-computer the size of two or three Coca-Cola machines and about as red. With him were his wife and his father. `` What we have seen in the last several years is the emergence of an entirely new field of scientific inquiry _ computational science,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` It's time we move forward to create a national infrastructure that enables us to take advantage of that computational science.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 39, was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, showing an intellectual curiosity that led him to enroll in both the divinity and law schools, finishing neither. In 12 years as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he immersed himself in issues such as medical technology, organ transplants and arms control. He gained the reputation of an arms-control specialist who enjoys detail. On his campaign plane he talks with excitement of `` unmistakeable signs,'' in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troop placements of recent weeks, that the Soviets' `` basic posture is undergoing re-evaluation.'' But his claimed expertise can be a two-edged sword. Rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> `` got taken to the cleaners'' when he led Democratic negotiations with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over arms control and Star Wars. There's also the possible problem of bogging down his audience _ in what is, after all, a political battle _ with detail on technical subjects. For example, there was his campaign statement last week reacting to reports that ozone _ a protective layer of atmosphere shielding out harmful rays _ was disappearing faster than thought. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> called for an immediate ban on `` non-essential uses of chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB-'' as propellants in aerosol sprays. Beyond that, he outlined five other steps, including `` an immediate $ 1 per pound assessment of the most harmful CFCs, rising to $ 5,'' and having the president `` personally call on the leaders of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to ratify the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> protocol, and to put the issue on the June summit.'' No explanation of that protocol, or much else, was given. Still, in person and in the campaign statement, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did take care to make broader points. The computers are keys to increased competitiveness, he said. And ozone depletion raises the threat of skin cancer. The candidate who loves to talk technical detail became, in the campaign press release, `` an environmental <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today issued a plea to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans to help him revive his stalled policy of aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, but said Democrats will be to blame if the rebels go out of existence. The president, in a one-hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and later with a group of state and county <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials, called on <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members to unite behind a new effort to push some kind of help for the rebels through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29. `` We are determined to get continued assistance to the resistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,'' the president told the closed meeting of lawmakers on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, according to a text of his remarks provided by the White House. Alluding, however, to Democratic efforts to thwart any military aid for the rebels, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added, `` Those who led the fight against our package of assistance to the democratic resistance can not escape responsibility'' if the rebel forces wither. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in response to a reporter's question, declined to say precisely what kind of aid package he was supporting. In a separate session with the local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> again pointed the finger of blame at <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, who played hardball to win the vote to cut off aid, now says it wo n't accept responsibility for the destruction of the freedom fighters. But if the freedom fighters are extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be the ones to decide who is responsible,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The White House has encouraged a bipartisan group of Contra supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> who are proposing a one-year, $ 48 million `` humanitarian'' aid package that also would give the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> the right to deliver previously stockpiled weapons, and the president the right to get a quick vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on sending new military aid under certain conditions. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> visit that the administration has not yet aligned itself with any specific bill, but would like to have a package introduced soon and a vote prior to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' departure next week for an Easter recess. `` We'd like to have a vote before then,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said the administration `` will surely be supporting, or at least encouraging, the kind of movement we are seeing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, R-Ill., said last week's incursion across the Honduran border by Sandinista troops was creating political pressure on some of the moderate Democrats whose votes have been crucial to the outcome of the closely divided issue in the past `` That does n't do anything but help our side,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. Adding to that pressure, said Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Miss </LOCATION>., is the instability in other areas of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> `` The whole region is still in an unstable condition,'' he said. Some moderate Democrats last week `` were quite pale in their appearance when they realized there was this incursion'' into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We think there is some potential there to get a few more votes than we have had in the past,'' said <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vote counter. Before the meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters he hopes the cease-fire talks between the Sandinista government and the rebels will be successful, but said he would not withhold pressure for new Contra aid to await the outcome of the talks. `` I hope they can achieve something there'' in the talks, he said. Asked if he would hold up a new request for rebel aid while the talks are in progress, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` We have n't given that any consideration.'' Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said an aid package should be developed during the cease-fire talks. `` We want to be prepared in the event negotiations break down, so there's always a fallback position,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` We ought to be very wary ... take a more worst-case scenario.'' House Democrats said any action on further aid should await the outcome of those negotiations. `` What we need to watch very carefully is the peace talks,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said on Monday. `` I hope both sides will be very forthcoming.'' The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels on Monday opened three days of talks at the border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> by exchanging cease-fire proposals and agreeing to a truce during the negotiations. Asked about prospects for a $ 48 million Contra aid proposal being drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> backers of the rebels, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> objected to provisions that allow the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to continue delivering previously stockpiled weapons and that would guarantee a future vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on new military aid. `` If they would agree to humanitarian aid without military aid, that could be done very swiftly,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` We would be ready to meet -LRB- with Republicans -RRB- at any time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in a toughly worded <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor speech, said the administration's policies have produced few positive `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, after all of this _ not to mention several hundred million dollars _ has achieved virtually nothing positive in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We have no right to ask Americans to risk their sons and daughters when there are other solutions we have not even tried.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has invited a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation to help celebrate the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in the region, but Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> wo n't be a member of it, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said Tuesday Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> made the disclosure at a news conference at which he presented the pope's letter on the millennium of Christianity in Kievan Rus', the ancient name of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The celebrations are scheduled for June. The letter stressed <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> roots and said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> unity is essential to peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the world. Willebrands, president of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Secretariat for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, said a representative of the Russian Orthodox church patriarch made the invitation orally to two officials of his agency March 18 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, as head of the Roman Catholic church, was invited to send a delegation to celebrations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> being organized by the Russian Orthodox church. When an official written invitation is received, the pontiff will name the delegation for the trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which is expected to last about 10 days, the Dutch-born cardinal said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> often has expressed interest in visiting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> said the pope had not received a personal invitation to the celebration and had no plans to attend, but that does not rule out a posssible future visit. He said it would not be `` opportune'' for the pope to attend the observance because `` he can not make his pastoral visit, which is destined primarily for Catholics, during celebrations organized by another church.'' The pope has said he would visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if he was allowed to visit Roman Catholics throughout the country, including the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Three years ago, he disclosed that Soviet authorities had refused permission for him to visit <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, a Catholic stronghold. In his 39-page letter to bishops around the world, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged the faithful to join in prayer to mark the baptism in 988 of Prince <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> on the banks of the Dnieper in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. `` The whole Catholic church turns its gaze to that event and shares spiritually in the joy of the heirs to that baptism,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> praised Christians in the region, who he said have sometimes experienced `` persecution and martyrdom'' in those 1,000 years. `` In particular, we join with all the heirs of this baptism, whatever their religious confession, nationality or dwelling place, with all our Orthodox and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> brothers and sisters,'' the letter said. `` In a special way, we join with all the beloved sons and daughters of the Russian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian nations. To those who live in their homeland, as also to those who dwell in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other parts of the world.'' The millennium is `` in a special way the feast'' of the Russian Orthodox church, which `` remains united to the Catholic church with very close links,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote. `` At this solemn moment in history the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community ... sends to her 1,000-year-old sister church, through the bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the kiss of peace as a manifestation of an ardent desire for that perfect communion.'' In a plea for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> unity, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> roots of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> present `` a particularly pressing challenge to the unity of Christians. ... The desire for unity and peace, the desire that barriers should be broken down and opposition removed... is becoming an impelling sign of our times. `` True peace can only exist on the basis of a process of unification in which each people is able to choose, in freedom and truth, the path of its own development.''

<HEAD>Hanford Nuclear Reservation Plant Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation plutonium processing plant was shut down and two technicians were suspended in the wake of an incident involving the improper transfer of chemicals, a <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. Operations at the Plutonium-Uranium Extraction Plant, or PUREX, were suspended over the weekend as a precautionary measure, said spokesman <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>. The temporary suspension resulted from an incident Friday in which a valve was left open and a batch of the wrong chemical solution was transferred to a tank, <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said. As a consequence, the certifications of two nuclear process operators were suspended for failing to follow operating procedures, he said. The event was declared to be an infraction of a `` criticality prevention specification.'' A `` criticality'' is an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction resulting in a rapid buildup of radiation and heat. It is caused by such factors as the amount, shape, density and enrichment of plutonium or uranium and the manner in which they are stored. There was no danger of a criticality incident and no danger of a radioactiuve release to the environment, <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said. It has not been determined how long operations will be suspended, he said. The PUREX plant was closed for a time in October 1986 because of safety concerns over plutonium handling and possible accidents. Westinghouse Hanford officials who took over operation of the plants in July 1987 promised to make safety a top priority. The chemical transfer incidents were the latest in a series of safety-related ones at the PUREX facility, which dissolves fuel rods to remove plutonium and uranium for reprocessing. The cause of contamination of two crane operators at the facility March 14 is still under investigation. Radioactive contamination was found in one crane operator's home and another contamination was found on another operator as he prepared to leave the plant. Both men were decontaminated and returned to work the next day.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Decline Again, But Economists Still
Optimistic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods fell 1.8 percent in February, but analysts said the second consecutive monthly decline had not shaken their belief that manufacturing will be a bright spot in the economy this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Tuesday said that orders for durable goods _ items expected to last three or more years _ totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 111.4 billion in February, following an identical 1.8 percent January decline. It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable goods orders have fallen for two consecutive months. The February decline surprised economists, but they maintained that manufacturing companies were still enjoying boom times because the weaker dollar has boosted export demand. `` The fundamentals continue to look positive for manufacturing,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` What we have is a two-month hesitation after some big increases.'' Manufacturing is expected to be a major source of strength this year as businesses step up production to meet rising export demand and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies increase orders for capital equipment to expand their production capabilities. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is forecasting that almost half of all economic growth in 1988 will come from rising export demand. Still, analysts said the back-to-back declines did show that businesses were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in an effort to get control of bulging inventories. Inventories swelled at the end of 1987 while consumer demand fell. Economists once had feared this combina4hn could be enough to topple the country into a recession. But brighter statistics this year, including continue declines in the unemployment rate in February, have eased those concerns. CynthIaXLatta, an economist with Data Resources Ik # -, noted that while new orders fell in February, the toas no immediate response from the rebels, who have been supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the start of their fight in late 1981. Negotiators for both sides were optimistic after the first day of cease-fire talks Monday, the first held since December. Also Monday, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> withdrew its soldiers from the Honduran border and declared an end to fighting with Contra rebels while the talks are held in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. The Honduran military reported Sandinista soldiers had retreated. `` The importance of today was that we listened for the first time at the highest level their -LRB- Contras' -RRB- proposal, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s defense minister, told journalists in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a negotiator for the U.S.-backed rebels, called the first round a `` step ahead'' and said they discussed a wide range of issues. `` Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. Monday's session was held under tight security at the customs post in this town beside the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, along the bank of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. At stake in the talks, scheduled to resume today, is an end to the bloodshed that has claimed an estimated 50,000 dead and wounded and shattered the country's economy. The Sandinista proposal to stop the fighting calls for an `` immediate and definitive cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He did not elaborate. The Contra plan calls for a 30-day truce, political amnesty, press freedom and continued talks to work out a lasting cease-fire, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Arana </PERSON>, a rebel spokesman, said the talks went beyond the bounds earlier established by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and included political issues and `` concepts of democracy.'' `` We spoke about everything,'' he said. The goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> is to work out a viable cease-fire in accordance with the regional peace plan signed last August by the presidents of the five Central American nations. They had said the talks would cover only the mechanics of how the Contras would lay down their arms. The rebels said the talks should include discussion of democratic reforms, also covered in the regional peace plan. `` We came here with an open agenda,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a Contra leader, told journalists at the border post. `` And that includes democratization including amnesty. We insisted on speaking about all the problems facing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Negotiations opened after <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were suspending military operations for the duration of the talks and called on the Contras to do the same. <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> told reporters the `` reciprocation of the Contras'' in agreeing to suspend hostilities and `` the fact that this meeting is taking place are the first positive steps'' toward a permanent cease-fire. President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday signed a document that dealt with a number of internal problems. The statement called on all political parties to refrain from violence, a position targeted at the government supporters who have attacked the opposition. It also calls for the media to respect the government, a reference to the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised to release more than a dozen recently jailed labor leaders and review cases of imprisoned opposition politiciaans. The Sandinistas' willingness to comply with the peace plan was cited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional members as a reason for rejecting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s calls for additional military and nonlethal aid to the rebels. The peace plan also calls for internal dialogue with the political opposition.

 <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is considering a tougher sexual harassment policy that could result in the demotion or firing of faculty members found to be romantically involved with students. Under the proposal, if a student files a complaint, the faculty member would appear before a committee, which would evaluate evidence and decide punishment. `` The faculty have been the prime movers for this policy,'' <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, vice president for legal affairs, said Monday. `` We're not trying to create a hostile environment, we're trying to prevent one.'' Civil libertarians say such a policy might infringe on a person's constitutional right of free association. Other critics question whether a university can, or should, regulate relationships between adults. <ORGANIZATION> SMU </ORGANIZATION>, like most universities, prohibits faculty and staff from making sexual advances and seeking sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> SMU </ORGANIZATION> say they have received 10 sexual harassment complaints in the last five years, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> SMU </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affirmative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, said. Although some professors have been reprimanded, none have been dismissed, demoted or taken to court. <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, director of the Human Resources Women's Center, said the harassment policy was proposed by the center and the universitiy's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Status of Women. The Faculty <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved it in the spring of 1987. She said the proposal is now with the administration, which is investigating what legal sanctions can be used. The faculty <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would then review the proposal. With its approval, it will go to the Trustees. Ms. <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> said she thinks the proposal will be university policy by the end of the semester.

 Six months after Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, Roman Catholic leaders in three of the nine cities where he stopped still have bills to pay. The Archdiocese of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> owes as much as $ 2 million, and the nearby Diocese of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> still has at least $ 1 million to repay, church officials say. In <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, the church has yet to pay nearly $ 165,000 for renting a stadium. Church officials say the debts are paid for the pope's stops in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` We knew we would have some deficit, but we did n't think it would be of this magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Egnew </PERSON>, director of finance for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said the church has raised $ 2 million since the visit, but still owes at least $ 1.5 million. The Rev. <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, chief publicist for the archdiocese, put the total at $ 2 million. The <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> has a debt of $ 1.1 million, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Elisee </PERSON>. To help retire the debt, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell pieces of the elaborate $ 500,000, six-tiered stage used for the Mass at Candlestick Park. There are also plans for collections in the churches, receptions and direct appeals to the community, said <PERSON> Egnew </PERSON>. `` It's always harder to raise money after the event,'' said <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` Not a little bit harder, a lot harder.'' On the plus side, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said last week, he had just received a letter from a man who had been inspired to return to the church after a 20-year absence. He enclosed a check for $ 500, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elisee </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Monterey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 2 million and still owed $ 1 million to $ 1.1 million. The diocese plans an appeal to its 45 parishes, which have 145,000 members, and the church has been selling memorial magazines at $ 5 each and videotapes for $ 25. In some cities, church officials dipped into reserve funds and other accounts to cover the difference between costs and fund-raising efforts.

 Three-year-old <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> never heard a sound until the beep of a computer intruded on her silence. She cried. `` I should n't be happy to see Ash's tears, but I am,'' said her mother, <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who cried some herself. `` That means it's working. The <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> girl is believed to be the youngest person to get a cochlear implant. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balkany </PERSON> implanted the $ 17,000 electronic hearing aid during an operation at Porter Memorial Hospital. The 22-channel device stimulates the hearing nerve. The implant, considered experimental in children, bypasses damaged inner-ear cells by stimulating a tiny portion of the nerve fibers in the cochlea. Doctors say <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> eventually will be able to hear her own voice. The device also will help her pick up intonation patterns of people she is talking to and should improve her lip-reading. `` Without this, she has no hope of talking properly,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. `` She wants to be in the hearing world with everyone else.'' An implant patient must wear a nickel-size microphone on his ear. The microphone is linked to a battery pack that modulates the microphone's electrical signal, which ultimately stimulates the hearing nerve. <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s audiologist, said the noise transmitted to the cochlea is nothing like sounds in the hearing world; it is a monotone, like a bee's buzzing. `` She's going to learn that sensation is sound,'' Dinner said. `` She does n't know that yet. She does n't have a label for it.'' The first time Dinner activated the electronic device by computer, the little girl shrugged a shoulder. The second time, she rolled her eyes. `` The first two times were more like a brushing sensation, a tickling in her inner ear,'' Dinner said. The third time, Dinner calibrated the electronic signal higher so it was loud and painful. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> cried.

 A man who allegedly sought romance rather than religion has been barred by a judge from attending a church. Judge <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dranginis </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order Monday prohibiting <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmann </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> from attending the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe his motives to worship are not consistent with promoting the worship of God, but for the purpose of forming relationships, particularly with women,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, pastor of the chruch.

 Moslem nations were united Tuesday behind the Palestinian rebellion in Israeli-occupied lands, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> traded insults and there was no Islamic accord on the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war Foreign ministers of the 46-member Organization of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement condemning `` oppressive and criminal measures by the -LRB- Israeli -RRB- authorities against our brothers.'' <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, claimed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was aiding the emigration of Iranian Jews to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, according to a text of his remarks. In the statement about the rebellion, which began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the ministers said: `` All Moslems in the world are proud of this uprising.'' That echoed a speech by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> at the opening of the conference Monday, in which he said the `` blood of martyrs'' was being shed in the territories. More than 100 Arabs have been killed since the violence began. The ministers declared: `` Members of the organization are concerned to support Palestinians financially, politically and morally and also to back their sole legitimate representative, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' No indication was given of what form aid would take, or whether there would be financial assistance, and the statement did not elaborate. <PERSON> Tajer </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, told reporters: `` We can only provide support in a political manner, to pressure the world's nations to get them to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and reveal the meaning of the uprising I do n't remember seeing any request for financial support.'' <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s equivalent of a foreign minister, said the statement was valuable to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and especially `` for the people inside the territories. About <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> under terms of an anti-terrorist law, <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> said: `` We will keep the office open until <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police come and seal it off. Then we will go to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- headquarters -RRB- and live there.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> foreign minister, said the alleged help given Iranian Jews to move to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was `` a violation of the rules'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` How come <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which claims to support the Palestinian issue and the uprising, is helping Jews to migrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>?'' There was no elaboration in a text of his prepared remarks made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He gave no figures on the number of alleged emigrants. The Iranian envoy, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Taskhiri </PERSON>, denied the claim and accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of being `` Zionist.'' The point is sensitive in the Arab and Moslem world because many nations do not recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and oppose the emigration of Jews to the country.

 Testimony ended today on the first of three impeachment charges against Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, but a move for a quick vote on whether to oust <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office was withdrawn in the face of vehement opposition. `` It would be our everlasting disgrace if we do not consider all of the evidence from both sides in such a historic and important case,'' said Republican Sen. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>. After testimony ended on the first impeachment count, a charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to thwart an investigation into a death threat, Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consider voting on that charge alone. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had earlier agreed to hear evidence on all three charges before voting on any one. Conviction on the first count alone would have ended the trial early with the first term Republican removed from office. `` I would think if Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is exonerated he would be extremely happy to know he has one less article to face,'' she said. `` And if he is convicted, we should not go on and spend untold dollars of taxpayers money.'' In a heated debate, the motion won support from Democrats but was opposed by Republicans, and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> finally withdrew it. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have been required to change the trial rules. The prosecution then said it was ready to begin presenting evidence on the second charge against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> _ alleged that he misused $ 80,000 from a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The last witness on the obstruction of justice count was <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, who this morning seized the opportunity to give a lengthy speech in praise of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s political philsophy He called <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> an `` uncommon politician'' who sought no personal aggrandizement and wanted only to improve the quality of life in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The speech brought an objection from prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> and Craft was instructed to stick to answering questions. Craft, in an abrupt role change, became a witness Monday and said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` did n't know that he was obstructing anything'' when he told the state's top lawman he would not cooperate with the attorney general's investigation of the alleged death threat. Craft was subpoenaed at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. Craft was a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> insider when the threat against a witness before a grand jury investigating <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was reported to the governor on Nov. 13. `` I never heard ` felony.' I never heard ` death threat' and I certainly never heard ` tampering with a grand jury witness,''' <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> said Monday. `` I never heard those words, which would have been an alarm to me.'' Later, in his cross-examination, <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> asked Craft whether he had ever advised the embattled governor to resign. `` We had these meetings and no one could see a political escape route for the governor,'' <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> said. `` No one was offering the governor any other political option than to go down with the ship.'' Thefirst charge alleged that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to thwart the investigation of the alleged death threat against former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> confidant <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. At the time, Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was about to testify before the state grand jury about <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s failure to report a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The next article charges <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> with misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The third impeachment article accuses him of concealing the $ 350,000 campaign loan. Craft and co-defense counsel <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said they opposed taking an early vote. `` We ought to hear all the evidence on all three articles and then let them vote,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. In his testimony, Craft echoed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in contending the governor was not fully informed that the situation involved a felony and the possible tampering of a grand jury witness. `` Nobody said the house is burning down, we've got a crisis,'' <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> said. `` I did n't know that a crime had been committed.'' However, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, a Republican, noted that then-chief of staff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> testified that he considered the matter to be serious and that he assumed the Department of Public Safety was investigating. `` What is mystifying is how two people can sit in the same meeting'' and come away with different impressions, <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said. A two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in six decades and the first ever in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of concealing the $ 350,000 campaign loan, and a May 17 recall election.

 The inimitable <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> has toned down his sexy, exaggerated look, but he had enough opulent fabrics in his Tuesday winter ready-to-wear show to please the fans of his show-off styles. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, by contrast, preferred the ultra simple lines, in short skirts and tailored pants. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> and some others, remains in the `` feminine-fancy'' school of designing, despite this season's trend to somewhat simpler, more practical styles In one variation on the tent dress, he puts bright flowered and flowing silk or light wool tunics over narrow skirts. But <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> also sneaked in a print chemise dress from the 1950s, knotted and draped baggily in back. Rose, salmon and dusky shades of blue and green or brighter tones all turned up in <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s vast color palette. Crazy over fabrics, he mixed them with somewhat less abandon this time around. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, brown or camel colored short coats were often paired with outfits that had lean knee-revealing skirts in polished leather: a flashy, fascinating new look here. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> still likes big bertha or flounced collars using them on lots of ensembles. He ca n't forget leg o'mutton sleeves, ruffles and bows, either. As usual, velvet was used richly in <ORGANIZATION> Ungaro </ORGANIZATION>'s suits _ as a single-lapelled collar, a wide jacket-hem border, or overall in dressy suits in shades of claret, deep purple or black. Another success in opulence was to pair a velvet-piped paisley long and fitted jacket with a teeny draped black jersey cashmere skirt. Even pants looked dressy, with their little velvet or irridescent taffeta vests and fitted jackets, plus flowered blouses. Bows on derrieres or the hips of draped pants gilded the lily a bit. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s body-hugging draped cocktail numbers were less risque than last season, nearly hitting the knee instead of grazing the upper thigh. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s less expensive line called `` Solo <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>,'' shown last week, had much of the same allure, but looked much more comfortable. His ribbed spencers with flowered sheaths or his checked skirts with windowpane plaid reefers could even be worn to the office without raising eyebrows. At <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, meanwhile, the trend to short skirts continued, but the collection looked more sane than sexy. Designed by <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douvier </PERSON>, the clothes had a certain played-down attraction. Soft wool coats were ample and short, with caped and huge squared-off collars. These were worn over tailored trouser suits and dresses in browns, tans or striking jewel colors. Bright belted tunics with dark skirts or straight tunics with elaborate wool embroidery in swirly ribbon patterns were also items for the safe dresser. The diagonal plaid belted suits in frank yellow, green or red make a peppy change. Late-day flocked velvet or cloque silk suits were easily fitted, and dance dresses with shirred tops and puffy taffeta skirts also came down the runway. The shocking pink or black flounced taffeta gowns, short in front, long in back, are no shockers, but are gala enough to wear without looking like a wallflower. <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION>, usually known for expensive hand-finished leather bags and scarves, is making a bigger effort to steer customers to the ready-to-wear racks. Designed by <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergere </PERSON>, the line remained firmly in the classic sportswear vein. As the redingote sweeps <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION> had the last word in its brown or red models topped with jumpers' netted bowler hats But fitted suits with oval skirts and plaid spencers or A-line jackets over slim gray flannel hats looked just as appealing for a country weekend or informal moments in town. Even if the clothes do n't set trends, they will never look out of place, especially with those incomparable silk scarves.

<TEXT>
 Authorities have granted Polish Mormons permission to build their first chapel in this communist country, a church missionary said Tuesday. The only other Soviet bloc country in which there are Mormon chapels is <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where there are about 5,000 members of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. Although Polish authorities registered the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as an official religious organization in 1977, only recently were there enough Polish Mormons to warrant building a chapel, said Elder <PERSON> Juliusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON>, 66, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen of Polish descent, was sent to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to do missionary work by the church headquarters in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He is a retired printer. There are only about 100 Mormons in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, but <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON> said he saw `` great prospects'' for the church's development `` because people are interested in religion here.'' `` You need members first before building a chapel ... Because there is no point having a chapel and it standing empty,'' said <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON>. `` We are very pleased with the cooperation and help we have received from the government,'' he said. At the end of last year, Polish Mormons applied for permission to build a chapel and cultural-educational center in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s western <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> district, <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON> said The local council for Wola approved the project at a meeting last week and forwarded its decision to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> city president for formal approval, he said. <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON> said the chapel, expected to open in 1989 or 1990, would be paid for by donations from Polish Mormons and the church headquarters in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He did not have any estimate of the cost. <PERSON> Fussek </PERSON> said there were about 300-400 Mormons, mostly of German descent, in the country before World War II. The Mormon chapel did not reopen after the war because most of its members fled the country when the Communists took power. More than 35 religious denominations are active in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today. Ninety percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 37 million people are baptized Catholics.

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels today announced proposals for an extended cease-fire that would include amnesty and steps toward a lasting peace. The leftist government's proposal, outlined in a statement to journalists on the second day of peace talks at this post on the Costa Rican border, calls for a 30-day truce with the rebels intended for them to lay down their arms and `` rejoin Nicaraguan society.'' It also provides for the release of a political prisoner for each rebel accepting amnesty. Deputy Foreign Minister Victory <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters there are 3,300 prisoners the government considers eligible for release under the program. The Contra proposal calls for a 45-day truce starting on Good Friday, April 1, in which rebel fighters would move into cesae-fire zones still to be determined. It said the government should grant `` total and unconditional amnesty'' as soon as the truce takes effect, allowing anyone who left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for political reasons to `` rejoin the political, economic and social process without any conditions.'' The rebels also want to join a national dialogue between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and their internal political opponents while the cease-fire lasts. The government also would allow rebel leaders to participate in national reconciliation talks. `` At the moment in which a cease-fire is signed, whether it be for 30, 60 or 90 days, according to what the counterrevolution wants, at that moment the leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance will be able to rejoin civic and political life and even participate in the national dialogue that seeks a reconciliation of all Nicaraguans,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. Both proposals call for international monitoring of the cease-fire. The two sides agreed Monday to a cease-fire during the three days of talks, the first ever held on Nicaraguan territory in more than 6 years of war and the first direct talks without a mediator. Rebel and government negotiators for both sides were optimistic after the first round of peace talks Monday, the first held since December. Also Monday, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> withdrew its soldiers from the Honduran border. The Honduran military reported Sandinista soldiers had retreated. `` The importance of today was that we listened for the first time at the highest level their -LRB- Contras' -RRB- proposal, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s defense minister, said Monday. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a negotiator for the U.S.-backed rebels, called the first round a `` step ahead'' and said the delegations discussed a wide range of issues. `` Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' he said. At stake in the talks is an end to the bloodshed that has claimed an estimated 50,000 dead and wounded and shattered the country's economy. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Arana </PERSON>, a rebel spokesman, said the talks went beyond the bounds earlier established by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and included political issues and `` concepts of democracy.'' `` We spoke about everything,'' he said. The goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> is to work out a viable cease-fire in accordance with the regional peace plan signed last August by the presidents of the five Central American nations. They had said the talks would cover only the mechanics of how the Contras would lay down their arms. The rebels said the talks should include discussion of democratic reforms, also covered in the regional peace plan. `` We came here with an open agenda,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a Contra leader, told reporters. `` And that includes democratization including amnesty. We insisted on speaking about all the problems facing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday signed a document that dealt with a number of internal problems. The statement called on all political parties to refrain from violence, a position targeted at the government supporters who have attacked the opposition. It also calls for the media to respect the government, a reference to the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised to release more than a dozen recently jailed labor leaders and review cases of imprisoned opposition politiciaans. The Sandinistas' willingness to comply with the peace plan was cited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional members as a reason for rejecting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s calls for additional military and nonlethal aid to the rebels. The peace plan also calls for internal dialogue with the political opposition.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said today fellow Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has undergone a `` battlefield conversion'' on the trade issue to try to win votes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lent his support to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a civil rights bill, saying he's `` not going to start differing with the president now. Democratic contenders <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> flew back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to cast their votes for an override. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s loyalty to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` even when the proposals are ... dumb.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was angered by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' change-of-mind on trade legislation and he accused the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of a flip-flop to improve his chances in Saturday's caucuses in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where 138 delegates are at stake. `` Now we're getting some battlefield conversions on trade. ... The acid test on trade is the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment,'' the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman told senior citizens in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Last night, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told reporters, `` On the central issue in this campaign, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is trying to have it both ways. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday endorsed a trade bill put forward by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, which <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said was very similar to his measure. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has opposed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s bill. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Monday as did <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressmen <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>. `` This is no change in my position,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded at his own news conference. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> did not have the spotlight to itself as candidates from both parties are stumping in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, with its primary a week from today, and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a week later. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was making a foray into neighboring <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> today, where he appeared well-positioned to add to his string of wins on his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> home turf. Campaign sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will receive a sought-after endorsement on Wednesday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who has been mentioned as a possible dark-horse Democratic nominee if the convention is deadlocked. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, still searching for a Northern breakthrough after establishing his candidacy in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, met today with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who said afterward he still has n't decided whether to endorse a candidate before the state's April 26 primary On Monday, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator met with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who said some nice things about him but did n't endorse him. Although Connecticut is one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home states _ his father represented it in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and his mother and brother still live in the state _ the vice president said he was taking nothing for granted there. `` I do n't want to be beaten in this state,'' he said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> on Monday. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, reporters asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> whether he backed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a sweeping civil rights bill. `` I'm not going to start differing with the president now,'' he replied. Later <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told black supporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he supports the idea that institutions receiving federal money should comply with civil rights laws. But he said the civil rights measure, passed overwhelmingly by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was flawed. `` The legislation ... is imperfect and the imperfections should be corrected,'' he said. Up until Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not said directly whether he supported the veto. `` I'm not going to start doing now what I have n't been doing for seven years, finding differences with the president, for whom I have great respect,'' he said. The measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds to entire institutions, state and local government agencies and many corporations if any part of them practices discrimination. The administration supports a plan that would grant religious schools and organizations as well as corporations more exemptions from civil rights laws. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believed the president should have line-item veto powers so he could `` take some of the extremes'' out of bills like the one in question. Earlier Monday, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 21 county <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairmen followed suit. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s primary is June 7 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican opponent, down-but-not-out <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he again challenged the vice president to a debate. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has rebuffed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s calls for a faceoff, saying it is time to turn the attention to differences with the Democrats. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was campaigning in the must-win state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, wooing workers at a steel mill and making appearances with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> at his side. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says he likes <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s trade stance, but is n't formally supporting him. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s says his trade views _ raising the threat of sanctions if foreign barriers do n't come down _ are getting a good reception in the industrial state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` The people in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> are interested in someone who is really going to stand up on the trade issue,'' he said in <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made a visit to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which holds Democratic caucuses on April 4, and met Monday with ex-candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was going to advise his campaign on policy matters. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, however, that he was n't formally endorsing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. That, he said, would be `` old-fashioned.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> abandoned his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> bid earlier this month, 10 months after quitting the first time over reports about his relationship with a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> model. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> today. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign on Monday was talking up his plans for a big media buy in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> won his home-state primary in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week without buying any television ads. He has said he hopes for a `` respectable'' showing in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, although he ca n't spend much money in the state.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 73-24 today to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a bill reversing a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that narrowed the scope of laws to prevent federally funded discrimination against women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped. The Civil Rights Restoration Act went directly to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where leaders also said they had the votes to override the veto. Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote tonight `` We expect a vote to override,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 315-98 and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> head-counters said only a dozen members at most were expected to move into the president's corner. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was more than the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. The bill initially passed 75-14. To become law over a president's veto, the legislation must be approved by a two-thirds vote of both chambers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes capped a four-year struggle to overturn the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote came after several senators, including acting Republican Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, condemned what they called a misinformation campaign launched by conservative opponents of the bill. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, who voted to sustain the veto, nonetheless said he was concerned about erroneous claims that it would create `` massive new rights.'' Some opponents have claimed the bill would require churches to hire active homosexual drug addicts with AIDS to counsel children. Proponents of the bill say it offers no protection for homosexuals or drug or alcohol addicts. Even as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prepared to vote, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to sustain his veto. `` I ask every senator and representative to rise above the pressures of an election year, to make a stand for religious liberty by sustaining my veto of this dangerous bill,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech to local Republican officials from around the country. `` The truth is, this legislation is n't a civil rights bill,'' the president said. `` It's a power grab by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, designed to take control away from states, localities, communities, parents and the private sector and give it to federal bureaucrats and judges. `` One dollar in federal aid _ direct or indirect _ would bring entire organizations under federal control, from charitable social organizations to churches and synagogues.'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, R-Ill., said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed the reasons for his veto today in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans and outlined the alternative he proposed last week `` It's rather too bad that that alternative did not get to us earlier on than the time it was presented,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alternative would enable more institutions to escape regulation on religious grounds and limit most corporate compliance requirements to specific plants or facilities receiving federal aid. The court ruled that an organization or governmental body getting federal support must comply with anti-discrimination rules only for the program receiving the federal aid, not for the entire organization. The bill would cut off aid for the whole organization if discrimination against minorities, women, the elderly or the disabled was practiced by any part of the organization. `` Obviously there's a very organized and promoted campaign'' against the bill, said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` Apparently the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> let the word out, as we began getting hundreds of calls -LRB- that -RRB- all said the same thing.'' `` I think a lot of misinformation has been spread,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> added. `` There's a great deal of misinformation, distortion of truth and fact.'' The Civil Rights Restoration Act passed both chambers earlier this year by lopsided margins far greater than the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday said he would support the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto, saying the legislation `` is imperfect and the imperfections should be corrected.'' Supporters of the legislation say it restores civil rights laws to the way they were interpreted before the court challenge mounted by tiny <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB- College. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had tried since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision to pass a corrective measure but became enmeshed in various controversies involving regulation and abortion. The final bill had broad bipartisan support and many Republicans asked the president not to veto it. An eleventh-hour push by the conservative Moral Majority group resulted in thousands of phone calls, letters and telegrams urging lawmakers to uphold the veto. The liberal People for the American Way responded Monday with newspaper ads saying `` the Far Right could defeat civil rights'' unless people call their representatives and `` tell them your tax money must not pay for discrimination.'' The restoration act says entire institutions and government agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within them receives federal aid. Entire corporations are covered if they provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to the business as a whole, as in the Chrysler bailout. Farmers receiving crop subsidies, people using food stamps and other individuals receiving federal assistance would not be subject to regulation. An institution's refusal to perform or pay for abortions would not be considered discriminatory. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision applied specifically to Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments barring sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. It was interpreted also to cover the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring racial discrimination in federally-assisted programs; the 1973 Rehabilitation Act barring discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age Discrimination Act barring employment discrimination against older people.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops here on an emergency training exercise have no plans to pull out despite <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s withdrawal of soldiers from the Honduran border, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military spokesman said today `` Right now the plans are to make it a 10 - to 14-day exercises,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON>, public relations director for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> `` We have not received any directive as to when to begin redeployment.'' He said training exercises between <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers would continue today at four sites, but few details were available. <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> also said five or six of the 10 soldiers injured in a helicopter crash during an exercise could be released to light duty. On Monday, he said they `` are in some pain and discomfort, but they are handling it very well.'' <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said the helicopter, a UH-1 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>, was flying from southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lorenzo </LOCATION> to eastern Jamastran when it hit bad weather and was forced to divert to <LOCATION> Juticalpa </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of the Nicaraguan border. It crashed about six miles south of <LOCATION> Juticalpa </LOCATION> in a pine-covered valley, he said. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> announced Monday its troops had withdrawn from the border, and the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> military reported Sandinista soldiers had retreated. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders also agreed to a cease-fire during three days of peace talks which will end Wednesday at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s southern border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Today, the Sandinista government proposed a 30-day cease-fire and amnesty for rebels. The Contras proposed a 45-day truce during which rebels would move into cease-fire zones. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benevides </PERSON>, the Honduran armed forces spokesman, said Monday the 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops that rushed to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after a reported incursion by 2,000 Sandinista troops wo n't be needed much longer. `` It'll be a very short time. We're talking days only,'' he said in an interview. Also today, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fact-finding team requested by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was to leave for that country to investigate the border violence, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> announced in a statement. It said observations will be limited to the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> side, since no permission was received from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to go there. Meanwhile, Nicaraguan and Contra officials were optimistic after the first round of truce talks held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Monday. The talks resume today. `` The worst -LRB- fighting -RRB- is over and there is peace now in the border region,'' Col. <PERSON> Reynald </PERSON> <PERSON> Andino </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, commander of the Honduran army's 101st Infantry Brigade, said Monday by telephone from his headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We are remaining on a state of alert to be ready for anything that may happen,'' he added, and soldiers are `` constantly patrolling the area.'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> and other officers, some of whom insisted on anonymity for security reasons, said on Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> penetrated an area of about 20 square miles inside <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> province while chasing the U.S.-supported Contra rebels in a two-week offensive to evict the Contras from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. About 200 border incidents have been reported in <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> since the Contras began fighting the leftist Sandinista government in 1981. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the Nicaraguan government have denied Sandinista soldiers crossed the border. The Contras maintain camps in an area called Bocay, which includes territory on both sides of the border. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> claims the camps, which the Contras use to store supplies and to stage raids inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, are in Nicaraguan land, but the rebels say they are in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to a three-day truce on Monday, the first of three days of their latest round of peace talks. At <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a town on the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> border, representatives of the Sandinista government and Contras began their first direct talks on Nicaraguan soil. The purpose is to work out a cease-fire as required by the peace plan that five Central American presidents signed last Aug. 7. After Monday's closed session, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s defense minister, said: `` The importance of today was that we listened for the first time at the highest level their -LRB- Contras' -RRB- proposal,'' he told journalists <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, one of the rebel negotiators, said the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> plan calls for a 30-day truce, political amnesty and continued talks to work out a lasting cease-fire. `` Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. He called the first round a `` step ahead.''

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today gave an `` Uncivil Rights Award'' to the mayor of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for allegedly pressuring Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> into retirement.

Minorities, who make up the bulk of <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s district, have clamored for several years for a minority representative.

<TEXT>
 CBS' plan to liven up its schedule with a rash of new half-hour comedies was a ratings failure in its first week. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, put the critically praised comedy `` The Wonder Years'' into the Nielsen top 10. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week handily. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> finished slightly ahead of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> for the week, but continued to lag in season-to-date ratings and seems destined to finish in last place for the first time. For the week ending March 20, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average, prime-time rating of 15.8. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 12.9 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.6. With four weeks left in the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads with a 16.3, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is second with a 13.9 and CBS third with 13.6. The good news for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was that `` CBS Evening News'' was still in first place with an average rating of 11.6 and a 22 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' was second with 10.8 and 20, and `` NBC Nightly News'' third with 9.7 and 18 Of the new CBS comedies, only `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>,'' which premiered with double episodes on Monday, fared very well. The first episode ranked 41st. The second was 31st with a rating of 14.2 and a 22 share. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with television sets. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The two new comedies and one returning comedy <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> added on Tuesday night were steamrollered by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s normally strong lineup, including `` The Wonder Years,'' a sweet-natured nostalgia comedy set in the late 1960s. It replaced `` Growing Pains,'' which moved to Wednesday night where it continues to be a top-10 show. The top 10 for last week were: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Wonder Years'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Night Court'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Murder, She Wrote'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and `` Growing Pains'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Half of the top 10 shows were repeats, as the networks began to conserve new episodes for the May sweeps. On Tuesday night, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Coming of Age,'' starring <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> as an acerbic former airline pilot struggling to adjust to a sunny retirement village, was 59th out of 77 shows. `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'' was 75th. `` Sam'' had originally done well in the ratings and was brought back from hiatus to fill in for `` The Dictator,'' a new comedy that was delayed by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> strike. `` Trial and Error,'' a Hispanic `` Odd Couple,'' was 76th with a rating of only 6.5 and an 11 share. The critically praised `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' was moved from Monday to Tuesday where the rest of the lineup dragged it down to 65th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did well with its regular lineup and a couple of remakes of hit movies. A new TV version of `` Inherit the Wind,'' this one starring <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, ranked 14th. Tied for 15th place was `` In the Heat of the Night,'' starring <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> in the pilot of the series getting a spring tryout. The bottom-rated shows of the week were: `` The Thorns,'' `` A Place at the Table,'' `` Probe,'' `` West 57th,'' `` The Disney Sunday Movie,'' `` <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON>,'' `` Hotel,'' `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' `` Trial and Error'' and `` Buck <PERSON> James </PERSON>.''

 The Sandinista government, in its second day of peace talks with <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels, today proposed a 30-day truce, and the U.S.-backed Contras said a cease-fire should last 45 days. The Nicaraguan government proposal calls for the rebels to lay down their arms, while the Contras said rebels should move into cease-fire zones during the truce. On Monday, the two sides agreed to a battlefield truce during the three days of the peace talks.

 Police today found six children reported missing when the eldest child, a 13-year-old girl, drove out of a parking lot while their foster parents were inside a hospital. The children had been left in the van Monday while the couple kept a doctor's appointment in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said today. A witness saw the teen-ager drive the van out of the parking lot, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Everybody's safe. Everybody's in good health,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Investigators from the child abuse unit were going to talk with the children, said police spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. A determination will be made if the parents were `` remiss'' in their actions, and where the children should be placed, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. It is unlikely that any action will be taken against the teen-ager, he said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON> said the girl had driven to a friend's home in <LOCATION> Encinitas </LOCATION>, a seaside community about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and the younger children spent the night in the van outside the house The mother of the friend heard a news report about the missing van and called sheriff's deputies. The children's names were not released. The youngest child, an 8-month-old baby, was described as `` medically fragile,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Luth </PERSON> said. He did not know details of the baby's condition. Two of the children are age 12. The others are 4 years and 19 months. Police alerted authorities in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to watch for a yellow, California-registered 1978 Chevrolet van with red, black and orange stripes. The license number was entered into a national computer network of stolen cars. It was not known if the children had any money, <PERSON> Luth </PERSON> said. `` As far as we know, the foster parents took all the kids to <LOCATION> Kaiser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where the father had to see doctor,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Apparently the children wanted to stay in the van, found the key, and drove off.'' He said it was at first assumed the driver would take the children to her biological parents' house in <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, but she did not.

<HEAD>Government Closes Anti-Apartheid Newspaper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Tuesday shut down the New Nation, a combative, church-backed anti-apartheid newspaper, making it the first victim of a campaign to stifle militant publications. The government `` has killed the messenger instead of listening to the message.'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Soal </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member for the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Progessive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who has state-of-emergency powers to censor publications singlehandedly, said in a special decree that further issues of the black-oriented weekly newspaper are `` totally prohibited'' through June 10. Another Cabinet minister, <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, said the New Nation was closed because it advocated violent overthrow of the government and supported communism. `` It is absolutely astonishing that a publication issued under the name of a Christian organization should act in this way,'' he said. The closure came a day after the 2-year-old newspaper, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, lost a court appeal seeking to postpone government action while it challenged the censorship regulations. The New Nation technically could resume publication after three months, but <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> could close it again if its contents in the ensuing issues dissatisfied him. Bishop <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsmond </PERSON>, chairman of the newspapers' publishing board, said the 22-member staff would be retained during the suspension. He declined to predict would would happen to the paper if the suspension was extended. Orsmond accused the government of `` suppressing the voice of the people.'' Authorities have banned four of the New Nation's editions and seized two. Police have raided the paper's offices, and it was the first of six publications warned by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that they could be closed or forced to obey an in-house censor if they continued to publish material he found objectionable. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, whose stepped-up political activities in recent weeks have angered the government, described the New Nation's closure as `` quite scandalous.'' `` Only a government that is scared or already totalitarian, or very close to totalitarian, behaves in the kind of way that ours does,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. With a circulation of about 60,000, the New Nation is the largest newspaper in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to devote virtually its entire content, including sports and entertainment pages, to politically related developments. One regular feature was a learning section, `` to bridge the deficiencies of apartheid education.'' In simple language, it told readers about black activists not covered in school courses and explained how to apply for a job, feed a baby nutritiously, treat an injured riot victim or protect oneself from tear gas. The newspaper's editor, <PERSON> Zwelakhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, has been detained without charge for 16 months. He joined the New Nation after a year as a Neiman Fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, former secretary-general of the now-outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is serving a life prison term along with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for treason and sabotage. State-of-emergency regulations give <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> nearly unlimited powers to deal with newspapers he feels might contribute to unrest. Under the regulations, he does not have to give reasons for his actions. The New Nation lost an initial court challenge of the regulations and intends to pursue its case in an appellate court. But on Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the newspaper's bid to prevent closure during the appeal process. The last edition of the New Nation, on March 17, said the government was `` bent on destroying what little freedom of expression is left in a country where the majority are voteless.'' `` Because the New Nation dared to act as their voice, it has now been damned to silence,'' the paper said. The issue also carried a quotation from President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on the front page: `` I believe in a free press and in free news media.''

 Prosecutors on Tuesday opened an investigation into fraud, influence peddling and financial scandals allegedly involving the brother of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. The Prosecutor General's Office said at least 10 officials have been questioned in an investigation of whether <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, a younger brother of the former president, embezzled funds of the Saemaul Undong development group. Top Saemaul officials are suspected of diverting private and government subsidies to profit-oriented projects, land speculation and other illegal activities. The former president left office Feb. 25 at the end of a seven-year term. He left Tuesday on a private visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he will meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, has pledged to eradicate abuses of power and corruption under previous governments. In a recent move to reduce the ex-president's power, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> removed some <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> supporters from their posts. Some political observers say the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government opened the investigation to disscredit the former president and improve the current government's image. There have been allegations of corruption by the Saemaul group since the former president seized power with military backing in 1980 and installed his brother as <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> head. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> resigned in 1987 after being linked to gangsters. Prosecutor <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-il </PERSON> said government officials also were being investigated to see if they had assisted or protected corruption. `` My investigation team will unearth all malpractices and make public the results of the probe,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> told reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Dong-A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, an influential <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper, said the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> was responsible for a sharp drop in cattle prices in 1983 when he forced government officials to import cattle from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> was formed in 1971 to improve rural and urban living standards, but critics contend the country's authoritarian governments have used the movement to promote government influence. The Party for Peace and Democracy controlled by opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also aided <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> officials when he was a government minister in 1982. The opposition party demanded that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and other family members of the former president be investigated.

<HEAD>High Court Loosens Rules on Picketing Near Washington Embassies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Individual pickets have a right to carry signs within 500 feet of foreign embassies in the nation's capital but police may disperse groups of three or more protesters there, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday. By a vote of 8-0, the justices upheld the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on groups demonstrating within 500 feet of embassies if police have reason to believe the protesters pose a threat to `` the security or peace of the embassy. But by a separate 5-3 vote, the court said the city's anti-picketing prohibition that prevents even one or two people from carrying signs within 500 feet of the embassies violates free-speech protections Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, in her opinion for the court, said a blanket ban on signs that might be offensive to foreign diplomats goes too far. `` It may serve an interest in protecting the dignity of foreign missions, but it is not narrowly tailored,'' she said. `` A less restrictive alternative is readily available.'' For example, she said, it would be constitutional to ban picketing that is designed to intimidate, coerce, threaten or harass a foreign official. That type of ban has been adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for all areas of the nation with the exception of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Officials of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government have said they are considering adopting a law based on the congressional model. Tuesday's ruling allows <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> police to continue to enforce a ban on demonstrations near embassies when at least three people take part and police fear there will be disruptions. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said police must `` reasonably believe that a threat to the security or peace of the embassy is present.'' Banning such gatherings `` does not prohibit peaceful congregations,'' she said. The ban `` is limited to groups posing a security threat.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> rejected arguments that such a ban gives police too much discretion to break up demonstrations. She said the test for deciding whether a demonstration is illegal `` is whether normal embassy activities have been or are about to be disrupted.'' The ruling partially overturned a 1986 decision by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> upholding all aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on protests near embassies. That ruling was written by former Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, who recently retired from the appeals court. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first choice to fill a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> vacancy last year but was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in a bitter fight. Tuesday's decision is believed to be the first time the high court gave full review to an opinion written by <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. His backers during the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation fight emphasized that he had never been reversed by the high court. The appeals court ruling that <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> wrote in the embassy case said free-speech interests of the demonstrators were outweighed by the need to protect foreign emissaries. The 500-foot restrictions were challenged by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boos </PERSON>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooker </PERSON>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. They wanted to carry signs in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> saying `` Release <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>,'' referring to Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who was allowed in 1986 to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, ending his internal exile in the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>. The demonstrators also planned to picket the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> with placards saying `` Stop the Killing'' in opposition to the Sandinista government there. The conservatives also said they were not receiving equal treatment with opponents of the South African government who have demonsrated near that nation's embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Many of those protesting South African racial policy have been arrested and then freed without being prosecuted. Joining <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> in both phases of Tuesday's ruling were Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Dissenting and voting to uphold the ban on individual picketing were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not take part in the decision. In other action, the court: _ Unanimously ruled in a case from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> that states are barred from regulating the way interstate natural gas companies issue securities to finance their operations _ Heard arguments in a case from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on whether the so-called Miranda warnings police give criminal suspects are adequate to insure their right to legal help A decision is expected to be announced by July.

Under state rules, local delegates who supported a candidate who did n't reach a 15 percent threshold would be non-entities at the district conventions April 23. The state decided Monday that those local delegates would be unable to vote at the district conventions and would be ignored in computing national delegates from the districts. But after conferring with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which interprets the national rules for electing delegates to the national convention, the state party decided Tuesday that all local delegates will be allowed to vote Thus, the delegates pledged to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and uncommitted could possibly form larger blocs that could secure national delegates. An initial calculation by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> based on candidates' strength at the local level showed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 16 national delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 14, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> five and uncommitted four.

 `` Colors,'' a movie about street gangs starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, could prompt more street warfare, some officials complain. `` The violence was certainly graphic, but no more graphic than on the streets,'' City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said Monday, a day after a private screening for the film, which uses real gang members as extras and real gang names. `` It portrayed the dead end of getting involved in gangs,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. `` It was a pretty depressing movie from that standpoint.'' Gang violence has claimed more than 50 lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> this year. The Orion Pictures movie is scheduled for release April 15, and anti-gang specialists fear violence could erupt at theaters if rival gang members go to see it. `` It could create some problems,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. `` It's the kind of thing we need to be concerned about and careful. We're just going to wait and see and monitor the situation.'' Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said `` Colors'' glorified gangs at times. `` I'd be surprised if we do n't have some people die because of this movie,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case Examining Adequacy of Miranda Warning</HEAD>

 A warning advising suspects that they may remain silent and are entitled to an attorney is not adequate to protect their rights under the Constitution, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told on Tuesday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, public defender appealing the 1983 murder conviction of a gang member, said the `` Miranda warning'' does protect a person from self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. But he argued that, once a suspect is indicted, the warning alone is not enough to protect the Sixth Amendment guarantee of legal help. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is using the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case to decide whether the warnings that police have been required to give since 1966 are adequate to advise suspects of their right to legal aid. It ruled in `` Miranda vs. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'' that people accused of crimes must be informed of their rights to remain silent, to have a lawyer, to have counsel present during questioning and to receive free legal assistance if needed. <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON> contended that even if a defendant has waived his rights under <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, he has an automatic right to a lawyer as soon as he is indicted and may not be asked from that point on to submit to interrogation. `` There is a shield around the accused through which the police can not get a waiver,'' <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON> said. `` At no time after the indictment should the police be allowed to go to the defendant, seek a waiver and begin to question.'' However, a prosecutor said authorities would be unfairly limited if they can not interrogate a defendant who is read his rights and then agrees to speak without a lawyer present. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, also said the warning is perfectly understandable to defendants. `` They have a common-sense meaning that enables defendants to understand they have both a right to counsel and that things could go against them if they do n't have a lawyer with them when they're in custody and questioned,'' <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON> said police coerced his client, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, into making incriminating statements by telling him he had been indicted. But <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> understood his rights and agreed to be questioned anyway. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a member of the Vice Lords street gang, is serving a 24-year sentence at the <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for his conviction in the Aug. 21, 1983 beating death of rival <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobsters </PERSON> gang member <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` Pudge'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. According to court briefs, he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge following a gang fight, received a `` Miranda warning'' and signed a statement waiving his right to counsel. Two days later, after initially refusing to discuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> was told he had been indicted, signed a second Miranda waiver and agreed to answer questions, the briefs said

 The hot debate between mayoral and council candidates in <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> is whether to use a 12-acre sodded area for polo or soccer. `` This is the horsiest county in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We have more horses per person in our community than they do in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, 66, mayor of this town of 700 about 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Voters will decide April 5 whether to retain <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, the town's first and only mayor, or replace him with one of two challengers: <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, 43, or <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 36. Seven people are running for the four open seats on the town council, including three of the incumbents and four challengers. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, who has won ribbons as a carriage and sulky race driver, takes credit for starting a regional park from 150 acres dedicated to the town by developers, then cultivating about 12 acres into a low-cost `` utility field'' for soccer or softball. But he also hopes the grassy field can be used to host an annual polo match to lure thousands of spectators to <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> as part of a drive for economic development. The challengers say such schemes indicate <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> is a better promoter than mayor and claim he has ignored the town's mundane recreational needs.

 For years, <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Culberson </PERSON> has been teaching kids at <LOCATION> Karval </LOCATION> High School how to make ethanol in a class on energy conservation. But when the industrial arts teacher got a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> saying his school would have to pay $ 500 a year because it was a fuel alcohol producer, he became a little upset. So <PERSON> Culberson </PERSON> did what ever civics teacher recommends: he wrote his senator. <PERSON> Culberson </PERSON> wrote Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> that the school could not afford the tax and could lose its permit to produce fuel alcohol. His class makes a few quarts a year, he said. Without the permit, he said, students in this eastern plains community would miss an important lesson. `` At a time when it seems important to reduce foreign oil imports, reduce pollution in our states, when education is struggling to better itself with diminishing budgets, why was there a tax of this nature levied on fuel alcohol plants and educational facilities in particular?'' <PERSON> Culberson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> has responded by drafting an amendment that would exempt from the tax producers who make less than 10,000 gallons of fuel alcohol per year. `` This is a classic case of the bureaucracy gone berserk,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his resignation and kept <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> shut down Tuesday with a general strike intended to force him out An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by the strike, which appeared to be gaining support on its second day. Most shops and stores were closed, public transportation was halted and many government employees did not go to work. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is out of cash because of pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as commander of its 15,000 soldiers and police. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar is the national currency and the supply has been cut off. Most government workers were paid only $ 75 of their midmonth wages last week and the $ 33 million end-of-the-month payroll for the 130,000 public employees problably wo n't be met. Pension checks due Wednesday have been delayed, at least until March 28. Hunger is spreading among workers as well as the poor, unemployed and elderly. Many washerwomen, cleaning women, maids and cooks have lost their jobs because there is no money with which to pay them. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, the civilian <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> chose to run the government, said on television Monday night the general would resign in exchange for `` a national dialogue'' to reconcile differences with opponents of the regime. He prefaced the offer with a diatribe against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The implication was that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under federal court indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on narcotics and money laundering charges, would stay in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and might retain power behind the scenes. Calling the offer a `` noble gesture,'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> pledged `` as an officer and a gentleman'' to resign before presidential elections scheduled for May 1989. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who has the title `` minister in charge of the presidency,'' said he would not accept <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation unless `` all of the political forces in the country'' join `` a national dialogue.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> put <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> in office Feb. 26, after President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general and the legislature dismissed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> instead. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, still recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. His dismissal began a run on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks and they were closed the next week. Pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has included freezing virtually all Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including revenue from the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration spokesmen rejected the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> proposal. Last week, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for him to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and live in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The general said his plan was a `` Panamanian solution'' to the crisis. `` I have no reason to talk to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters after <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s speech. `` I talk to Panamanians.'' <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposed discussion would occur in a panel of 33 members, 22 of them supporting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` This is not a dialogue,'' he said `` It's just cynicism.'' <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said: `` The general has to go _ immediately, not eventually. <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> is a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of 200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called the general strike. It was organized last June to lead the campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> spoke on television for 30 minutes, devoting all but the last five minutes to castigating the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of `` economic aggression'' in `` an undeclared state of war.'' He claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to renege on the 1977 treaties under which the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> will be turned over to this country at midnight Dec. 31, 1999. The canal, guarded by about 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, has been operating normally despite the crisis. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent 300 more soldiers Monday, most of them security personnel. Because of increasing hunger, the Rev. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Verar </PERSON> said his Roman Catholic church in the poor <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> suburb is feeding more families every day. `` If we had not done this there would have been chaos, even cases of death,'' he said. `` We have people who have gone five, six days without food.'' Longshoremen, on strike for more than a week, voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to stay out but accepted part payment of back wages despite fears of compromising their position. `` There are mothers and fathers who have to feed their children,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Asprilla </PERSON>, a union leader. In some parts of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, workers formed vigilante groups to guard stores and other places of employment. Looting occurred during street protests against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last week.

 A bladder cancer treatment that avoids surgery has shown promising results in a preliminary study, a scientist said Tuesday. Twenty-one of 36 patients who have completed the drug-and-radiation therapy were found free of disease for three to 21 months, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Prout </PERSON>, professor of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Three others showed partial remission, while treatment failed outright for nine patients. The other three were not evaluable, he told science writers at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The study focused on patients whose cancers had invaded the bladder muscle, a condition usually treated by surgically removing the bladder, <PERSON> Prout </PERSON> said. If the bladder is removed, the patient must wear a bag to collect urine for the rest of his life. It also essentially ends sexual activity. The experimental treatment attacks liver cancer with radiation to the pelvis, plus treatment with a mix of the drugs methotrexate, velban and cis-platinum.

 Nearly 300,000 people have become sick and 11 have died in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s 2-month-old hepatpresses soon will be turning out new editions of highly popular works by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulgakov </PERSON>, author of `` The Master and <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, who won the 1958 Nobel Literature Prize for his novel `` Doctor Zhivago.'' It has not yet been published in book form in his homeland. The newspapers did not say whether foreign literature was included among the books to be made available. Foreign writers such as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Zola </PERSON> are very popular in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and some have been available for years. No details were given on the pricing system to be used for books published by their authors. `` This is not going to be a cheap venture for the author,'' Pravda warned. `` Depending on the number of copies and the volume, such a publication will cost roughly 2,000 rubles and more.'' That sum, the equivalent of $ 3,340, represents nearly a year's pay for the average industrial worker The author in return will receive 20 percent of the sales income, Pravda said. The program has not yet been put into the form of law, Pravda noted, but already state publishing houses have many applications from authors who want to pay to see their works in print. By offering an alternative to creation of publishing cooperatives, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> retains a monopoly on what gets into print. On a related subject, the newspaper Soviet Culture disclosed Tuesday that GlavLit, the state body which for decades has been responsible for censorship, is conducting a review of 6,000 books held in `` special detention'' storehouses. Most of the fiction and non-fiction titles were banned during the 29-year dictatorship of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and removed from library shelves and book kiosks because their authors were deemed to have espoused politically hazardous ideas. `` The vast majority of those books were works whose authors were subjected to repression during the years of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s personality cult,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solodin </PERSON>, a member of the review committee, told Soviet Culture. `` The others had other ` faults,' for example, forewords written by such repressed politicians, quotes from their works or their photographs.'' Among the blacklisted books were 180 that contained references to <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and 70 that mentioned <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON>, two prominent political figures from the early years of the Soviet government executed by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> but recently rehabilitated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. GlavLit, or the Chief Directorate for the Protection of State Secrets in Publishing, was created in 1922 to ensure freedom of the Soviet press from ideological impurity. It has served since as the chief censorship agency, and would have banned the blacklisted books in the first place. A GlavLit committee went through 4,000 of the ba readers, but said the review was helping to resolve the deficit in good literature. The 500 books left in special detention are mostly `` profoundly instigatory literature and nationalistic writings,'' that could be used for ill purposes if allowed into general distribution, <PERSON> Solodin </PERSON> said. The decision to keep them under wraps is not final, and the GlavLit committee will take another look at them once the initial screening is completed, <PERSON> Solodin </PERSON> said.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that he was bestowing an `` Uncivil Rights Award'' on the mayor of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for pressuring Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to retire because he is white. Chairman <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, who is black, said that <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> receives the `` Victim of Uncivil Rights Award'' for the way in which he was treated by `` <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> power brokers'' who have decided that `` he is not their representative _ he's just the wrong color.'' At a news conference where he criticized the Civil Rights Restoration Act and the resignation under pressure of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said he was instituting his own personal `` Uncivil Rights Award'' program in an effort to highlight `` the absurdities committed in the name of civil rights.'' <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>'s first recipient was <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who is black. <PERSON> James </PERSON> has said the courts carved out <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s 10th Congressional District more than 12 years ago to elect a minority congressman, and that `` it's time to get that done.'' <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> worked `` with several other <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> politicians'' in pressuring <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> to retire. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> announced March 14 that he would not seek a 21st term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Minorities, who make up the bulk of <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s district, have clamored for several years for a minority representative. `` <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> has been pressured to retire so that a proper _ read this black _ representative can be elected,'' said <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>. `` The notion that <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> does n't represent the people in the 10th District is absurd. They have elected him to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 20 times, and continue to support his leading role on civil rights issues.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> declined to respond to the criticism from <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the mayor. `` I will not dignify his comments with a response,'' she quoted <PERSON> James </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> also declined comment, said spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said he would bestow his new awards `` as often as they are properly earned _ perhaps once a month. If the Civil Rights Restoration Act passes today over the president's veto, I suppose I will have more than enough material.'' <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said the Civil Rights Restoration Act represents `` an unwarranted invasion ... by Big Brother.'' The statute forbids distribution of federal funds to entire institutions, state and local government agencies and many corporations if any part of them practices discrimination. It was spurred by a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that civil rights laws applied only to a specific program or activity receiving federal aid. The head of the civil rights panel also said that one of his candidates for a `` Victim of Uncivil Rights'' Award had been <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, who was named the first woman president in the 124-year history of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for the deaf, only to resign following protests over the fact that she was not deaf.

<HEAD>Test-Tube Baby Pioneer Dies At 74</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, the doctor who delivered the world's first test-tube baby in 1978 and helped pioneer a technique that revolutionized infertilty treatment, has died of cancer. He was 74. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, a gynecologist and obstetrician who pioneered the in vitro fertilization technique with physiologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, died Monday night at <ORGANIZATION> Chaucer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, he was to have been decorated by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> as a Commander of the British Empire, an honor one step below a knighthood, for services to his country. An expert in infertility, <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> also was to have received the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s Gold Medal, one of the profession's highest awards, at its annual meeting in July `` Mr. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> made an invaluable contribution to medicine and raised the honor and dignity of the profession,'' the association said. British surgeons use the designation `` Mr.'' instead of `` Dr.'' The test-tube baby technique gave hope to millions of childless couples and spawned a range of fertility treatments for both men and women. More than 1,000 test-tube babies have been born as a result of treatment at <ORGANIZATION> Bourn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, run by <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, and thousands of others have born elsewhere in the world. `` It is a very great loss to <PERSON> Bourn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and to me personally,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` In the last three years, he was working under considerable difficulties but carried on. `` He wished to do service to his patients for as long as possible.'' Truck driver <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, father of <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the world's first test-tube baby, said he and his wife, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>, `` are forever in his debt. `` There is no way we, or any other couples Mr. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> helped, can possibly repay him for what he has given them,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> was born on July 25, 1978, in <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Four years later, the <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> had a second test-tube baby, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>. The birth of <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the first human conceived outside the womb, was hailed as a medical breakthrough on the order of the first heart transplant. But some people were horrified, seeing it as the dawn of a `` Brave New World'' of baby farms and genetic engineering. `` I am not a wizard or a Frankenstein,'' <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> once said. `` All I want to do is help women whose child-producing mechanism is slightly faulty.'' Under the in vitro fertilization technique, which actually involves no test tubes, eggs are removed from the prospective mother and fertilized with the intended father's sperm in a glass dish. The resulting embryo is then implanted in the mother's womb. It took 10 years for <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> to develop the technique. Working at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> worked out the procedure for fertilizing eggs in a laboratory dish, and <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> adapted a technique known as laparoscopy, a way of seeing and operating inside the abdomen by inserting a tube with a fiber optic light. Originally intended for women who were unable to conceive because of blocked Fallopian tubes, in vitro fertilization has given rise to such procedures as embryo freezing, egg and sperm donation, embryo transfer and surrogate motherhood. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, who was born on June 9, 1913, qualified as a doctor in 1939 and immediately went into World War II service as a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surgeon. He was a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from 1941 to 1943, and was discharged with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander in 1946. He worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals, moving in 1951 to <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>, a northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city where in the fall of 1967 he teamed up with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. In 1984, a furor erupted over allegations that they had experimented on embryos, although the scientists later insisted they had only observed embryos. The same year, the team proposed implanting embryos into animals to determine whether some conditions favorable to fertility exist in the animal's uterus but not in a woman's. The idea eventually was dropped. But <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> never thought their work was in any way unethical. `` We are not creating life,'' he said. `` We have merely done what many people try to do in all kinds of medicine _ to help nature.'' <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> said the greatest contribution of their work would likely be in early embryo research into genetic diseases. He is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Sheena </PERSON>, and a son and daughter. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Car Dealer's Lions Raises Art Institute Roar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A car salesman did n't think he'd be stepping on any paws when he put a pair of seven-foot lion statues on the roof of his auto dealership and advertised `` The Car Institute.'' But a roar of sorts erupted from the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, which has lions guarding its entrance. `` I did n't think people would be confused,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the car dealer, who said Tuesday he had agreed to a compromise. `` I do n't know how much of their traffic we've been getting. I think there's room for both of us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> contended ads for the `` Car Institute'' violated a museum trademark. `` We agreed to discontinue the ` <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>,''' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` But they've agreed to let us keep the lions'' on the building in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mars </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for administrative affairs, said the advertising was the real problem. To allow <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> to capitalize on the institution's image might allow others to do the same, and in an offensive way, <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> said. `` I think it maybe sends a signal out to people who all-too-frequently try to use images from our collection that are n't terribly appropriate,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> said a mistake was made long ago when the museum did not protect its copyright of the painting `` American Gothic'' by <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. `` Now we can no longer say anything about how'' parodies use the stern-faces farm couple, <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said he got the call from the museum attorney about a month ago. Last week he had his fiberglass lions painted the colors of nearby <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` to help clear up the confusion.'' One is now white, the other purple. `` We hope they do n't object,'' he said. Mars said the lions, even in purple and white, can stay.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four Palestinians who had sought political asylum in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> were ordered expelled Tuesday for undisclosed security reasons, a government official said. The order came after Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s government met in a special session to consider their appeal against a ruling by police and immigration authorities that they leave the country, said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Lempert </PERSON>, a senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. A fifth Palestinian was granted a resident's visa for humanitarian reasons, despite objections by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lempert </PERSON> said. He said the government normally granted asylum to stateless Palestinians arriving from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since the 1982 Israeli invasion of that country, but police objections `` weighed heavier'' in these cases. One of the four was married to a Swedish woman expecting their child in April. <PERSON> Lempert </PERSON> declined to specify the suspicions against the Palestinians. Lawyers representing them were ordered not to comment, but the attorneys were quoted by the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> as saying they would appeal.

<TEXT>
 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on Tuesday rather than return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> override vote of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of civil rights legislation, saying `` I was n't needed.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> indicated both opposition and support for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the civil rights bill in a confusing series of statements. On a radio call-in show, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he would vote to override the veto if he were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he added, `` If it were the deciding vote, I would side with the president.'' He later elaborated, saying the only reason he would vote to sustain <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto would be to `` give -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- a chance to rework the bill.'' In a speech to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> businessmen, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` That bill is not nearly as bad as advertised.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, his spokeswoman also issued a double-edged statement. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Republican leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, `` opposes the president on this issue'' and would like to reverse the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that prompted the legislation. But she said, `` If his vote were needed to sustain the veto, he would.'' `` In principle he opposes the president,'' she said. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had more than enough votes to provide the two-thirds majority needed to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, with or without <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who was campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in advance of the state's April 5 Republican presidential primary. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the faraway front-runner for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, announced on Monday that he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. `` I'm not going to start differing with the president after 7 1 @ 2 years into the vice presidency,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was criticized by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the campaign for failing to take a clear-cut position on key issues such as tax increases and arms control. And a variety of statements by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and allies left a confused impression on the hotly debated civil rights bill. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> whip, said he had been authorized to say on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor that `` were he -LRB- Dole -RRB- present and voting, he would vote to sustain the president's veto.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> himself issued a statement for the record which did not say how he would vote. `` I have always supported legislation to overturn <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to restore the broad civil rights coverage that existed prior to that case,'' he said. `` At the same time, I recognize that -LRB- the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bill -RRB- is not a perfect bill. I am not fully satisfied with it ... But the fact remains that the administration and its congressional allies had the opportunity to offer amendments and they were voted down.'' The legislation stems from a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that says that an organization receiving federal aid must follow anti-discrimination rules only for the program that receives the aid, and not for the entire organization or institution. The legislation would erase that distinction and require that an entire organization follow the rules. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was absent when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill in January. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the bill, saying it was too broad and infringed on the activities of religious groups, small buisnesses and others. Civil rights groups have strongly suppored the bill and favor overriding <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday increased official pressure on <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to halt ethnic unrest that has left at least 32 people dead. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian federation, the nation's largest republic, and equivalent bodies in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> called on the national parliament to take firm action to end the tension. The moves came amid increasingly negative coverage in the official press of Armenian demands to annex the predominantly Armenian <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, which is part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the reported arrest of a leading Armenian nationalist. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, wife of Armenian-born dissident <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, said in an interview that <PERSON> Paryur </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday evening by three policemen in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after meeting with a Western journalist. She said <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> was accused of crossing the street illegally, and that he informed her of his arrest by calling from a pay telephone as the policemen stood by. <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> said Saturday he had traveled clandestinely to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after his passport was confiscated in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday criticized <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists who it said gathered almost 4,000 people for a meeting in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on March 19 to devise strategy to press their demands. On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda charged the Armenians' campaign has a `` clear anti-socialist spirit.'' Ethnic rioting broke out in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, a Azerbaijani city, after Armenians began protesting last month for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Officials say 32 people were killed, but Armenian activists say the death toll was much higher and that most of the dead were Armenians killed by Azerbaijanis. The Russian federation expressed `` concern and alarm'' over the ethnic unrest and asked the Presidium of the national Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, to `` adopt resolute measures aimed at ... uniting in all ways the Soviet peoples.'' The Soviet constitution says little about the rights of autonomous regions such as <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, but says the territory of a republic such as <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> may not be changed without its consent. That means <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> would have to approve the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Under Soviet law, each of the country's 15 republics is ostensibly sovereign. But the appeals from the five Soviet republics about <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> seemed designed to serve as a reason for the national government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to act on the simmering territorial dispute. The policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejected the demand for annexation on Feb. 20, but Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised on Feb. 26 that the issue would be considered when the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> holds another meeting to discuss national disputes. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a regular news briefing that protests continued in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Sunday and Monday. A nationalist source said Armenians would gather again in their capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Saturday to decide whether to call a general strike. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the situation in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> still is too tense to allow foreign journalists to travel there. `` A curfew is still in effect in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, although the situation there is regarded as absolutely normal,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> I would n't call it normal because there are demonstrations going on and that's not normal.'' <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that 7,000 people had gathered in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to protest the Pravda article published earlier that day criticizing the movement to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. At a Tuesday news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> before his reported arrest, <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON>, 38, a former political prisoner, read what he said was the text of a telegram from Armenian journalist <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arakyelan </PERSON> to Pravda Editor <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON>, the correspondent said the article was an `` editor's article expressing the will of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' rather than the views of those whose names were attached to it. Arikyan, chairman of an Armenian nationalist group called <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Determination </ORGANIZATION>, said the Pravda article was an indication that authorities will not agree to unite <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, despite appeals from local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials. <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> once headed an underground Armenian nationalist group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and was jailed for 17 years beginning in 1969 for his political activities. He said Armenian activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> claim 78 people were killed in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. But, he said, `` I think a worse tragedy than <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> awaits us.''

The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> official was quoted as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` should systematically absorb the beneficial experience and knowledge from modern capitalism,'' which he praised for guaranteeing an enivronment of free competition, allowing production forces to develop, and creating a good legal system. `` In the past, we believed capitalism would quickly die out,'' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Looking from today's perspective, modern capitalism has a lot of room to develop.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last year reaffirmed its commitment to opening up the country and pushing market-oriented reforms to stimulate the economy. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s comments not only indicated strong support for reform but also appeared designed to allay fears about what will happen to this bastion of capitalism after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes over in 1997. Much of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s well-educated middle class are seeking to move overseas before the territory reverts to Chinese rule, even though <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has promised the territory can retain its capitalist economic system and enjoy `` a high degree of autonomy.'' But many of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million people are refugees from political campaigns in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and remain pessimistic. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> acknowledged they have `` a kind of distrust of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is completely understandable.'' He said residents will be allowed to criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and socialism after 1997, but will be asked to `` love <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and love <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.'' `` This is what we call ` one country, two systems,''' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` This will benefit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cooperation with every circle of people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, especially the middle class.''

<HEAD>House Votes To Continue Incentives For Rare-Disease Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 401-1 Tuesday to continue and expand a program to encourage private companies to develop drugs for combatting rare diseases. The bill, which was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, extends the so-called `` orphan drug'' program through fiscal 1990. It would also expand the program, which is overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to include special devices and foods needed to help people with unusual maladies. Under the program, companies are given tax credits and seven-year exclusive marketing rights if they develop products for rare diseases. Without incentives, the companies would not pursue development of those products because the small number of beneficiaries would not make it profitable, according to supporters of the legislation. The revised statute, while expanding the program, would triple its cost in the next few years. The current annual authorization of $ 4 million would grow to $ 14 million in fiscal 1990. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said it has no objection to the legislation. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the health subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, had also sought to include a provision to limit profits on orphan drugs However, the restrictions were opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> dropped them rather than face possible stalling tactics when the bill reached the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The only dissenting vote was cast by Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>.

 A court on Tuesday fined <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> $ 15,750 for illegally selling sensitive technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and ordered suspended sentences for two former <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> executives. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Yonezawa </PERSON> found that <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>'s actions `` seriously damaged the economic activities, foreign relations and trade policies of our nation, which is trying to protect free trade and international cooperation.'' Between 1982 and 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-largest electronics maker, sold $ 17 million in sophisticated milling machines to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, part of them allegedly through <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vaapenfabrikk </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials alleged the machines helped <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> build propellers that make submarines quieter and harder to detect. Since the statute of limitations on that action had expired, however, the current case involved charges that parts and software were sold later in violation of foreign trade and exchange laws based on the regulations of the Western allies' Coordinating Committee for Exports to Communist Nations. The defense argued that the machine parts and software could have been produced by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and there had been no violation worthy of serious legal consideration. But <PERSON> Yonezawa </PERSON> said, `` The violation can not be dismissed as trivial, since it involved misleading explanations made by <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> officials to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> and the destruction of related papers after the incident was uncovered.'' <PERSON> Yonezawa </PERSON> added that <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>'s actions `` fed distrust of the Japanese government and industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He held that the sale occurred `` with the approval of the company's president and under the direction of the corporation's top executives. <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanimura </PERSON>, former deputy senior project manager of the company's <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was sentenced to one year in prison, with the sentenced suspended for three years. <PERSON> Ryuzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, a former manager in <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>'s Material Supply Division, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, also suspended for three years. Following the decision, <PERSON> Joichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has been taking the utmost efforts to assure that no such incident will recur, and there will be no change in this policy in the future.'' Earlier, in the milling machine case, the Japanese government banned <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> from exporting to any communist nations for one year.

 A bill authorizing $ 3.5 million in transitional expenses for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor and $ 1 million for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to move to retirement in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> next January was approved Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic-controlled committee rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> move to increase the expense allowance for the outgoing president to $ 1.5 million from $ 1 million, the level in effect since 1976, to offset the effects of inflation. The proposed boost was opposed by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the panel's chairman, who said the budget squeeze requires <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` make some hard choices'' on spending cuts.

<TEXT>
 The military services had no problem meeting their recruiting goals last last year, but there were `` some adverse signs'' for the future in lower re-enlistment results, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Releasing its latest quarterly report, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> signed up 66,300 recruits during the first quarter of fiscal 1988, which ended Dec. 31. That compares with a combined goal of 65,400, and all four services met or exceeded their individual quarterly objectives, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Moreover, the percentage of first-time enlistees with a high school diploma actually increased slightly _ from 92 percent during the period in fiscal 1987 to 93 percent in fiscal 1988. `` Retention -LRB- re-enlistment -RRB- results for the first quarter of fiscal 1988 were also satisfactory, but with some adverse signs,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, assistant defense secretary for manpower, said in a statement. `` First-term re-enlistment rates trailed comparable fiscal 1987 statistics for three of the four services. And while overall career retention rates showed some improvement over fiscal 1987, retention among second-term and career <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> petty officers continued to decline after falling short of objectives last year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> pays particular attention to the percentage of men and women willing to re-enlist after completing their initial obligation, viewing it as a measure not only of military readiness and experience in the force but also job satisfaction. According to the latest report, 46 percent of military personnel eligible to re-enlist for the first time during the period did so _ down from 49 percent during the comparable period in fiscal 1987. Some of the individual service declines, however, were much more precipitous. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s first term re-enlistment rate dropped from 74 percent to 62 percent over the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' rate dropped from 24 percent to 18 percent, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s rate fell from 56 percent to 51 percent. The Army managed to buck the trend with a small increase, from 40 percent in fiscal 1987 to 43 percent this fiscal year. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> noted that various re-enlistment bonus programs had been suspended for 65 days during the period awaiting congressional action. `` But most retention measures have fallen several percentage points below their 1983-84 peaks, and this trend has been particularly noticeable among personnel in higher-technology skills that are in particular demand in the private sector,'' he added. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, restated the administration's strong opposition to a cut in the 4.3 percent pay raise proposed for military personnel in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The 4.3 percent hike exceeds the 2 percent proposed for civilian government workers and some congressional leaders are now arguing military and civilian workers should be treated the same. `` The comparability studies ... show an 11 percent gap between military and civilian pay,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The 4.3 percent pay raise is fully justified unless we want to return to the situation that we saw in the past where the disparity was so great that good people could n't afford to stay in the military.''

<TEXT>
 Extracts of a tropical plant appeared to reduce levels of hepatitis virus and liver cancer rates in woodchucks, a hopeful sign for the world's 200 million human virus-carriers at risk for the cancer, a scientist said Tuesday. The trends emerged in analysis of data on about 60 animals that had become infected with the woodchuck version of the hepatitis B virus, said <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Woodchucks are used in hepatitis research because the virus they carry so closely resembles the human hepatitis B virus. <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON> stressed that the results are only suggestive, and a prelude to a formal study of the plant extract's effects. `` Even if it does n't get rid of the virus altogether, it may still be useful,'' he said after speaking to science writers at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. That is because the virus now can lie dormant for decades after infection, and if the extract can extend that period, it may essentially block the progression to liver cancer until after a person has died of something else, he said. Infection with hepatitis virus B has long been linked to later development of cancer originating in the liver, as opposed to cancer that starts elsewhere in the body and spreads to the liver. Studies in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have found that male carriers of the virus run more than 200 times the risk of developing liver cancer than non-carriers, giving them a 40 percent chance of dying from the disease, <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON> said. The cancer is particularly common in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, he said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the cancer society expects about 6,000 new cancers of the liver this year. The best way to deal with the problem is vaccination at birth for people at risk of the disease, <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON> said. Such a vaccine is not recommended for the American population generally because the overall risk is so low, he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have programs for vaccinating newborn children, he said. His institution has established a vaccine program in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> directed at newborn children of carrier mothers and others in their household. He said he hopes other such programs will be established. But the world already has about 200 million carriers of the virus, and more will be added every day until vaccination programs become fully effective, he said. The plant, called Phyllanthus ammarus, grows in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and throughout the tropical world, <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON> said. It can be grown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. The extract of the plant appears to fight the virus by blocking a substance called DNA polymerase that the virus needs to reproduce itself, he said. When the extract was injected into the bellies of woodchucks infected for a month, evidence of the virus disappeared, he said. Those infected longer showed decreases in the amount of virus in their blood. Treated animals also developed significantly fewer liver cancers than others, <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON> said. Limited studies in animals suggest the extract does not cause significant side effects, he said. Scientists are trying to isolate the portion of the extract that fights the virus, he said. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Koff </PERSON>, a liver disease specialist and professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the work should be followed up with more study. `` Innovative, exciting stuff has to be looked at,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Gas Distributor In Fatal Explosion Issues Nationwide Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gas distribution company has warned customers nationwide that cylinders of silane gas may have been contaminated the same way as one that exploded, killing three people, officials said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> issued the warning Monday that the cylinders of silane may have been contaminated with an unstable oxidizer, said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Erzinger </PERSON>, the company's director of public relations. <PERSON> Erzinger </PERSON> said he could not estimate the number Liquid Carbonic customers across the country, but said most are in the electronics industry. The company manufactures industrial and medical gases, such as silane, which is widely used to coat silicon wafers. <PERSON> Erzinger </PERSON> said company officials are investigating the origin of the cylinder that exploded Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Gollob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> plant, killing three people and seriously injuring a fourth. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively traced the cylinder _ believed to contain a volatile mixture of nitrous oxide and silane _ through three states before it reached <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. The exact cause of the blast remains unknown, say officials with the <ORGANIZATION> DEP </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonics </ORGANIZATION>. In its note to its customers, <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonic </ORGANIZATION> said the explosion may have been caused by some kind of oxidizer being drawn back into the cylinder. `` If your process utilizes silane gas product in conjunction with oxidizers, such as nitrous oxide or oxygen, you are urged to make certain that oxidizers can not be drawn back into your silane gas container,'' the notice said. Meanwhile Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonic </ORGANIZATION> completed removal of 300 cylinders of silane from its Harrison plant, <PERSON> Erzinger </PERSON> said. He said the company may conduct similar removals at other plants around the country. On Monday, nearly 1,000 workers were held off their jobs on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> after canisters containing potentially explosive chemicals were discovered at semiconductor facilities there. Chemical inspectors eventually concluded that the four canisters at <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> in Mountain View were harmless. A similar precautionary evacuation took place Sunday in <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, when officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Gould </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s semiconductor plant examined silane cylinders belonging to Liquid Carbonic. One of the men killed in Thursday's blast, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON>, was a regional manager for <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbonic </ORGANIZATION> at the company's <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> facility. The two others killed were <PERSON> Gollob </PERSON> employees. A Liquid Carbonic deliveryman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Diemer </PERSON>, lost a leg and suffered shrapnel wounds. He was in fair condition Tuesday in the plastic surgery ward of <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> got the meeting he'd sought with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> on Monday, but he got no endorsement for his presidential bid despite complimentary words from the governor. `` He's very bright,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` He's very deep in his knowledge of government. ... He has a particular kind of appeal that's especially attractive to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at this moment.'' But <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he and Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundine </PERSON> are not ready to publicly back a candidate. He said of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, `` It was nice of him to come by.'' But he added that during their private meeting at the state Capitol, `` Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said nothing that I have n't heard him say before.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had tried to arrange a meeting with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> early last month in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> but could n't. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had asked to stop at the Capitol again Monday as part of a campaign trip through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in advance of the state's April 19 primary. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also campaigned in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Monday. `` Of course, I asked for his support and we talked about his desire to play the most constructive role possible in helping the country and helping the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> win a victory in November,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said they also discussed problems <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other states are wrestling with such as housing, the homeless and AIDS. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> rose to third place in the battle for nominating delegates by winning five Southern states in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the Democratic race between front-runners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has created a `` confused picture politically.'' `` We're _ <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundine </PERSON> and I _ now accelerating the process of trying to determine how best to be useful to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` Maybe we'll go beyond that and endorse somebody. We'll know within a couple of weeks.'' The fact that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has yet to endorse any Democratic candidate, coupled with his refusal to rule out accepting a draft for the nomination if there should be a deadlocked national convention, has kept alive the speculation that he might be angling for the nomination. Howver, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says he is not a candidate for president this year. Later <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, in a quick swing through <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, predicted he would do well in the state's Democratic presidential primary next Tuesday despite <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strong regional appeal here. `` I'm extremely optimistic that we're going to do very well here, in spite of the fact that it's in the backyard of one of my opponents,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said during a brief stop at an office building construction site outside of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. `` We're going to surprise some people here,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> expressed hope that <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> would make an endorsement soon, rather than remaining uncommitted until the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. `` I'd love to have the governor's endorsement and I've asked him for his support,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` But I certainly understand why he wants to take a close look at the race and think about it some more.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> praised <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> lavishly, calling him `` a tremendous leader'' who's done `` an outstanding job as governor.''

<HEAD>Reagan Refuses To Discuss North Pardon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused Monday to discuss a possible pardon for former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and a presidential spokesman said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer had not contacted the administration about the matter. In response to a reporter's question at the end of a ceremony to sign an Afghanistan Day proclamation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` Not going to discuss that now.'' Separately, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> repeated the administration's oft-stated position that `` there's been no discussions of pardons.'' He also said that the administration has not been contacted by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who has been saying publicly that testimony may be sought from the highest officials of government. `` The president will cooperate but we'll just have to wait and see what the format takes,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. North was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on charges he conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Earlier Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should pardon North. He said <PERSON> North </PERSON> had been guilty of misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but did not intend to break the law. `` I continually ask the question, where's the venality, where's the corruption, where's the criminal intent? <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` I do n't think anybody who watched <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> believes that he intended to break the law or that he intended to be a criminal.'' Asked if <PERSON> North </PERSON> had misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said, `` That's true. But keep in mind <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> saw his buddies get killed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He found the terrorists who had killed them through leaks. ... He was the fellow who helped plan the the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion.

<HEAD>Parole Examiners Recommend Release of Anti-Castro Militant, Lawyer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal parole officials recommended Tuesday that an anti-Castro militant convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign freighters should be released after serving a three-month prison sentence for violating parole, his lawyer said. The suggested sentence, which includes time <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> has spent in jail since returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The panel is expected to decide within three weeks. Parole examiners made the recommendation recommended after a closed hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, 61, convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign freighters and of firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a Polish freighter docked in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, served four years of a 10-year federal prison sentence. He has acknowledged violating his parole when he traveled to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1974. He served 11 years in Venezuelan jails until his acquittal on charges of bombing a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jetliner in which 73 died in 1976. But after serving his three-month sentence by May 16, <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> probably will be taken into custody by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Yoss </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has targeted <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> for possible deportation. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally last month after his release from a Venezuelan prison. Since mid-February, he has been detained at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>. Several prominent Cuban-Americans, including <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON>, head of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, testified before the parole examiners in a hearing closed to the public because it was an administrative procedure. <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON> said after the hearing that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> should be released because he had learned his lesson and now would work peacefully for the overthrow of Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` It is a crime to keep this man behind bars,'' <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s physician, said he testified that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> suffered from stomach, heart and prostate problems. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s illnesses would be aggravated by a prison sentence, he said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> in 1974, said he testified that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> could be released safely. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, the parole commission's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> regional administrator, said the decision would be forwarded to Regional Commissioner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rast </PERSON>, who will make a recommendation to the full, four-member parole commission in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two May Avoid Prison in Federal Civil Rights Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two men have been given a chance to avoid federal prison terms for their role in a racially motivated fight that resulted in the death of a Mexican-American farm worker five years ago. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON>, 35, who faced a maximum 15-year federal prison term, was sentenced Monday to 33 months in prison and assessed $ 4,450 in fines, costs and restitution. Federal Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> would not have to go to prison if he can pay the money by Sept. 1. <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> was found guilty in January of violating the civil rights of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozuna </PERSON>, 26, by beating him unconscious near <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, a town of about 650 residents 60 miles north of here. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> also sentenced <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 25, to 12 months in prison. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said he would suspend that sentence if <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> could pay $ 1,500 in fines and restitution by Sept. 1. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to conspiracy and testified for the government in the January trial. Both he and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said later they would raise the money for the fines and stay out of prison. A federal jury acquitted <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON>'s ex-girlfriend, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hires </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 29, of violating the civil rights of <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 17, by shooting him to death in the same fight. The 1983 case triggered controversy when <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> received a six-month jail sentence, a $ 15 fine and five years probation after pleading no contest to aggravated assault and battery, and <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was given 10 years probation for her no-contest plea to manslaughter. Outrage over what were considered to be light sentences in the state circuit court criminal case led to a federal investigation and the January trial on civil rights charges in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. According to the federal indictment and information from <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> pursued cousins <PERSON> Ozuna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> into the countryside. While <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> was beating up <PERSON> Ozuna </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> in the face with a rifle. `` I have been handing down sentences for 10 years, and I think without doubt this is the most difficult case I ever had in terms of meting out a sentence,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> told <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON>. But, the judge said, `` I am convinced that you will never do anything like this again.'' <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> had contended that drinking got him into fights, and the judge agreed, adding that only <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> knows whether he is really prejudiced against Mexican-Americans.

 Three children and their mother died Tuesday morning when the children set fire to their house while playing with matches, authorities said. The deaths follow a rash of similar fires here in recent months. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, who heads a program aimed at preventing children from starting fires, said 11 children have been killed in the last four months in fires they started. Fire Battalion Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwayer </PERSON> identified the victims of Tuesday's fire as <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, 36, and three of her children: <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, 1, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON>, 5. All were dead at the scene, officials said. A fourth child, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, 7, and a woman identified as a family friend, <PERSON> Dorleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 32, escaped the fire, <PERSON> Zwayer </PERSON> said. Police said the children were lighting matches and set fire to a couch. According to witnesses, Ms. <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> went outside, but returned to the house in an attempt to save her children. `` You -LRB- could -RRB- hear them crying and calling for their mom, and then their mom went into the house,'' said witness <PERSON> Lakisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasco </PERSON>, 12. On Sunday, four children ages 10 and younger were killed when fire struck their home. A fifth child survived and was in poor condition Tuesday in Children's Hospital. Fire officials said they believe that fire also was caused by a child playing with matches.

<TEXT>
 More Coast Guard installations would be forced to close next year if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to increase the agency's budget by $ 300 million, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday `` These are not intended as threats or scare stories; these are the real choices that we face,'' Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's proposed fiscal 1989 funding level of $ 2.98 billion would not enable the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to reopen any of the nearly 30 stations and offices closed in February because of a $ 103 million shortfall in the current budget. But <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said the administration's proposal would allow the remaining stations to stay open. In addition, it would restore to full levels drug patrols, which were reduced by 55 percent last month, and routine search and rescue patrols, which were eliminated. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a budget with only modest increases from 1988, the agency would have a $ 171 million shortfall next year that would trigger a more serious round of station closings, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't even come up with a list of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- facilities -RRB- that could be closed,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittee on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and navigation, embraced the administration's budget proposal as `` the minimum necessary for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to continue to function in the manner expected of it by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the American public. <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said while the 1989 budget request is a big jump from current spending levels, it really would just be bringing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> up to past levels. When adjusted for inflation, the budget request for the next fiscal year is about the same as the 1983 spending levels. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> since has increased its drug interdiction activities substantially. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> found that from 1980 to 1987, the proportion of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> operating expenses devoted to drug operations more than tripled _ from 7 percent to 22 percent. Meanwhile, the percentage devoted to more traditional Coast Guard duties, such as search and rescue patrols and marine safety, has been sliced from 60 percent to 51 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Last week, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> unveiled an administration plan to transer $ 60 million from other <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accounts to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to immediately upgrade patrol levels to last year's levels.

 Foreigners would be barred from working as crew members aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft and ships during strikes against the carriers, under legislation approved, 302-114, by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The restrictions would apply only to American-owned planes or ships that are entering or leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Supporters of the legislation said the measure would protect the rights of striking American workers by preventing companies from hiring foreigners to replace them. `` Aliens should not be allowed to hurt American employees by working in their jobs as strike-breakers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Roukema </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, the measure's sponsor. Opponents said the bill would hurt carriers by forcing them to release foreign employees in the event of a labor walkout, and would invite retaliation by other countries. `` It is easy to be against foreign nationals,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. The legislation was written in response to a 1986 strike against <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by its flight attendants in which the workers accused <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> of using foreigners to serve on trans-Atlantic flights.

 Newly issued guidelines for dealing with federal employees infected with the AIDS virus are in line with the general anti-discrimination recommendations of the government's health department `` We worked very closely with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managment </ORGANIZATION> in developing them,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The regulations are reasonable and reflect PHS concerns.'' <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, No. 2 official of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, heads the seven-agency <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> will review the guidelines Thursday with personnel officers from about 30 major federal agencies. `` The federal government, as an enlightened and compassionate employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees, has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of the AIDS epidemic,'' <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said in a memo accompanying the guidelines' initial distribution this week Quoting from <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> statements on AIDS in the workplace, the personnel office memo says, `` The kind of nonsexual person-to-person contact that generally occurs among workers and clients or consumers in the workplace does not pose a risk for transmission of AIDS.'' The guidelines instruct federal agencies to treat AIDS-infected employees `` in the same manner as employees who suffer from other serious illnesses'' and say there is `` no medical basis for employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency clients.' Fellow employes who disrupt agency functions by refusing to work with an AIDS-infected person could be subject to `` appropriate corrective or disciplinary action'' under the guidelines. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.

<HEAD>Free Market Flourishes Fleetingly In Brooklyn</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For a few fleeting weeks, free enterprise thrived in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. That was back in the good old days, about two months ago, when a thrifty commuter entering the <LOCATION> Greenpoint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> subway station in the morning could buy a $ 1 subway ride for 50 cents. The bargain was offered by three crafty entrepreneurs, who discovered the key to a padlocked gate next to a turnstile. They unlocked the gate, put the padlock on the turnstile and went into competition with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Transit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. From about 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. weekdays, the subway station was turned into a bargain basement, according to an account in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday. And then the police found out. `` AS OF 2-15 FARE FOR RIDER WILL BE 55 CENTS PER PERSON,'' read a flyer handed to riders shortly after the police crackdown. `` AND NO PENNIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED NO MORE. ... PEOPLE WE HAD RUN IN WITH TRANSIT POLICE SO THAT WHY WE RAISE IT. WE COULD N'T AFFORD OF GETTING BUSTED.'' The flyer ended on a promotional note: `` CATCH THAT FARE SPECIAL.'' `` It became amusing,'' observed Transit Police Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, still slightly astonished by this flowering of the entrepreneurial spirit. `` Because we arrested them, they increased the fare.'' The police had been notified by an irate token clerk, who arrived with a uniformed police officer each morning at 7 a.m. to find her competitors fully engaged in business. The token booth was staffed only at rush hour. The rest of the day, patrons without tokens had to go to the main station entrance two blocks away; those with tokens could go through the cage-like turnstile _ until the discounters arrived. At first, the men scattered when the token clerk arrived. But after a while, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, `` They were being so brazen that they would just retreat to the stairwell and wait for the uniformed cop to leave.'' Then they'd return to business, in full sight of the token clerk, whose business dwindled. About 100 riders a day were taking advantage of the reduced fare, plunking their money into a bucket beside the swinging gate. `` This really infuriated the railroad clerk,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Her complaints eventually led to undercover operations that resulted in the first arrests on Jan. 29. And the second arrests on Feb. 1. Each time, the men were issued desk appearance tickets and released. And each time, they went right back to work. On Feb. 16, the police raised the stakes against <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, 35, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 22. This time they went to jail on charges including disorderly conduct, petty larceny, criminal tampering and other crimes. So far, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who, like <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, lived in an apartment near the station, has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and served eight days in jail. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, who lived in a homeless shelter, has pleaded guilty to petty larceny and been sentenced to 70 hours of community service _ including washing subway stations. `` Even as we made the arrests, we had one guy in handcuffs and people were still walking up to him and trying to hand him money,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` They were pretty slick in their operation. They thought they had all ends covered.''

 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> opened a new round of Japanese trade negotiations on Tuesday with an appeal for fast resolution of the differences separating the two sides. The negotiations involve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other foreign construction companies to compete for an estimated $ 60 billion in public works projects planned in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over the next decade. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> announced that the American team would be headed by Deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who is taking over from <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Farren </PERSON>, a deputy commerce undersecretary who is leaving the department because he was passed over for promotion. `` I trust that everyone in this room shares my feeling that these negotiations on construction have gone on for too long already and that the time has come to bring them to a close,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said in opening remarks. Last week, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> set a two-week deadline for resolving the construction dispute. If the issue is not settled by the deadline, administration officials have indicated they will recommend that the president bring a trade complaint against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a process which could lead to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade retaliation against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Japanese have offered to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies access to seven public works projects. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have contended in the past that this offer was too small and omitted sophisticated engineering jobs. But <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>, in his remarks, indicated a willingness to consider the Japanese proposal as a starting point. `` The Japanese side has suggested that contracts worth $ 30 billion in seven major projects could be opened to bidding by our firms,'' he said. `` Very well, then, we simply ask that you open them, and that, over time, you add additional projects until the Japanese construction market is open.'' Verity called on the Japanese to open up `` the broadest spectrum of contract work'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bidding. `` Earthmoving and runway construction are not enough,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> charged Tuesday that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for tough trade legislation is just `` a political ploy'' that will end after the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses are over. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, said his position on trade has been consistent, and his staff released quotations from last year indicating his support for major provisions of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trade bill. `` Who is for a tough trade policy? Who is going to be for a tough trade policy after <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> asked in a telephone interview Tuesday. `` The answer is, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is and will be. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has n't been, is n't and wo n't be.'' `` When he is on the East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, he wants to talk about free trade. When he's in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, he does n't,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s tough trade legislation, now in a conference committee on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, has been the capstone of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman's platform. Monday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsed trade legislation sponsored by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, who in turn endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> quickly accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of having a `` battlefield conversion'' on trade, saying the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> bill was the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> legislation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are tied for the lead in the polls on Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a distant third. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say that may be the reason for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s attacks. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> stepped up the attack, questioning the sincerity of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for such legislation. `` I think he remains against it. I think it is a political ploy,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` By what he has done, he is trying to have it both ways. ... Now that he is in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and we are five days out from the caucuses, he wants to fool the people of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> late Monday that his position has n't changed `` He has been a strong opponent of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> bill from the begining, but has always been an advocate of leveling the -LRB- trade -RRB- playing field,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff on Tuesday pointed to quotes from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor last year in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. On July 11, 1987, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I think the trade bill which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved yesterday says if there is a consistent pattern of unfair trade practices ... there I think we have to do something.'' `` I feel a lot better about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill'' than the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> trade legislation, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on Aug. 4, 1987. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has said in the past you do n't need new legislation. ... He has been profoundly negative about everything I have said about trade.'' The congressman, too, provided quotes from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last year _ quotes he said back up his charge of a flip-flop. `` The president today has all the authority he needs to do something about those unfair trade practices. We do not need more laws or more amendments,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at the Aug. 8 debate at <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aides. In debates in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, `` You want a law. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, I want to act.'' And earlier this year in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aides said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` We do not need more legislation.'' The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amemdment and the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> bill do differ, but both try to strengthen potential retaliation against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners for unfair practices. In general, the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> bill would target specific industries in foreign countries which engage in unfair practices. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment would trigger retaliation against another country for running a big surplus with this country in part through unfair practices. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has always felt the president has had the authority to act. The <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> amendment ... gives the president a better way to get there, but he can pretty much get there on his own now,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of poor people are lining up for help at churches and soup kitchens as the country sinks deeper into political and economic crisis. `` It is a good thing people have such a good heart at times like this,'' <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said Monday as he cooked a big pot of rice over an open fire outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of town. The poor have been hit hardest by a campaign to oust strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that has crippled businesses, closed banks and dried up the supply of cash. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian government While a general strike paralyzed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Monday, scores of volunteers like <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> were working at soup kitchens run by <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION>, a Roman Catholic community organization. The Rev. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Verar </PERSON> said his parish at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is a made up `` mostly of people who are underemployed.'' They include `` women who wash and iron or work as maids and now can not find a job, construction workers who have not worked since the crisis started or laborers who work in whatever they can find,'' he said. Although food and money are scarce for almost everyone, help has been streaming in, the Rev. <PERSON> Laureano </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION>, said as he watched dozens of volunteers pick up bags of donated food. `` We have to help those who are worse off than we are,'' said a housewife who brought a sack of groceries. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> said <PERSON> Caritas </PERSON> believes more than 6,000 families in the archdiocese are without money or food. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, the owner of a small neighborhood grocery store, said he has been cooking broth for several days for the thousands of people who have lined up at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> soup kitchen. `` My wife and I are working here now every day,'' he said. `` No one is buying anything anyway, so I am not needed at the store.'' As <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> cooked, wiping the sweat off his forehead, <PERSON> Cirila </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> and her six children waited for a hot meal. `` I live alone but I have always managed to get food for my children washing clothes and ironing,'' she said. `` Now there are no jobs because no one has money. I have never been through a situation like this before.'' <PERSON> Verar </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> kitchen has been feeding chicken and rice and vitamins to the needy. `` We are cooking at least 300 pounds of rice every day,'' he said. `` We think we will have some beans and lentil soup tomorrow.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> also has a malnutrition clinic staffed by volunteer doctors and nurses. `` They starve to give food to their children,'' Dr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizarraga </PERSON> said, pointing to a woman he said had not eaten since Friday so she could feed her six children. `` My husband works in construction and he has not been paid,'' explained <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 26. `` I do not work and we are about to go out on the street and beg. It's all <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fault. We do n't even have bananas to eat.''

<HEAD>Council Votes To Make Hotel Guests Show ID</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARWICK, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The City Council has approved an ordinance requiring guests checking into the city's 11 hotels and motels to show identification. The measure was proposed in January following the discovery of the bodies of two women in different hotel rooms. The deaths, one attributed to strangulation and the other to drowning, were not related, authorities said. Mayor <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> was expected to sign the ordinance in a couple of days, said mayoral spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. It would go into effect 20 days later, she said. Councilman <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, the only one of the seven council members to vote against the ordinance Monday night, called the measure `` loose and vague'' and cautioned the council against `` stampeding to enact a bad bill.'' The ordinance was amended to say that information from a hotel registrant will be used only for emergencies or during criminal investigations. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> had complained that the original version violated the rights of individuals. The guest who pays for a hotel room would be required to show a driver's license, major credit card, state identification card, military identification card, passport, vehicle registration or vehicle title documents. Councilman <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wild </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who proposed the ordinance in January, said it would help police investigate cases such as those of the two women. Identification would not be required of people other than the person signing for the room. Neither woman had paid for the room where she was found dead. In the drowning, two people were charged with leaving the scene of a death, but no one has been arrested in the strangulation, police said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent here for emergency training exercises will stay on to complete the maneuvers, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said Tuesday, although <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> says its border crisis with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is over. `` Right now the plans are to make it a 10 - to 14-day exercises We have not received any directive as to when to begin redeployment,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> in a telephone interview. He said exercises were taking place Tuesday at four sites. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered 3,200 American troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week at the request of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, who had accused Sandinista soldiers from neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of penetrating Honduran territory in pursuit of U.S.-supported Contra rebels. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> denied his troops were in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Last week Honduran jets twice bombed Nicaraguan positions to force them to leave. No casualties were reported. Honduran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Tuesday the border tension `` has virtually disappeared'' after both the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras suspended hostilities and began truce talks. The three days of negotiations began Monday in the small southern Nicaraguan town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, near the Costa Rican border. The talks aim mainly at reaching a cease-fire so that both sides can strike a permanent peace accord in their 7-year-old war. The dispatch of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops bolstered the American military presence in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to about 6,000 servicemen. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration billed it as both a show of support for <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> and a warning to the Sandinistas against further actions in the border region. As the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> pulled out of the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region, where the incursion took place, <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said the additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would not be needed much longer. <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said, however, that the troops will complete their training first. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been carrying out joint exercises with the Honduran military periodically for five years as part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy of isolating the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Ten American soldiers were injured Monday when their UH-1 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> helicopter crashed during an exercise near the southern Honduran town of <LOCATION> Juticalpa </LOCATION>, apparently as a result of mechanical failure. <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON> said five or six of the injured soldiers would be released for light duty.

<HEAD>Documents Show Nixon White House Kept Heavy Pressure On Fed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> kept heavy pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> to do its bidding but gently turned aside complaints from one <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> critic, then-California Governor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, documents made public on Tuesday show. Among 400,000 pages of White House records released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> is a Sept. 17, 1973 letter from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> complaining about the impact of a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decision on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mortgage loans. The documents also included many internal <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> memoranda suggesting that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides devoted considerable effort to encourage <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, appointed by <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1970, to stimulate the economy prior to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 1972 re-election campaign. Critics claim the easy-money policy pursued by <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> in the early 1970s did keep the economy humming through 1972, but set the stage for sharply rising interest rates and inflation in the following year, triggering a recession. In his letter to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were drying up the availability of mortgage money in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They were doing this by easing restrictions that had kept interest rates which banks could pay on savings accounts below those offered by savings and loan associations, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The result, he wrote, `` has been a flow of funds from savings and loans to banks.'' Since savings and loans are the `` major supplier of funds for home building in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' the result of the action threatened `` irreparable damage'' to his state's home-building industry, Gov. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> charged. `` Present events have occurred which places the home-building industry in the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a potentially grave situation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> letter was shunted back and forth among several aides, with <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hullin </PERSON>, an assistant to domestic policy adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, recommending that it be given `` special attention.'' Although <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> assistant <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> wrote a draft of a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> response, the final job of answering <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was given to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s treasury secretary and now <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secretary of state. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told his future boss that while the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration `` shares your concern,'' a return to the former limitations on interests paid by banks would not solve the problem of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loans. `` We have been limited in our ability to maintain the availablity of home mortgage credit,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Then, he added: `` Inflation is our most important domestic problem and this administration firmly believes that the nation is best served in the longer term by our vigorous efforts to curb inflation.'' The documents released on Tuesday were a second installment of <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> material made public by the Archives. An earlier 730,000 papers from the White House Central Files Unit, containing many personal documents kept by <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and his top lieutenants, was made public in December 1986. The newly released documents seemed likely to fuel longstanding speculation by critics that <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> deliberately manipulated monetary policy to help re-elect <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> _ an allegation the late central bank chairman repeatedly denied. In any event, the documents show a pattern of close <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> involvement with the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on monetary issues during <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' tenure, including frequent meetings among <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and top White House officials. At one point, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> even arranged an `` appreciation'' luncheon for Burns in late 1971 to which 58 leaders from the financial community were invited. Although the first 20 minutes of the late <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman's speech to the group `` was somewhat professorial,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> at the end of his speech `` was very optimistic. From this point of view, the lunch was a success,'' former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> said in a confidential memo to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Noting that financial writers were then brought into the luncheon to speak to <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, the memo continued: `` While <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> is no -LRB- then <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON> in terms of stimulating a response, the exercise was clearly a plus.'' In an August 20, 1970 memo to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, his then chief economic adviser, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, praised <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> for `` effective leadership'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in easing monetary policy and proposed that the money supply be permitted to grow even more rapidly. `` We urge this in no sense of trying to ` take over' monetary policy, but merely as those who will be held accountable for the economy's performance during this period,'' <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` The relationship between administration officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> system has always been a somewhat uneasy one,'' <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> added. `` But it is the president who will be held politically accountable for the economic results of Federal Reserve Policy.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> himself wrote a confidential note to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on March 9, 1970, pointing out how the nation's money supply had grown since he had been named <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief five weeks earliers. `` Let me add that the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- board's liberalizing action took place only on February 10 _ the first meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> over which I presided,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The committee is the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s chief policy-making unit.

 A television evangelist who resigned as pastor of the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> church he started is the target of a police investigation and lawsuits claiming he owes tens of thousands of dollars. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON>, who came here from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> one year ago after facing financial difficulties in that state, said in a television interview Tuesday he resigned as pastor of Metrochurch Sunday to concentrate on paying his debts. `` I'm just having to knuckle down and go back to work and take my time and try to work myself back out of this debt,'' <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with station <ORGANIZATION> KOCO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> was interviewed from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where he said he is `` looking to put together a major opportunity which could mean I could maybe be out of debt very soon.'' <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> frequently appeared on `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> Weekdays'' on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> formerly run by defrocked minister <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>. He also occasionally hosted a show on <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> called `` Praise the Lord.'' Trinity discontinued using <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> as a host three weeks ago. `` The red lights went off when we learned his board has resigned,'' <ORGANIZATION> TBN </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Juggert </PERSON> said. Former <ORGANIZATION> Metrochurch </ORGANIZATION> members June and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Muehlberger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 16, 1987, against <ORGANIZATION> Metrochurch </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON>, alleging he repaid just $ 2,000 of a $ 126,000 they loaned him to buy pews. <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> police said Monday they are investigating allegations of embezzlement as a result of the Muehlbergers' complaint. `` We do n't know if it's a civil problem or a criminal problem,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabe </PERSON> said. `` It just popped up in the last two or three days.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> resigned from his church in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, where he was a well-known pastor and TV personality. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON>'s former <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> attorneys are seeking $ 18,426 they claim he owes for legal services. `` We've been trying to catch the guy for two years,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, attorney for the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> law firm of <LOCATION> Mosburg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kunzman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>, was quoted as saying.

 <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to make then-Interior Secretary <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> an emissary to protesting students after <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON>'s famous protest letter to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1970, according to newly released <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> documents. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, a long-time political aide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who was convicted of illegal lobbying last month, was working in the White House congressional relations office at the time. A memorandum from <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> to H.R. <PERSON> Haldemann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s chief of staff, turned up in the latest batch of <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> files opened by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on May 6, 1970, after the invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had set off a storm of protest on the nation's campuses. He said that attacks on the protesters by Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> were creating an impression of a lack of concern for `` the attitude of a great mass of Americans _ our young people.'' The letter, whose prompt appearance in newspapers dismayed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> should, among other things, talk with members of the Cabinet from time to time. <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> was quoted in news accounts as saying he had had only two personal meetings with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> since becoming secretary more than a year before. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s memo, dated May 8, 1970, said: `` Whether we like it or not, <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> is the kids' new hero. Suggest we use him. Suggest he meet with the president Saturday and then send him out to talk to the kids. `` Why not have the president meet with a group of kids tomorrow at mid-morning to take some of the steam out of the demonstration and give us some favorable publicity?'' The Nofziger memo was directed, apparently by <PERSON> Haldemann </PERSON>'s office, to <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s appointments secretary <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> seems to have sent it back to <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haldemann </PERSON>'s assistant, with the handwritten notation: `` <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> _ good idea? _ C''. After that appeared the one word, unattributed: `` No.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did meet with protesting students, on his own without staff preparation, at 5 a.m. at the Lincoln Memorial. That meeting garnered much publicity, most of it in a tone of astonishment. <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> defended each other in public appearances immediately after that, but <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> did not get to see <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and the president fired him on November 25 _ in a personal meeting. <PERSON> Hickel </PERSON> was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached, said his office in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had left for the day and also could not be reached, according to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Announces He Will Seek Second Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> ended months of speculation on Tuesday by announcing that he will seek a second term. Opinion polls have put the 71-year-old Socialist in the lead for the two-stage election, beginning April 24, although he was not formally in the race. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> appeared on the nationwide evening newscast of state-owned Antenne 2 television. When asked if he would run, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> paused dramatically, clearly relishing the moment, and answered with a single word: `` Oui.'' Yes. In reply to follow-up questions, the president said he decided to run because he thinks disunity threatened `` to tear the social fabric'' of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I saw a risk that the country might fall again into the quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often. I want <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to be united ... not be taken in hand by the spirit of intolerance, by parties who want everything, by clans, by cliques,'' he said. As soon as <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> declared, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, until now the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s only candidate, withdrew from the race and gave the president his full support. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s plans had been the subject of intense speculation. On some occassions he had indicated that he would preferred to retire and at other times hinted he would run because of a sense of duty. In the end, with four weeks remaining before voters go to the polls, duty called. The main conservative candidates, Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and former Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, had criticized <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> for being coy and cutting short the democratic debate. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> justified his silence by saying that with the premier campaigning it was up to the president to look after the nation's affairs in a non-partisan way The conservatives hope to end what the French call `` cohabitation,'' created when the conservatives ousted the Socialists from control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in March 1986, but were left with a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> president with two years to go in his term. The president is chief of state and has major duties in defense and foreign affairs. He appoints a prime minister who must be backed by a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The premier then names his Cabinet and runs the government. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said Tuesday that after watching the campaign, he feared opposing candidates were bringing on <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> disputes that threatened to damage the country. `` We need social peace,'' he said. `` Someone has to face up to this, and I shall do it.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> heads the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> the center-right Union for French Democracy. In a statement issued by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s campaign committee, the premier said: `` The stakes are now clear. There is on one side the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> which wants to retake power to lead a Socialist policy and its candidate casts aspersion on all the others.'' There was no immediate reaction from <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>. National polls consistently placed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> ahead of <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in a campaign that has been more a contest of styles than policies. A handful of minor-party contenders, including <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lejoinie </PERSON> of the once-powerful Communists, are expected to draw a combined total of 5 percent of the vote or less. <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> could get about 10 percent of the vote. A poll published in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper Sunday indicated 55 percent of the 1,813 people polled were satisfied with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Forty-eight percent were satisfied with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> as premier. Another recent poll, however, indicated 30 percent of those queried were undecided. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told the TV audience Tuesday night that he would pursue the programs and policies of the last seven years. `` I have maintained the confidence of the French people,'' he said. He suggested that if he won, he might dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and call for new parliamentary elections. The first round of the elections is to be held April 24 with a run-off between the top two candidates scheduled for May 8.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>, bidding to recover from the 1985 shutdown of its entire nuclear power system, won permission from the government on Tuesday to restart the <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2 reactor near <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The 5-0 vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> clears the way for the <LOCATION> Sequoyah </LOCATION> plant to become the first of five licensed <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> reactors to resume production of power. The approval was conditioned, however, on <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> resolving a last-minute problem involving temperature detectors in the plant's pressurizer system. The unanimous vote also provided a clear indication that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is not seriously concerned _ at least from a safety standpoint _ about allegations involving the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear chief, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. White. In a case referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators questioned <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s veracity when he certified in writing that another <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant, <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, met federal quality assurance standards. White has denied any wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said the commissioners had reviewed the case, still pending at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and `` we have concluded ... that there is no presently known regulatory reason to preclude authorization to restart'' <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2. `` There is nothing unusual about the commission's consideration of a restart while investigations are ongoing,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> added. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations that `` tremendous progress is being made in our nuclear recovery efforts ... led by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>.'' `` TVA is about ready to turn its nuclear corner,'' said <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to have a second Sequoyah reactor, Unit 1, ready for restart within six months. The Sequoyah facilities and three reactors at the <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry plant, near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, were closed in 1985 for safety improvements. After a management shakeup, construction of four other reactors was slowed down and plans for nine others were canceled. The <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> still was left with $ 15 billion in long-term debts for the nuclear program. <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry plants should be ready for restart sometime next year. `` We're not going to rush this process,'' said <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>. `` We're proceeding deliberately, and we're putting public safety above all else No one reactor will be restarted unless we are conpletely confident, and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is fully satisfied, that it can be operated safely and efficiently for a good, long time.''

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A blaze ignited in a kitchen and swept through more than 2,000 buildings in a northern <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> city, killing 113 people and leaving 20,000 homeless, government radio reported Tuesday. In a separate development, insurgents attacked a famous hilltop pagoda and killed five pilgrims and a government soldier, the state radio said Tuesday. The radio said the fire Sunday afternoon burned two primary schools as it engulfed 2,096 buildings within two hours in <LOCATION> Lashio </LOCATION>, a city of 200,000 in the northern Shan states. Efforts to communicate via telephone or telex with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> early Wednesday to obtain more details were unsuccessful. It is often difficult to get phone or telex connections to the country. The report said most of the victims were trapped by the fire, which began in the kitchen of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> resident, <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> <PERSON> Wai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>. In addition to the dead, 64 people suffered serious burns, the radio said. The casualty toll was the largest ever reported in a fire in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. More than 3,000 families lost their homes and damages were estimated at about $ 10 million, the radio said. <LOCATION> Lashio </LOCATION>, 450 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, is the largest city and business center in the northern Shan states and the seat of the northeast military command. In the pagoda attack, the radio said insurgents of the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attacked the <LOCATION> Kyaiktiyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION> in Mon state Monday with mortars, and then looted pagoda donation boxes and shops, robbed pilgrims and set fire to 13 shops and a fire station. It said 16 pilgrims and eight government soldiers were wounded before the rebels were driven off in a four-hour firefight. The pagoda, 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, attracts large numbers of pilgrims from all over the country, especially between December and March each year. The Karens are among several ethnic minorities in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> fighting the central government for greater autonomy.

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday conditionally authorized a restart of the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant near <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after a 27-month shutdown which triggered a management shakeup and hundreds of plant modifications. The commission, in a 5-0 vote, stipulated that one remaining equipment problem _ excessive vibration in emergency diesel generators _ must be resolved to the satisfaction of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s staff before the restart can begin Even if the generator problem is handled swiftly, <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seco </ORGANIZATION> still faces an uncertain future. Area voters are scheduled to decide on the day of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary, June 7, whether the 913-megawatt facility should be closed permanently. The reactor is the sole nuclear plant owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, but it represents about 55 percent of the utility's generating capacity and is directly responsible for 1,000 jobs and $ 75 million in wages. Indirectly, as many as 3,000 jobs and $ 150 million in wages are affected. The plant, which has long history of problems, was shut down in December 1985 because of a power loss in its control system, leading to severe overcooling of the reactor. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> subsequently required major overhauls of the equipment, as well as deep changes in management and operator training programs. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Andognini </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION>'s chief nuclear officer, and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a board member of the utility, told the commission the plant is ready for restart, except for the diesel problem, and pledged that safety would always remain the paramount concern in future operations. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said `` there's tremendous support for the plant, out there in the community.'' But <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON>, another board member, said he thought Rancho Seco should be closed permanently, even though `` I do believe it can be operated safely.'' <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON> said he thought the dangers were economic, arguing that the utility is too small to support an expensive nuclear plant with an uncertain potential for future production. `` Rancho Seco represents a $ 200 million per year risk,'' he said. `` We are not a large enough utility to support that kind of risk.'' One of the questions facing the voters is whether the plant should remain open provided it meets certain production goals. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> chided the <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> board for wording the issue that way, saying `` you should have emphasized safety on the ballot. It gives the commission some concern about the judgment of the board.''

 Almost a billion dollars must be allocated to the space station next year or <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will have to abandon plans to build the orbiting platform, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said Tuesday. A substantial cut in the space station budget, added to delays caused by cuts in earlier years, will make it useless for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to continue efforts to build the station, he said. `` This is year is crucial,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on science, technology and space. `` Otherwise, we've got to just forget it and start over at a later date. But senators attending the hearing warned <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> that would be extremely difficult to get <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> its entire requested budget in a year when federal dollars are tight because of deficit-cutting efforts. Seeral pressed him on how much of a reduction could be tolerated in the space station program, but <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the requested budget was the `` rock bottom'' that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said a severe cut in the station budget last year caused a full year's delay, and another cut in fiscal year 1989, which begins Oct. 1, would make it `` a waste of the taxpayers dollars'' to continue the underfunded program. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 budget calls for a total of $ 967.4 million for the space station. Plans call for the station to be assembled in orbit and for crews to start living in the orbiting laboratory in the middle of the next decade. The station funds are part of a $ 11.5 billion appropriation request by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> that would include money for space shuttle missions, advanced shuttle rockets, aeronautical research and a study of the technology that will be needed one day to send astronauts back to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and possibly to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The budget request, which was approved by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is a 24 pecent increase over <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s current spending blueprint. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said that unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes the entire space budget, there is no way for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to maintain world leadership in space. `` The entire future of the civil space program rides at risk on this budget,'' he said. `` This is a crucial year ... It will make or break the civil space program.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the budget is the final boost needed for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s recovery from the 1986 Challenger disaster, in which a space shuttle was destroyed and seven astronauts killed The shuttle fleet has been grounded since while the space agency corrected flawed equipment that caused the accident. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> tentatively plans to resume shuttle flights in August. Two are planned for this year, seven in 1989 and 10 in 1990. `` Without this increase, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will be in serious trouble,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. `` A major cut would be equivalent to the Challenger disaster itself.''

 A scholar abused research privileges at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> to steal and try to sell letters signed by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and other historic figures, a prosecutor said Tuesday. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> also defaced some letters between <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and Civil War generals to remove government markings that would have alerted a rare documents dealer to the fact they were stolen, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in his opening statement at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>'s trial. But Mount's attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON>, argued <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> had legally collected the documents and shoddy record-keeping led the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> to believe the letters were part of their collections. <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> said the government would offer no evidence showing Mount stole the documents, a point <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> conceded. Mount, 59, a Washington-based author of several artists' biographies, tearfully denied the allegations, but predicted he would be convicted Mount told reporters outside court that associates in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, had seen the documents when <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> during the 1960s. But <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> said a government freeze on his assets prevented him from bringing witnesses to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to testify on his behalf. `` Without witnesses, I'm going to be convicted,'' he said. Mount is charged with two counts of interstate transportation of stolen property and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine if convicted. His trial is expected to last three weeks. Mount was arrested in August when he tried to sell a 158-page collection of Civil War documents to <ORGANIZATION> Goodspeed </ORGANIZATION>'s Book Store for $ 64,600. A month earlier, the store paid <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> $ 20,000 for 23 letters signed by 19th-century painter <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> letter and one by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. The Whistler letters, brought to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in a plastic bag, were stolen from the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last July, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the jury. The Civil War collection disappeared from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> within a week before Mount's Aug. 5 letter to <PERSON> Goodspeed </PERSON>'s offering to sell the documents, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. Mount spent the last five days of July viewing the collection, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> asked the jury to note testimony about keeping records at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and how government records were stored before the archives opened in the 1930s. He said thousands of historic records were lost and stolen after the Civil War because they were kept in basements, attics, and even the White House garage. Records at the institutions show they should have possession of numerous documents that actually are in private collections, <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bowen Says Hospitals Engaging In `Medical Arms Race'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's top health officer said Tuesday that hospitals have engaged in a kind of medical arms race that assures neither quality care nor good value for the dollar. `` Sometimes you can save money and also improve care, like concentrating certain procedures in hospitals that specialize in them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` This not only leads to better results for the patient, it also allows us to benefit from economies of scale.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>'s remarks to a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> followed a report by the 28-member coalition that cautioned against emphasizing cost control to the point that the `` quality of care _ and quality of life _ are adversely affected.'' The health secretary acknowledged that the government is concerned about rising costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but said, `` We wo n't accomplish anything if we sacrifice quality for lower costs.'' `` One reason today's health care is so expensive is that the financing of that care is little more than a collection of disincentives to practice cost-effective medicine,'' he said. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> contended that `` hospitals, in order to attract doctors and their patients, have bought and often duplicated the latest in medical hardware in a kind of medical arms race.'' Another reason for concern, he said, is that government tax policies which do not tax employer-paid health insurance coverage like some other fringe benefits `` have encouraged employers and unions to bargain for ever-greater first-dollar coverage in health insurance plans.'' `` Compounding this folly,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> continued, `` most insurance plans cover expensive high-tech procedures and slight preventive services. And all of this has made patients and their families all but oblivious to costs, since they pay so little out of pocket.'' Turning to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, he said creation of the program 23 years ago `` created a powerful incentive for the health care industry to develop the technology to treat the chronic, degenerative diseases that afflict the aging.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he was not suggesting those procedures are bad. `` On the contrary,'' he said, `` They have improved the quality of life for Americans of all ages.'' `` Still to be decided is how much is too much. ... How much heroic medical care and how many procedures to keep a dying patient alive are desirable for the patient, the family and, not least of all, for society at large? When is such care merely prolonging the act of dying rather than contributing to longer life, or at least some type of quality to it?'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, a physician whose first wife died of cancer and whose mother recently died in a nursing home, said: `` Sometimes our high-tech capability lures us into pursuing expensive answers when less costly ones are available. Our veneration of technology has become a cultural blindspot that sometimes keeps us from pursuing practical solutions to our problems.'' The theme of the conference was `` Balancing Health Care Costs, Quality, and Access: The Challenge for the Next Administration.'' The alliance membership includes the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the Alzheimer's Disease and <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arthritis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the Aging.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will probably travel to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> within two weeks if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agrees to further discussions on his regional peace plan, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomat said Tuesday. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, the information minister at the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cabinet will vote to keep alive the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> peace initiative when the issue is debated. `` Apparently, Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will be in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> ... in two weeks time again,'' he told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not reject the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace proposals, <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> said, `` and if the government indeed decides a neutral way _ that means you continue negotiations _ then probably Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will go to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had not yet decided to return to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, where he conducted a diplomatic shuttle last month. Another State Department official, who spoke only on condition he not be named, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> probably would make his decision by the end of this week after being briefed by presidential envoy <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> about his tour of four <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> capitals. <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> this week, and is due back by Thursday following a stop in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> will bring with him reactions from the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan, which calls for <LOCATION> Israeli-Arab </LOCATION> talks to begin May 1 on Palestinian self-rule, and for the next phase to start by Dec. 1 to determine the future of the Israeli-occupied territories. So far, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the only party to have rejected the plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plans also may be shaped by his talks this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan, which envisions international sponsorship for the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations, the official said. A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were scheduled to discuss the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> on Wednesday, he said. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, addressing reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would be coming back to the region because the Israeli government will not reject his plan, despite internal divisions. `` They wo n't vote ` no.' They'll probably decide to continue negotiating about the plan,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, rejects the international auspices proposed by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> for the talks. His rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has accepted the plan. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an unusually blunt statement, warned <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> against rejecting the plan and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not change its proposals to suit <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s reservations. But <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> hinted at one possible avenue for continued negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan. `` There are some suggestions to cushion <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fears about an international conference,'' he said. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> was referring to proposed guarantees by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that an international conference would not have any power to impose solutions on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have suggested these guarantees would be included in a memorandum of understanding between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also might promise <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that the guarantees would be binding on future administrations. `` We really have the sense that if we can get this thing moving, that there really is no difficulty in having it move right across the boundaries of one administraiton to another,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Support for Super Collider Dwindles</HEAD>

 Congressional support for a $ 4.4 billion atom smasher is dwindling rapidly because of budget constraints and irritation with the site-selection process, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members said Tuesday. Although seven states remain in the running for the superconducting super collider, lawmakers say the huge project is in jeopardy. Some even advocate that it be scrapped at once. `` Now that all but seven states have been eliminated from the SSC site-selection process, the remaining states should help put an end to the process,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` It's time to face up to the facts. Testifying before the House Science, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said a financial commitment to the high-energy physics project would endanger funds for scientific research in other fields. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, whose home state did not seek the project, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recognized the conflict by appropriating $ 100 million for the collider in fiscal 1989 rather than the $ 363 million President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested. Congressional delegations from the states picked as finalists said Tuesday they are forming a task force to seek support for SSC funding. `` My fear is we will end up with a site to build the SSC and no funds for construction,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON>, R-Mich. Rep. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said that with the demand for budget cuts and the current feelings of lawmakers whose states were bypassed, `` it will be well-nigh impossible to pay for this thing. The collider would be a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets capable of whipping proton beams into each other with 20 times the force of the world's most powerful existing accelerator. Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions. The project is expected to bring thousands of construction jobs, permanent employment for as many as 3,000 people and an annual budget of $ 270 million to the host state. An independent panel appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> reviewed 35 bids from 25 states before picking seven finalists: <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said he would announce a tentative choice for the site in November and confirm the selection in January 1989. But the science committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, told DOE Undersecretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Selgado </PERSON> at the hearing that `` a question of credibility is arising'' about the selection process. He said said several lawmakers have complained that the department failed to use the criteria it had established previously when the seven finalists were chosen.

 Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told students at a campaign stop Tuesday that combating illegal drugs would take precedence in foreign policy if he is elected president. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told a crowded gathering at <ORGANIZATION> Traverse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> that he would use the military to stop the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said the nation's drug problem reflected `` a spiritual crisis ... an absence of hope.'' `` We have to have the courage to say there's nothing more important in our foreign policy than stopping'' illegal drugs, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told the students. `` I'll change that and put the war on drugs at the top of our foreign policy agenda.'' He commented while campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where polls show him trailing badly just four days before the state's Democratic presidential caucuses. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> canceled a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> in Madison to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to cast a vote to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a civil rights bill. He also stopped in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where he met with Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who is neutral in the presidential race, and received the endorsement of state legislative leaders. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he was `` a little bit'' surprised at Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to go along with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s civil rights veto. He added, `` When push comes to shove the vice president never disagrees with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. I do n't remember a time in eight years when he has been willing to express any disagreement with the president. `` He really has not carved out an identity of his own in this election,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, he called <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> `` an excellent opportunity for a <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> victory.'' In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, he said he expected to `` do significantly better than expected.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is running far behind in polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and he is competing in the state without campaigning intensively. His campaign has been airing radio commercials featuring an endorsement by singer <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, but has not aired television ads. He is running television commercials in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a state where he figures to have a greater opportunity to demonstrate broad appeal outside his native South. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is scheduled to speak to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisc. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Traverse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spoke to an overflow crowd of about 700 students at an event held after school had ended for the day. The auditorium was filled with hand-lettered posters, such as one saying, `` Al's your pal.'' With him was the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> backer, and the mayor of <LOCATION> Traverse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crough </PERSON>, who also endorsed him. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s comments on drugs were in response to questions from students. He pointed to the alleged involvement in massive drug smuggling by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He has repeatedly accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of having continued support for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> even after it had evidence of drug involvement.

 Early Senate ratification of the agreement banning medium-range nuclear weapons worldwide hit a potentially major roadblock Tuesday with the reopening of a long-festering constitutional feud between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the interpretation of treaties. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expressed dismay at the development. They said it could delay ratification of the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF Treaty until after the planned summit meeting later this spring between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. On another front, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reported unanimously that Soviet compliance with the new treaty can be monitored with `` great certainty.'' But the panel made clear that detecting Soviet efforts to cheat on a future pact making sharp cuts in long-range strategic arms would strain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence capabilites. The treaty interpretation controversy was raised in testimony before the Foreign Relations panel by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said a recent letter from White House Counsel <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> effectively undercut previous assurances from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that administration testimony on the new pact is `` authoritative.'' The dispute stems from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's unilateral re-interpretation last year of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in order to permit the deployment of a `` Star Wars'' missile defense system. The new <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> letter undercuts the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> assurance, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told the committee, by asserting that some administration responses may be less authoritative than others. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> suggested that the testimony of a secretary of state may be more authoritative than that of other administration witnesses or responses in writing to questions by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> has since issued a second letter asserting that his original remarks were not inconsistent with the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> statement. But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he finds that unacceptable. `` It does n't solve my problem,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` It simply asserts there is no conflict. You can assert anything ... It puts the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> statement in the trash can, saying that certain testimony is not to be taken seriously.'' He said the <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> assertion casts doubt on the authority of several administration interpretations on a list of ambiguities in treaty language. That might have to be resolved point by point in a time consuming process on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he believes the controversy must be resolved by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and that another letter, even one from the president, would not be acceptable. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said, `` This is the major stumbling block and could create grave perils if we do n't resolve it. He predicted that the issue could result in a serious partisan split inside the committee and in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would be tragic if this treaty was destroyed because we had a procedural dispute with the president,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash. The <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report was presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as that panel prepared to consider a series of amendments to the medium-range missile pact, the final phase of a two-month process of intense examination. The treaty was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 8. It eliminates nuclear-armed missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere and provides the most intrusive verification system in arms control history. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, D-R.I., the Foreign Relations chairman, said earlier he hoped the panel could complete its work by the end of the week, sending the treaty to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote expected sometime in April. Vote tallies in both parties predict ratification by far more than the required two-thirds or 67 votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> conducted its own review of treaty provisions, concentrating on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capability to monitor Soviet compliance with a variety of information-collecting techniques, including the use of spy satellites and on-site inspection. `` The intelligence community will be able to monitor the drawdown and elimination of declared Soviet missile launchers and associated equipment with great certainty,'' the panel said in its final report. But Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the Intelligence panel's chairman, said that effective verification of a future pact cutting strategic intercontinental arms by up to 50 percent would require a significant and expensive bolstering of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence The committee recommended `` investing more in programs that would be most helpful in verifying a START treaty, in preventing technological surprise and in supporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and operations in crises,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. Speaking for the committee, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said that because a Strategic Arms Reduction or START treaty would not involve a ban on an entire class of weapons but would rather impose limits on total numbers of weapons that will make `` the detection of cheating far more difficult.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said also that the extensive on-site inspection requirements of a strategic arms treaty _ with <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> inspectors given access to some of the most sensitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities _ could have a significant impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operations. It said that while it has overall confidence in the ability of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to detect Soviet cheating on the INF treaty, `` Soviet compliance with some of the treaty's provisions will be difficult to verify.'' The panel noted, for example, that a controversy between the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the Defense Intelligence Afency over the number of SS-20 missiles in the Soviet arsenal remains unresolved, with the <ORGANIZATION> DIA </ORGANIZATION> estimating a larger number. But it said the treaty's ban on flight testing will ultimately limit the utility of any covert SS-20 force.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should establish stronger ties with the rightest party that won convincing victories in municipal and legislative elections in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a congressman who monitored the weekend elections said Tuesday. Sunday's elections, which had a 70 percent voter turnout despite threats of violence by leftist guerrillas, proved that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> will be a major force in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. The party, known by its Spanish acronym <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, won a majority of the elections over the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> party of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. `` We really need to concentrate on working with the Arena political party,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> told reporters at a news briefing. `` We need to get more involved. We have invested there millions and millions of dollars in foreign aid. It's the only country that's had any democratic reform of significance over the last few years. It would be a shame to see the whole thing fall apart,'' he said. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> pointed to <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s strong electoral support across a wide cross-section of Salvadoran society and efforts by the party to moderate its views. And he noted the low profile taken by former army Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, the party's controversial founder who has been accused of links to Salvadoran death squads. `` My impression is that <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is not as nearly as right ... as we had originally suspected. There's tremendous support among the people,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` There are some bad apples, of course, within their party, but our information suggests that maybe they're not the crazies that you might suspect. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> was one of six <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who monitored the elections. `` Our observations concluded that it was a fair and open election,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jury Recommends Life Without Parole For Former Trooper</HEAD>

 A jury Tuesday recommended a former state trooper be sentenced to life in prison without parole for murdering his trooper girlfriend, the first woman state trooper in the nation slain while on duty. Circuit Judge <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> will not be bound by the jury's recommendation when he sentences <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, who was accused of killing <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> to collect $ 350,000 in life insurance No date for sentencing was set immediately. Ten members of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury voted for life imprisonment without parole, while two voted that <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> should die in the electric chair. The jury convicted <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> of capital murder Monday night after about three hours of deliberation. In a sentencing hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>'s daughter pleaded that his life be spared. `` He was _ he is _ the best father you could have,'' 14-year-old <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, 33, was convicted of shooting Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, 31, in the head at close range Oct. 11. Her body was found the next day behind the wheel of her patrol car, which was parked behind a rural church. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> described Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> as the first female state trooper in the nation slain while on duty. Prosecutors charged that <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> killed Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> for a $ 250,000 life insurance policy that paid an extra $ 100,000 if she died in the line of duty. The slaying occurred 10 days after the policy went into effect on the rookie trooper, with <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> as beneficiary. Defense attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said the trial's most decisive factor was evidence showing <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> gave investigators conflicting accounts before his arrest. Jurors saw a videotape that showed <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> denying he knew anything about Miss <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>'s death, and a second tape in which he told investigators he found the slain trooper's body shortly after she was killed. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he did n't tell anyone of finding her body for fear he would be accused of the crime.

 Forty wild Welsh ponies were shot dead and left to rot on this <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> island because the rancher who rents the island said he could not afford to capture and move them. The carcasses were discovered Saturday by a private pilot on a recreational flight, said Antelope State Park Superintendent <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON>, who had gone to the island Monday, concerned the animals may have died from disease. The uninhabited island was leased to rancher <PERSON> Dallen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> last fall, and <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> killed the horses to make way for sheep he plans to move from his home in <LOCATION> Almo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Weber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said Monday that the horses were over-grazing the island, and the cost of moving them was prohibitive. `` We looked at every avenue possible and economically I could n't do it,'' he said, explaining he would have had to hire a crew to round up the horses and rent a barge to move them He also said he could find no buyers for the animals. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said he shot the animals himself, but he refused to discuss details. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibb </PERSON>, an attorney for the owner of the island, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, said the horses were introduced about 30 years ago with commercial recreation in mind. However, the enterprise never got off the ground and the horses became wild. <PERSON> Dibb </PERSON> said his client removed about 100 horses by barge last year, but the others eluded capture. The shootings probably did not violate <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> law, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a special deputy for the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unless it can be proved the horses suffered or did n't pass out right away, it is legal,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> may have violated the law by not burying the horses within 48 hours, a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he planned to speak to <ORGANIZATION> Weber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richards </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether charges should be filed. The ponies appeared to have been dead for about two weeks, said <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Veterinarian <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> to the island Monday. `` There is no real danger from the carcasses other than maybe a bird pecking on them, then flying across to the mainland with that material,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't see any way to bury them. You would have to airlift a backhoe over there to do it.''

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s attorney general is preparing to ask the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to uphold a state law requiring professional fund-raisers for charities to tell potential donors how the money will be used. The nation's highest court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s petition to reverse lower-court rulings, which struck down the 1985 law as a violation of the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee. Both sides agree that the outcome of the case could have a nationwide impact on the professional fund-raising industry, which Attorney General <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> called a `` multi-multimillion-dollar business,'' and on smaller charities that lack personnel to raise money. `` It's really a question of survival,'' said <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Copilevitz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Optimist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, which filed a lawsuit in 1985 challenging the law. About 75 charities have filed a friend-of-the-court brief opposing the statute. Many are represented by Independent Sector, an umbrella group including such organizations as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Copilevitz </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> had filed briefs in support of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s law. The most controversial provision requires professional fund-raisers to tell people they solicit what portion of the money will be spent on the charitable cause and how much will be used to cover expenses. `` The purpose of the law is to promote honesty through disclosure ... in very much the same way that banks and other institutions are required to tell, for example, what their interest rate is going to be,'' <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said at a news conference. A study of fund-raising campaigns conducted in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> by professionals on behalf of charities between 1980 and 1984 showed that, on average, only 13 percent of gross receipts were returned to the charities, he said. The law presumes that whenever a professional group retains 35 percent or more of the gross receipts, it has reaped an excess profit, <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. The Solicitations Licensing Branch of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> is empowered to increase the charity's share if it finds excessive profit for the fund-raisers. If allowed to stand, the law would bolster public confidence in charities, <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. `` We feel that if a donor knows in advance what portion of the funds are going back to the charity, then they will much more freely give.'' But <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevlin </PERSON>, president of the Raleigh chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed. `` If the first thing you have to say is how much is going for expenses, most people ... are going to hang up before you've had a chance to go through the spiel,'' <PERSON> Shevlin </PERSON> said. The law might drive out of business many small - and medium-sized charities, he said <PERSON> Copilevitz </PERSON> said most potential donors who want information on how the money will be spent ask for it. Many states _ including <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ require professional and amateur fund-raising groups to provide such details on request, he said. Most states regulate fund solicitation, he said, but <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s law goes far beyond any other. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> struck down the measure as unconstitutional on May 14, 1986, a finding upheld by the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on April 23, 1987.

 Federal fuel-economy standards will cause thousands of traffic deaths next year by discouraging the use of safer, larger cars, two researchers said Tuesday as the government reported a slight increase in auto fuel efficiency last year. `` Fuel economy regulation inevitably leads to smaller, lighter cars that are inherently less safe than the cars that would be produced without a binding fuel-economy constraint,'' said a study by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. They estimated the standards would cause 2,200 to 3,900 traffic deaths next year. Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that passenger cars sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> got 28.2 miles per gallon last year overall, up 0.2 miles per gallon from the previous year. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said Americans tended to buy slightly heavier, higher performance cars last year than in prior years, and imports showed a shift way from subcompacts to compacts, increasing their market share by 8 percentage points. Among the Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had the most fuel efficient cars fleetwide in 1987, at 27.6 mpg, down from 27.8 mpg in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had a fuel-economy of 26.8 mpg, unchanged from the previous year, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s was 26.4 mpg, up from 26.2 mpg the previous year. Weighted by sales, imports had an fuel economy of 31 mpg, down from 31.7 mpg the previous year. Domestic cars averaged 26.7 mpg, up from 26.6 mpg the year before. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> used the report to reiterate his support for elimination of the fuel-economy requirement, saying it placed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition. `` The greatest contribution we can make to keeping jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to making the domestic auto industry competitive on a worldwide basis is to repeal the -LRB- fuel economy -RRB- rules,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Thousands of American jobs are threatened because of an anachronistic law that is doing substantial harm to our economy and our trade balance.'' The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards _ CAFE for short _ from 1978 sought to encourage more fuel efficient cars and thereby reduce petroleum use at a time of shortages and soaring prices. The required fuel economy this year is 26 mpg of gasoline. Manufacturers that fail to meet the standards are liable to fines. Using mathematical models, <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> estimated the CAFE standards had reduced the weight of cars by 500 pounds, to 3,100 pounds, despite sharp declines in oil prices after 1981 that in an unregulated market would be expected to encourage manufacture of larger cars. That decline in weight `` caused by CAFE is associated with a 14 to 27 percent increase in occupant fatality risk,'' the study said. They applied that range to existing traffic fatality figures to make their estimate of the number of additional deaths likely in 1989. The estimate took into account such factors as the tendency of occupants of smaller cars, compared with those of larger cars, to buckle their safety belts, the study said. The study also said the CAFE standards, by raising the cost of desirable high-performance cars, have encouraged people to drive their cars longer, extending `` the useful life of older, less safe and higher-pollution cars.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, D-Mich., said at a news conference marking the study's release he hopes the conclusions will help win support for legislation he introduced last year to abolish the CAFE standards `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not the place to design auto models,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said, acknowledging the bill's chances of passage this year are slim. The study by <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is scheduled for publication next year in The Journal of Law and Economics. The study was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Competitive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a public-issues group espousng free-market principles. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said they did the study without funds from the institute.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sued Tuesday to force the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to close its mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> envoy defiantly responded that he could live on the street as a refugee. The government sought a federal court order barring the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s observer mission; and five other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials or employees from continuing to operate the mission or any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> or at any other location. The action is required under the 1987 Anti-Terrorism Act, which found the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates were a terrorist organization responsible for numerous violent incidents, including the murder of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen during the hijacking of the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> in 1985. <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> said he would have no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s possible legal response until he reads the complaint. `` The only asset we have in this country is the building we live in,'' he told reporters. `` Maybe they want me to live on the street, but this would not be the first time the Palestinians become refugees.'' He called efforts to freeze <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> funds `` financial terrorism to strangle us.'' Earlier Tuesday, he had said, `` If they force me to leave, I will have to move to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>'' on international territory, out of reach of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. In 1973, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spent a night at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> because he could not stay on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs spokesman <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> said Tuesday before the suit was filed,: `` We will keep the office open until the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police seal it off. Then we will go to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and live there. `` This will become a continuous headache to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration,'' said <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel, was not available for comment, his office said Tuesday. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> did not immediately return messages left at the office. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has said, however, that he would seek to have the federal complaint dismissed on grounds that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts lack jurisdiction in the matter involving an international treaty, in this instance between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he would have to wait until the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> adopts a resolution Wednesday before commenting on possible legal action. The 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is to vote on a resolution supporting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s right to operate and deploring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moves to shut the mission. The draft of the resolution calls on the secretary-general to take measures to allow the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to carry out its official functions as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> invitee. In a separate action last September, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s information office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. That was before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed on Dec. 22. The law took effect Monday. Under the law, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> determined that `` the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its allies and to international law and should not benefit from operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Earlier this month, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called the act `` one of the dumber things that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has done lately.''

 A lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that an underground prison facility for women in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was designed specifically to house political activists and that inmates are subjected to inhumane treatment. Civil liberties groups filed the suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here against nine federal officials, including Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. It seeks the immediate transfer of the inmates from the high-security facility to the general population of a federal women's prison. The <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> opened in November 1986, now houses five inmates and contains 16 basement cells constructed beneath the federal prison at <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> said last October it will phase out the unit, the only high-security unit for women in the federal prison system. `` The primary purpose for the creation of the unit was to confine prisoners whose political associations and affiliations were determined to pose a security threat,'' said the suit, alleging violation of the women's constitutional rights. `` All the women in the unit are suffering psychological and physical harm as a direct consequence of their isolated confinement in this underground segregation unit.'' A new medium - and high-security facility for women will be opened in June in <LOCATION> Marianna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and the phaseout in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> will be completed shortly thereafter, said <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> She declined to comment on the suit. The `` small basement facility'' has `` virtually no natural light'' and is illuminated 24 hours a day by fluorescent lights, said the suit, prepared by the National Prison Project of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and other attorneys. The women, the suit said, are monitored continuously by staff and video cameras, have no opportunity to participate in any of the activities available to the general prison population and are subjected to random strip searches. `` We believe the women's lives are in danger,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Waysdorf </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for civil libertarians supporting the suit. `` They're beginning to experience signs of behavior modification, general disorientation, vision problems, loss of appetite, sleeplessnes.'' Among the inmates are <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON>, convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a $ 1.6 million Brink's armored car heist in <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that left a guard and two police officers dead Another inmate at <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled Brink's robbery <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON>, serving a 43-year term, was transferred to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> after refusing to be interviewed by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, the suit said. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, serving a 58-year term for possession of weapons and explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, was told that she would be confined to the unit until she changes her political beliefs, the suit alleges. When civil liberties groups began to expose <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> as a `` political prison, federal officials hurriedly brought in two other women serving long sentences,'' a coalition of prominent civil libertarians said in a statement about the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> unit. One of the women brought in later, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, serving a 27-year term for violating probation and escaping from a federal prison, was told that her release from the unit would depend on her lack of interaction with the political activists, the suit added.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> harshly criticized the process of gerrymandering on Tuesday, complaining that Republicans are getting short-shrift treatment in the redrawing of congressional boundary lines.. `` I promise you this: As far as the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned, he's not going to be sitting around his garden sniffing roses in 1988,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a group of Republican elected officials `` I'm going to be out on the campaign trail, telling the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the truth about how the electoral process has been twisted and distorted,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that reapportionment is scheduled in 1991, and said that `` having Republicans in state and local offices is the only hope we have of getting a fair deal. And that's what we're asking for - an end to the anti-democratic and un-American practice of gerrymandering congressional districts.'' Gerrymandering is the political process by which congressional district lines are redrawn in such a fashion as to benefit the party in power, whether Democratic or Republican. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said there were 367 congressional races contested by both major political parties in 1984. In these contests, the president said, Republicans won half a million votes more than Democrats, but the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> won 31 more seats. In his remarks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` gerrymandering has become a national scandal. The Democratic-controlled state legislatures have so rigged the electoral process that the will of the people can not be heard. They vote Republican but elect Democrats.'' The president maintained that `` the congressional map is a horror show of grotesque, contorted shapes. District lines jump back and forth over mountain ranges, cross large bodies of water, send out little tentacles to absorb special communities and ensure safe seats.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> has challenged Democratic gerrymandering in courts, `` ultimately, it's in the state legislatures that the battle for fairness must be won. And that's why Republicans are going to have to campaign with all our heart and soul for Republican state legislative candidates.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has steadfastly refused to take sides in the competition for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nomination to succeed him, but has indicated he will campaign actively for the nominee. In his talk Tuesday, the president signaled that he would hit the campaign trail for an array of other causes, including his plan to speak out against the practice of gerrymandering.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, said at the end of a second day of peace talks between Sandinista and Contra rebel negotiators that he expected a `` concrete agreement'' on Wednesday. He declined to elaborate, telling a news conference, `` Obviously we are n't able to go into details.'' Earlier Tuesday both sides said they had exchanged proposals, which agree on major points, for an extended cease-fire accompanied by amnesty and release of political prisoners. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> told reporters, `` We worked hard during the day. We clarified -LRB- points that coincide -RRB- and we are working on differences.'' `` It was a fruitful day and tomorrow could be even better.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> described the second round of talks as `` direct and frank.'' The two sides began three days of meetings Monday at this town on the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> border, trying to end a civil war that President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says has cost 26,500 lives since 1981. Both sides suspended battlefield action during the talks. The Sandinista delegation proposed a 30-day truce that could be extended to three months, during which the U.S.-supported Contras would lay down their weapons and join a `` national reconciliation dialogue.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, the deputy foreign minister, announced the proposal at a news conference. For every rebel who stops fighting, he said, the leftist government will free one of the 3,300 political prisoners it considers eligible for release. Most prisoners are former members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, as the army was called under the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, whom the Sandinista revolution overthrew in July 1979. Contrary to previous Sandinista demands, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said rebels who put down their arms would be free from prosecution without applying for amnesty and could take party in Nicaraguan political life. They would be permitted to operate uncensored newspapers, magazines and radio stations, but television would remain a government monopoly. Contra proposals, as outlined to reporters by spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, call for a 45-day truce beginning on Good Friday, April 1. Rebel fighters would move to cease-fire zones and a permanent truce would be negotiated by Sandinista and Contra leaders. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the Contras demand `` total and unconditional amnesty'' when the cease-fire begins, so anyone who had left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for political reasons could `` rejoin the political, economic and social process without any conditions.'' Contra leaders also want to join a national dialogue between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and their internal political opponents. An agreement signed Monday night by President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister's brother, and leaders of eight opposition political parties has a significant effect on that Contra demand. It says the parties pledge to discuss `` internal political issues exclusively with the government'' and the `` government will discuss exclusively with rebel groups'' all matters involving a cease-fire. According to <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, other Contra demands include immediate, total amnesty, freedom for all political prisoners and an end to mandatory military service. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said: `` At the moment at which a cease-fire is signed, whether it be for 30, 60 or 90 days, according to what the counterrevolution wants, at that moment the leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance -LRB- Contras -RRB- will be able to rejoin civic and political life and even participate in the national dialogue that seeks a reconciliation of all Nicaraguans.'' Both sides propose international monitoring of the cease-fire. The Sandinistas would have a 15-member international commission including representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, Contadora and its support group. Contadora is made up of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and began trying to negotiate peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> several years ago. The support group is <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The battlefield truce appeared on Tuesday to be holding. It was the first agreed suspension of fighting since truce for Christmas and New Year's during which some fighting was reported. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a former Sandinista who leads the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> delegation, called the exchange of proposals `` a step ahead.'' On Monday night, he told reporters: `` Neither side seeks a military victory over the other.'' Both cease-fire and reconciliation talks are required under the peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the five Central American presidents. It also calls for greater democracy in the region and an end to both foreign aid to insurgents and the use of one country's territory for attacks on another Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic primate, is attending the talks as one of two observers. He acted as mediator in four previous cease-fire conferences in which the sides did not meet face-to-face. They were held outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and ended without agreement. The other observer is <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soarez </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>.

 The battle for first place in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses will heat up the airwaves Thursday as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> goes on television with an ad featuring <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> counters with a radio ad featuring <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign is spending about $ 90,000 in the last 48 hours before the Saturday voting across the state, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> should encourage students to finish high school by denying driver's licenses to people under the age of 18 who drop out, the lieutenant governor said Tuesday. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a Democrat who plans to run against Republican Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in the Nov. 8 general election, held a series of news conferences across the state to introduce a package aimed at reducing the state's dropout rate. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is expected to win the Democratic nomination in the May 3 primary. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has no opposition. A similar bill failed during the 1987 legislative session, but <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said he was confident he could steer the measure through the Democrat-dominated <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had made no proposals to reduce the dropout rate although during his term nearly 100,000 youngsters _ one student in four _ have left school without a diploma. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s proposal was reasonable and interesting but said he did not know whether it would work. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said that if elected he would set a goal of halving the rate by 1992. The driver's license provision would give young people an incentive to remain in school, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Under the proposed law, dropouts would have to wait until their 18th birthday to get a license, while those still in school could take the license test at age 16. `` The state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> should do what a lot of parents do,'' he said. `` When their kids do n't study or do n't do well in school, they take away some privileges. Some parents take away their car keys.'' <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s package also includes hiring more guidance counselors and additional technical training.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION>, an influential weekly newspaper in <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, on Tuesday called for Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to visit Communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. It said in an editorial, `` In <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> there is not a single serious reason against a papal visit ... If there are reasons elsewhere against the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s trip, then these should be dealt with in a public discussion.'' If <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> should come to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, he probably would visit only <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, the two northern republics that are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, according to <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION>. At the annual meeting last week of the <ORGANIZATION> Slovenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-led organization, alliance Secretary-General <PERSON> Joze </PERSON> <PERSON> Smole </PERSON> said it was time to do `` everying possible'' to arrange a papal visit. <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION> noted allegations that Croatian authorities were opposed to a papal visit and said the decision could not be made by one republic alone. It is expected that if the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, he would honor the late Cardinal <PERSON> Aloisius </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepinac </PERSON>, who was convicted of collaborating with Nazi troops in World War II. The cardinal died under house arrest in his native village and his body was buried in the <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> cathedral. <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION> said there have been 11 visits to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in the past year by <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> state representatives, compared to one by a ranking <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader _ Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Djakovo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, in 1985 to mark a St. Method's anniversary. <PERSON> Smole </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> `` should at least honor the principle of reciprocity in its relations with the Holy See.'' Government officials have said a papal visit could take place when agreement is reached on all conditions. There was speculation that such a visit was discussed when Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> had a 30-minute audience with the pontiff on Jan. 30 <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION> said the clergy of the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and atheists probably `` would not gladly see the pope in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, but the opposition does not come from these quarters alone. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is so complex that a papal visit, unless it gained a kind of -LRB- national -RRB- consensus, would indeed become a motive for political showdowns.''

 Press conditions in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> improved after the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship fell, but a restrictive code and government intimidation still cause concern, the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. An <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> delegation said that after President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986, ending 29 years of harsh rule by the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family, radio stations and newspapers flourished. Local newspapers resumed political commentary. Bans were lifted on newspapers published abroad by exiles. Radio stations _ the main source of news in a country where illiteracy approaches 80 percent _ rehired staff members who had been deported or hounded into exile. `` When <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in February 1986, the media, like Haitians in general, assumed that they had democracy and acted accordingly,'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Barbados </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Haitian publishers, radio and TV station directors, opposition leaders and officials all agree that there was, in fact, almost total freedom,'' said <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON>, who traveled to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on March 17-18 and spoke with newly elected President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> and many others. The sense of journalistic freedom changed when the provisional government, a military-led junta, issued a press code in July 1986. It required journalists to have university degrees, declare news sources, and be accredited annually. Haitian reporters told the delegation the code raised concern. They also expressed concern about recent communiques from the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and armed forces cautioning the news media about publishing or broadcasting reports from abroad that might be perceived as negative to the image of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> or its leaders. `` Managers of newspapers, radio and television stations were almost unanimous that there is now self-censorship of certain news, and an awareness that to offend the army is to risk new repression,'' <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> supports the press code and `` brushed aside the delegation's arguments that the best press law would be no press law at all.'' In general, <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> said, `` the delegation was satisfied that conditions for the press in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> are much better than those under the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship, but also notes with concern the atmosphere of intimidation and mistrust, and the prospect of a new press law which will maintain some of the present limitations.'' Three delegation members stopped off in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> last week before going on the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The others besides <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> were <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrey </PERSON>, foreign editor of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> freedom of the press committee, and <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, editor of La Opinion in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 A prosecutor accused of fabricating death threats against herself during extradition proceedings for two Sikhs charged with terrorism gave <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents a description used to make a sketch of a suspect, a lawyer for the Sikhs said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> showed the sketch to several <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sikhs </ORGANIZATION> during an investigation of the threats against special Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, and one was ordered to appear before a federal grand jury, said lawyer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Sukhminder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Ranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> are accused of terrorism in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. A federal magistrate ruled in February that <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> could be extradited. The hearings were conducted amid tight security partly prompted by the threats to Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and an anonymous letter sent to the magistrate, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>. In a hearing before <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> on Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said there was evidence that Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> may have manufactured the threats. Laboratory tests found the same typewriter was used to address the envelopes and to fill out Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s application to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. The typewriter was found in her home along with three similar letters in envelopes, as well as materials apparently used to make the letters out of words cut from newspapers and magazines, the prosecutor said. Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office before the hearings began but handled the case as a special assistant, is in a private hospital. Her attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fettweis </PERSON>, has declined to comment. Federal authorities have said they would request a new extradition hearing to avoid the appearance of impropriety, and were considering how much of the proceedings should be repeated. <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said Tuesday he wanted all pretrial arguments repeated before a new magistrate and possibly outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. At Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said the allegations about Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> have no bearing on the case's final outcome. During the investigation into the threats, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said, one of his clients, <PERSON> Amarvir </PERSON> `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was ordered to appear before a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> grand jury investigating the threats. `` They did n't question him, they just viewed him'' to see if he matched the sketch, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Amarvir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was later told by investigators not to return for a lineup, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said. The lawyer said agents told Sikhs they interviewed that the sketch was based on Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s description of a man who shouted a threat at her in a shopping mall. First Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said he would not comment on the shouted threat because it was not on the public record. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mines </PERSON> said he would not comment on a continuing investigation. <PERSON> Jagjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangat </PERSON>, president of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents apologized to those who were questioned about the alleged threats. The allegations `` damaged the Sikh community quite a bit,'' <PERSON> Mangat </PERSON> said. `` Everybody is looking at us as a terrorist, but we are not.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials outside of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> are investigating the <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> case, and have the power to pursue an indictment, <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Federal Judge Dismisses Motion to Remove Case from Bankruptcy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge on Tuesday gave <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> two months to come up with $ 200,000, but rejected a motion to take the struggling school out of protection of Bankruptcy Court. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Trustee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McElreath </PERSON> had sought to dismiss the school's Chapter 11 reorganization petition. That would have left Bishop vulnerable to lawsuits from its 400 creditors, who are owed more than $ 12.5 million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, in denying <PERSON> McElreath </PERSON>'s motion, ordered the school to raise $ 50,000 every two weeks beginning April 5. If the school can not prove it has the cash on hand within three days of each deadline, he will reconsider the motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition. `` It's a good deal,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` It's incentive for the school, especially the students, to do something.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the school, which has failed to meet its payroll for two months, has operating expenses of $ 200,000 a month and would not have survived if the trustee's motion had been granted. `` Bishop is in a deeper and deeper financial hole,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Observers in the packed courtroom, mostly <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> students and faculty, applauded <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'s ruling. Afterward, many joined in singing the school's alma mater in the courthouse lobby. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, attorney for Bishop's largest creditor, its faculty-staff committee, praised the judge's ruling. `` Clearly the debtor is in violation on matters of legal concern, but law is about equity, too,'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said. `` The equity here is the human concerns of the students and faculty.'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> told the judge that 28 of the school's approximately 50 faculty and staff members had agreed to work without pay for the rest of the term if <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was allowed to stay open. Only two creditors joined <PERSON> McElreath </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 protection. Though he rejected the motion, the judge said <PERSON> McElreath </PERSON> was right to carry out his duty as court-appointed trustee to point out <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s violations of the bankruptcy filing. The most notable, the judge said, was the accrual of nearly $ 700,000 in new debt since the school filed for protection last May. School officials are hoping for aid from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to decide next week whether to renew $ 400,000 in funding for the school. That funding was lost last year when the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> failed to renew <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s academic accreditation because of its financial problems. Bishop's board of trustees voted earlier Tuesday to allow conversion of the school's bankruptcy filing from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 at the end of the spring semester in late May unless the school's dire financial situation changes. Under Chapter 7, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> would close and its assets would be sold to pay creditors. School officials are also working to get back $ 150,000 from two churches that recently withdrew donations. The churches backed out after <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugerman </PERSON> reneged on a $ 300,000 pledge. <PERSON> Sugerman </PERSON> had promised to match donations up to that amount. <PERSON> Sugerman </PERSON>, whose Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed in 1985 is still an open case, gave no reason for dropping the pledge and his <ORGANIZATION> Sugarman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is now under investigation by the state attorney general's office. <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, was founded as a college for blacks in 1861. It currently has about 300 students.

 Foreign Minister R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> apologized on behalf of the government Tuesday for a police search of the West German consul's home, but also criticized <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s policies. Police searched the home of <PERSON> Erhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s acting consul-general, on Monday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overrode President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a major civil rights bill Tuesday, ending a four-year battle to restore broad protection for women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped. A 73-24 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, followed by a 292-133 tally in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, handed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a severe political defeat and reversed a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that sharply restricted the reach of four anti-discrimination statutes. The votes in both chambers exceeded the two-thirds majority needed to enact a law over a presidential veto. It was the ninth time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had rejected a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. The White House pledged to enforce the new law, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had called a federal `` power grab.'' `` We presented an alternative civil rights act which stated the president's strong views against discrimination in this country,'' a White House statement said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chose to override the president's veto. We will work to implement the new law.'' `` People who voluntarily take federal funds have an obligation to treat everybody else fairly,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., summing up the rationale of lawmakers who have been pressing for the Civil Rights Restoration Act since the high court ruling The Moral Majority, which had campaigned against the bill, said after the vote that the legislation would cause `` severe damage to the free exercise of religion'' and `` will put at risk our other guaranteed freedoms.'' The court said only specific programs or activities receiving federal aid had to comply with four major civil rights laws. The restoration act bars discrimination by institutions, government agencies and some corporations that receive any federal aid. That means if a college physics department, for example, receives federal assistance, the entire college would fall under the civil rights laws. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his congressional allies argued for a less sweeping alternative, saying the act went far beyond simple restoration. They said it would curtail religious liberty and expand federal control over the private sector. `` It's a blank check to the bureaucrats and the litigators,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>. But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a statement that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto was `` wholly unnecessary and it provoked an unnecessary confrontation. The new law will not end illegal discrimination. But it does represent a step forward in making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> truly a land of equal opportunity for all.'' Supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> erupted into cheers and applause when the two-thirds mark was reached. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the mood was more subdued. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the bill, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had demonstrated that `` this country does not want to retreat on protections of rights for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. The opposition leader, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said: `` Sometimes you win some and sometimes you lose some. That's the nature of our process.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the 185-group <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, called the votes `` a bipartisan reaffirmation of civil rights and a bipartisan repudiation of the civil rights extremism of the Reagan-Bush administration. It was a great victory for civil rights and for the nation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the bill `` does little to protect these basic rights'' and may end up `` imposing unncessary regulatory burdens'' on businesses, farmers and others. Opponents contended the bill had little to do with civil rights and had much to do with what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday called `` a power grab by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, designed to take control away from states, localities, communities, parents and the private sector and give it to federal bureaucrats and judges.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had proposed an alternative last week that would enable more institutions to escape regulation on religious grounds and limit most corporate compliance requirements to specific plants or facilities receiving federal aid. As they voted Tuesday, many lawmakers, even some who voted to sustain <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, denounced a last-minute campaign against the restoration act by the conservative Moral Majority. They said they received hundreds of calls from people who said they had been told the bill would force them to hire homosexual ministers and teachers, give new privileges to drug addicts and intrude on their freedom to practice or contribute to their religions. `` Rarely has the legislative process been subjected to such a campaign of misinformation and distortion,'' said Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. Senate GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and acting <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> also criticized the campaign. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said he was concerned about erroneous claims that `` massive new rights'' would be created, while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in a statement that there were `` serious misconceptions about what this bill does.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nims </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Moral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement after the vote that the override is likely to be `` the major political issue for evangelicals in the 1988 elections.'' `` If enough people are not voted into office to change what's occurred, we will have entered the moral dark ages,'' <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who was absent for the initial vote, was on the campaign trail Tuesday for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination and did not vote then either. On a radio call-in show in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he would vote to override the veto if he were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he added, `` If it were the deciding vote, I would side with the president.'' Eight <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators who initially voted for the bill switched Tuesday and supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They were <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. In addition, two senators who did n't vote last time _ Sens. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> _ sided with the president. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling came in a challenge to federal regulation mounted by tiny <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In its attempts to reverse the decision, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> became enmeshed in controversies over abortion, religions and federal intrusion and was unable to pass a corrective measure until this year. The restoration act says entire institutions and government agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within them receives federal aid. Entire corporations are covered if they provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to the business as a whole, as in the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bailout. Farmers receiving crop subsidies, people using food stamps and other individuals receiving federal assistance would not be subject to regulation. An institution's refusal to perform or pay for abortions would not be considered discrimination against women. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision applied specifically to Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments barring sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. It was interpreted also to cover the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring racial discrimination in federally assisted programs; the 1973 Rehabilitation Act barring discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age Discrimination Act barring employment discrimination against older people.

 Democratic presidential contenders <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> broke off campaigning Tuesday long enough to return to their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> desks and vote to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a civil rights bill. Republican contender <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> stayed away and straddled the issue. With Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses looming as the next campaign test for the Democrats, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a `` battlefield conversion'' on trade issues so important to the automotive industry. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides retorted that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has long been in favor of trade legislation, just not <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s proposal. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, too, turning his anti-drug crusade into a slap at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policy. `` The No. 1 threat to your lives today is drugs,'' he told a high school audience in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>. `` We're not threatened by 3 million Sandinistas and if so, ca n't be saved from them by 15,000 Contras.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, did change his stance on one issue, agreeing Tuesday to support a ban on furloughs for first-degree murderers after public pressure stemming from the release of a murderer who raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. `` I try to listen, I try to learn,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who previously had called the furlough program for murderers essential for maintaining order in the state's prisons. Later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a trip to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to pick up endorsements from Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would do `` extremely well'' in next week's primary. Sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also would win the backing on Wednesday of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, whose name crops up consistently in speculation about a darkhorse emerging as the Democratic nominee in a deadlocked convention. That would leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> alone among the prominent non-candidates who has yet to make an endorsement. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll suggested a matchup between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the general election could be a close race. The network Tuesday night its nationwide poll of 1,007 people gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 48 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 47 percent. The margin of error was 3.5 percent, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the day, and the only other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopeful, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, was cutting his staff to avoid exceeding a federal spending limit. Aide <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON> said the payroll has been cut from a maximum of 230 to about 100, and another 30 or 40 aides may be released later in the month. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the civil rights bill and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' attempt to override dominated the political news during the day. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 75-24 to overturn the president's veto, more than the two-thirds majority needed. The House also voted to override, 292-133. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who is hoping to win the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on April 5, said he sponsored the legislation in 1984 when it was first introduced. `` This is something that ought to appeal to the basic good instincts of every member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. He said the issue involved is, `` Are we going to make real the dream of equality in the Constitution?'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, after collecting endorsements from several legislative leaders. He also met with Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, but came away without an endorsement. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> used the civil rights bill to attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the prohibitive front-runner for the Republican nomination. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who announced Monday that he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the measure, always sides with the president, `` even when the proposals are unfathomably dumb.'' `` When push comes to shove the vice president never disagrees with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he said, adding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't disagree with selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for hostages or in keeping <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll despite evidence of drug involvement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top campaign spokesman, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, dismissed suggestions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would begin looking for an issue to disagree with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on, just to prove his independence. `` The fact is, six months ago everybody was writing that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had to disagree with the president in order to get the nomination. Everyone now sees that that was a myth,'' the spokesman said. Far, far behind in the Republican presidential race, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he stayed in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> rather than return for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote because `` I was n't needed.'' He said he was personally opposed to the president's veto. But asked on a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> radio station call-in program, he said, `` But if it were the deciding vote, I would side with the president.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who was attacked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the campaign for not taking firm stands on issues such as arms control and tax increases, placed a formal statement in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> record that did not take a precise stand. In part it said, `` I have always supported legislation to overturn <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to restore the broad civil rights coverage that existed prior to that case. ... At the same time, I recognize that -LRB- the bill -RRB- is not a perfect bill. I am not fully satisfied with it ... But the fact remains that the administration and its congressional allies had the opportunity to offer amendments and they were voted down.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was absent when the bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> originally in January. The legislation stems from a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that says an organization receiving federal aid must follow anti-discrimination rules only for the program that receives the aid, and not for the entire organization or institution. The legislation would erase that distinction. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s repeated jabs at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> centered on the trade issue that is central to his own campaign. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman is the sponsor of legislation calling for retaliation against unfair trading practices. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> provision but declared a few days ago that he favors a different proposal backed by Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> _ the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> senator who bestowed his endorsement on Monday. `` We're getting some battlefield conversions,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is plotting an invasion of that Central American nation. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, meanwhile, rejected <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s call for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers to visit the <LOCATION> Honduran-Nicaraguan </LOCATION> border, where there was fighting last week between soldiers of the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Nicaraguan envoy <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Delia </PERSON> <PERSON> Casco </PERSON>, said of the alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot: `` The danger is not past. Indeed, it is growing. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plans to provide a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> incident to serve as a pretext for direct invasion and escalation of intimidation and threats.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent 3,200 soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week at the request of the Honduran president, who accused Nicaraguan soldiers of penetrating Honduran territory while chasing the rebels. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move was to show support of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and as a warning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Casco </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s department of international organizations, said the situation `` points to the possibility of imminent imperialist military action on a broad scale.'' The Gulf of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> incident occurred when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said North Vietnamese boats attacked two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyers in that waterway on Aug. 2, 1964. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Gulf of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> Resolution five days later and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began a military buildup in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that led to major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in the Vietnam War. A four-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team was leaving Tuesday night to inspect the Nicaraguan side of the border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> turned down a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> offer to send observers to that country. Honduran Ambassador <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> told the council a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team was not necessary because the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, in a regional peace plan signed last August, had set up an executive committee to verify compliance with the accord. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said Sandinista troops invaded <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and his nation had the right to self-defense. `` Our military response has been limited so far and the international assistance we are asking for basically has a deterrent nature,'' he said. Honduran jets raided Nicaraguan positions last week in the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region, which straddles the border between the two countries. No injuries were reported. On Sunday Honduran officials said the Nicaraguans were withdrawing and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would leave the country soon. Maj. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovatter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that the American troops were conducting training exercises that could last from 10 to 14 days. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the deputy permanent representative at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, told the council that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had launched a massive attack against the rebels, who have base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` The Sandinistas committed aggression against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It was not the other way around.'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> retreated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> without crushing the rebels because <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> reacted forcefully and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demonstrated its determination to help <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He said stability will return to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> only when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> complies with the regional peace plan and gives up `` its self-appointed right to subvert neighboring democracies and to launch premeditated attacks.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who said Tuesday he will seek re-election next month, has managed in one seven-year term to be both the least and most popular chief executive in the 30 years of the Fifth Republic. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, led the leftist surge in May 1981 that ousted President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing and the center-right alliance that had controlled the National Assembly for 23 years. The victory avenged Socialist <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s defeats in the presidential elections of 1965 by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> and 1974 by Giscard d'Estaing. After five years, French voters turned against the Socialists in the March 1986 parliamentary elections and returned control to the right _ creating what became known in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as `` cohabitation'' between a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> president and a conservative premier. Socialist policies had dragged <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s popularity rating in public opinion polls as low as 27 percent, but under the unwanted marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55 percent or more. The president pursued costly social programs after the Socialists gained power, but then reversed course, instituting austerity measures. Economic troubles brought his party to power, and caused its downfall five years later. After the Socialist defeat, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the day-to-day battles of governing, commenting on issues only occasionally. He was born Oct. 26, 1916, in <LOCATION> Jarnac </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and attended universities in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, earning degrees in law and letters. He was drafted into the army in 1938, and shot and captured during the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> invasion in May 1940. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> escaped from a prison camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and created a Resistance network. His long feud with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> began when <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> refused to unite his Resistance group with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>'s. It was in the Resistance days that he met <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouze </PERSON>, and they married in 1944, soon after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was liberated. He held several government posts, including interior and justice minister, during the chaotic postwar Fourth Republic. In the early 1970s he built the moribund <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into a major political force, but the Union of the Left he formed with the Communists fell apart in 1977. Not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main leftist parties join forces again to defeat <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> and oust the conservatives. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> shocked much of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> by bringing Communists into his government, but the union lasted only three years. In 1984, the Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

 Dissident stockholders dropped their opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s financial reorganization plan Tuesday as a federal judge opened a hearing on whether to implement the proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest oil company, announced that 96 percent of the shares voted, 174 million of 181 million, backed the plan, which would allow the company to emerge from bankruptcy court protection. After receiving the vote results, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON> heard comments on the plan, but no one opposed it. Later, he recessed the hearing until Wednesday morning. Even though the plan received more than the two-thirds vote needed from shareholders, the final decision on whether the plan was fair and equitable rested with <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON> confirms the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> could emerge from bankruptcy protection by mid-April, which would be a year after it sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was the biggest company ever to seek refuge in the bankruptcy courts. Shortly before the hearing, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the bankruptcy lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, announced that attorneys for dissident shareholders had dropped their opposition to the reorganization plan. Those stockholders had objected to provisions that would free officers and advisers of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> <PERSON> Trust </PERSON> and the J. Paul Getty Museum from all liability arising out of the court fight that resulted from a Texaco-Pennzoil battle over <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said it was forced into bankruptcy court by a requirement that it post a multibillion-dollar bond while appealing the $ 10.3 billion judgment held against it by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury had awarded the judgment in November 1985 after finding <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had interfered wrongly with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to acquire part of Getty Oil before <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> bought <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> itself. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept $ 3 billion in cash from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to drop the judgment. The settlement was the keystone of the overall bankruptcy reorganization plan, which would require <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to pay its other creditors an additional $ 2.5 billion. While some shareholders first opposed dropping liability for executives in the <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> matter, others were unhappy with anti-takeover provisions of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s charter and bylaws that they argued entrenched management and lessened accountability. The leader of the latter group was takeover specialist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who controls 14.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock, making him the company's largest shareholder. Despite his opposition to those provisions, however, he had said he would vote for the reorganization plan. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s involvement _ along with reported interest by fellow takeover artist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and others _ made <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> a prime target for takeover speculation in recent weeks. The company cleared another obstacle on Friday when it announced it had reached a framework for resolving a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it was pursuing claims totaling as much as $ 6.5 billion against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. But Friday <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said it would put into escrow $ 1 billion over the next four years while negotiating the dispute after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization.

 Demonstrators protesting against the state grand jury in the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case met counter-demonstrators for the first time on Tuesday, while at least two protesters scuffled with police. There were no arrests. Roughly 100 marchers led by the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family lawyer <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> gathered outside chanting, `` Governor <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, have n't you heard? This is not <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.'' That group was predominantly black. About 75 whites, who at first watched silently, began to shout back. `` Get Tawana to testify. We care too,'' some of them said. There was no scuffling between the two groups. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, a black 16-year-old, claims she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by at least six white men during four days in November. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and another attorney, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, have advised their client not to cooperate with investigators. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>'s group had promised to disrupt grand jury proceedings in the case. About 50 people from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> joined as many local residents Tuesday morning for a march from the <LOCATION> Mid-Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. Later, members of <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>'s group attempted to push through a line of police who stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the doors of a state armory, where the grand jury has been meeting. At least two protesters struggled with police and were taken into a van, but were released and allowed to return. `` If it comes necessary for arrests to be made, we'll make them,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said. `` I'd rather not.'' Despite temperatures which hovered near 30 degrees, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said his group would stay all night or even several days until the grand jury was disbanded. Some 15 to 20 protesters remained at the scene at midevening. A spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> would not say if the grand jury was meeting Tuesday, but there was no sign of grand jury activity. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> selected <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute the case. At one time, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had insisted that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> personally handle the case. They have since demanded a special prosecutor, but <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has refused. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> says <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> has violated the law by disclosing certain facts about the grand jury, such as the instructions it received, its purpose for forming and its makup. He said state law requires that grand jury proceedings be secret.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to shepherd its 40th convoy through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war zone and officers say alertness is as high as when the operation began eight months ago. They said, however, that a permanent high level of alertness takes a toll on the crew. `` The hardest part of the mission is that you have to stay ready 24 hours a day. There's no time, really, to let your guard down,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, 40, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, N.Y. He commands this missile frigate, one of 16 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships serving in the escort and patrol squadron called the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> spoke with members of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool Tuesday on the bridge of his ship, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest Perry-class frigates. Soon afterward, officers in the combat information center were monitoring radio traffic about an Iranian attack on a commercial vessel off <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, 90 miles away. Messages said the Greek-flagged tanker <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> G.L </PERSON>. was attacked at 2:45 p.m. approximately 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and was on fire. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a sister ship to the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, went to the tanker's aid from about nine miles away. The <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> rescued 14 crewmen in a lifeboat, according to Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. When the fire was under control, the tanker's skipper asked that the crew be returned to the ship, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. It was believed to be the third time a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship gave `` humanitarian assistance'' to a ship attacked by Iranian gunboats in the gulf. The last was Christmas Day when the USS <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON> rescued crewmen from a burning vessel in the southern gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has attacked seven neutral ships in the gulf since Friday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has raided a similar number of Iranian owned or chartered tankers beginning earlier in March. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. The Roberts, a 445-foot vessel launched two years ago, began its latest mission after a three-day resupply stop and the first liberty for the 209-man crew since arriving in the gulf nearly a month ago. Soon after entering international waters Tuesday, <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> ordered the crew to general quarters to `` clear the mind'' after the port call. They test-fired defensive gun systems as part of the effort to renew vigilance. On its last mission in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>, the $ 400 million warship had a series of `` close encounters'' with Iraqi aircraft, the captain said. From 30 to 40 Iraqi air missions came near his ship en route to attacks on Iranian vessels, <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said, including three Mirage F-1s armed with Exocet missiles that flew wing-to-wing 50 feet above the water. He said the jets came within five miles of the Roberts, heading away and not demonstrating hostile intent. `` You can basically say we were a blink of an eye away from anything that could happen,'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said. `` I'm never going to allow my ship to be shot at and hit,'' said <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, adding the fate of another sister ship, the USS Stark, `` is not lost on us.'' The Stark lost 37 of its crew when hit by an Iraqi Exocet missile last May 17.

<TEXT>
 A Protestant gunman who attacked a funeral for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas last week was charged Tuesday with murder in the killings of six Roman Catholics, including three who died in the cemetery onslaught. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, 33, was taken to court under heavy guard and police testimony said <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told officers his `` military operation'' was in retaliation for attacks by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Police quoted Stone as telling interrogators, `` I alone carried out this military operation as a retaliatory strike against <ORGANIZATION> Provisional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, in response to the slaughter of innocents at La Mon, <LOCATION> Darkley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION>,'' referring to some <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks in the last decade. He stood silently in the dock through the 10-minute hearing while a police officer also testified that <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told detectives: `` I would state I am a dedicated free-lance Loyalist -LRB- Protestant -RRB- paramilitary. No surrender.'' Stone was charged with killing three people March 16 at a funeral in <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> for three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members shot by British security forces in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. An alleged accomplice is being held by police. He has not been identified. Stone also is accused of killing three other Catholics shot in sniper attacks between November 1984 and May 1987. The victims were a milkman, a bread delivery man and a carpenter, none with known <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> links. An outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for each of those murders. In Catholic west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, where British authorities ordered a `` massive murder investigation'' after the killing of two British soldiers during another <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral on Saturday, police erected road blocks at main roads into the ghetto. British soldiers, rifles in hand, patrolled the streets. Police sources say up to 30 suspects have been identified from an army video and TV footage of Saturday's rampage. A funeral mob dragged the soldiers from their unmarked car, stripped and beat them. They were shot out of sight of the cameras in a soccer stadium. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> attacked <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two television networks, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, for refusing to give police their unscreened film of the horrifying scenes The networks said handing over the film would endanger the lives of their crews. `` Either one is on the side of justice in this matter or on the side of terrorism,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in the House of Commons as her rank-and-file supporters clamored for the government to seek a court order to force the networks to yield their film. Government sources said lawyers were considering legal moves. The two soldiers, whom the army has acknowledged should not have been in the area, were attacked after they drove up to the funeral cortege. Some of the tense crowd apparently suspected another Protestant assault following the gun and grenade attack at <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> Catholic cemetery. In <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION>, Stone, still hurling hand grenades and firing until his gun jammed, was captured by enraged mourners at the funeral and beaten before police arrived. The guerrilla attacks <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> cited in his statement to police dated back to Feb. 17, 1978, when bombers killed 11 people at a restaurant outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Darkley </LOCATION>, a village in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> near the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, gunmen fired on the congregation in a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> chapel on Nov. 20, 1983, killing eight people. In the <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> bombing on Oct. 12, 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blew up the hotel where Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was staying during a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference. She escaped injury, but five people were killed and 30 injured. At <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s County Fermanagh, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombed a service for war dead on November 8, killing 11 people. The victims were among at least 2,639 people killed in sectarian violence in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since 1969. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under a lefist administration. In <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, police said several people were held for questioning about the murder on Monday of a policeman at a checkpoint. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility. Earlier Tuesday, police sealed off the main shopping precinct in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> after discovering a 25-pound homemade bomb. Police detonated the device in a controlled explosion.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> left his rotting, frigid shack along the river in January for a new life with an elderly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> couple, but after three months he returned home Tuesday to start over again. `` I just was n't progressing,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said as he was greeted by a throng of reporters at a downtown bus station. `` They were looking for a more experienced man. `` I thought I'd get some wages,'' he added. `` They treated me very nice but no wages.'' The couple paid <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> room and board and deposited $ 300 for him in a <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION> bank about a month ago. On Monday, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> withdrew the money and boarded a bus for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said the money was put into an account after media reports appeared indicating he was n't receiving a regular salary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> hopped in a cab and headed for a girlfriend's apartment where he said he would be staying. `` I do n't have a job, not right off,'' he said. `` But I've got a few ideas of my own. I'm going to be looking.'' `` I'm sad that it turned out like it did because we really liked the man,'' <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said Tuesday by phone from her home in <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` He was very pleasant and friendly. We tried to treat him as good as we did our own family.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 34, also said he was homesick after working at the wrecking yard owned by Mrs. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, 68, and her 75-year-old husband, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>. He said he hoped to find a new job and planned to marry in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The Gilmans read about <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> story describing his life in a shack along the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> during subzero temperatures. The couple offered him a job and a place to stay. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> arrived Jan. 17 in <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION>, an eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> farming and ranching community of about 11,000 people. He lived in an 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer in the wrecking yard where he worked tearing apart old cars and rebuilding engines. On Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> blamed past news reports in part for why the couple's relationship with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> did n't last. She was angry that reports focused on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> being paid in room and board. She said people who read those stories had `` been calling us from everywhere saying we've been trying to make a slave out of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>. All we did was try to help him.'' Before leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he hoped his brother would help him find a place to stay. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>, 35, were arrested Jan. 18, 1987, on a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> tour boat and later pleaded guilty to burglary. They were sentenced to two years probation. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had been living on the boat at the time as shelter from the cold, said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, the brothers' probation officer. Ms. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said Tuesday that she was n't surprised he was returning. `` I felt there probably would n't be many people he could be friends with down there because there probably are n't many blacks in <LOCATION> Portales </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` I just felt he did n't think this through.''

 Thousands of Israelis mobbed Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on his return from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit Tuesday and cheered him for his firm opposition to an American peace plan. In the occupied lands, violence continued. The army said troops shot and killed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man in a clash Monday night, bringing the Arab death toll in 15 weeks of protests in the occupied territories to 107, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. The Israeli army has suffered one fatality. At least three more protesters were wounded in clashes, and a Palestinian who allegedly collaborated with Israeli authorities was shot and killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, Palestinian reports said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was taken to a hospital after being hit in the chest with a rock during a demonstration Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Balah </PERSON>, an army spokesman said. Returning from a week-long visit that included talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had set no deadlines for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept the plan. `` No one demanded anything from us,'' he told reporters at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> airport. `` It all depends on us.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also hinted <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was considering a return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in another attempt to defuse Israeli-Palestinian tensions. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, the information minister at the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will travel to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in two weeks to continue negotiating for acceptance of his regional peace plan. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had not yet decided to return. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet probably would vote to keep alive the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> peace initiative when it debates the issue in two weeks. Entering <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s car was mobbed by thousands of delighted supporters, who danced, sang and waved banners saying: `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> remains strong.'' `` These good wishes went with me wherever I went,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the crowd, mostly members of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and Jewish settlers. `` No one dared force on me decrees that lovers of the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could not accept.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> used harsh words to restate his objections to the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan. `` These proposals, in our opinion, will not bring peace closer, and the peace may even be harmed if -LRB- our -RRB- disagreements are not taken into consideration,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has repeatedly objected to a major component of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan _ an international forum that would launch peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors. He fears the forum would be hostile to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and force concessions from territories occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan also calls for three years of self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, with talks on an overall settlement to begin in December. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who heads the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and has supported the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan, toured the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Tuesday and discussed granting autonomy to its 650,000 mostly impoverished residents before implementing autonomy in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` It would be a scandal and a mistake to just get up and leave <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters. `` But if we could reach an arrangement of autonomy ... with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> which would enable us to live on terms of security with <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, I'm for that.'' The death toll rose as the body of a Palestinian was found in the hills of Tubas, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. An army spokesman confirmed troops shot the man Monday night when their patrol was attacked by protesters hurling rocks, metal bars and bottles. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the body of a Palestinian man was found in an orchard in the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The man's skull had been crushed. A military spokesman denied army involvement in the death, but villagers said the man was beaten to death by troops. A third Palestinian died when he was shot from a passing car in southern <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> by assailants assumed to be Arabs, the army said. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists said the man, <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafyeh </PERSON>, was killed for collaborating with authorities. Troops also shot and wounded a resident of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> refugee camp when he attacked an officer with a metal pole, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Officials at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> hospital said they admitted two Palestinians suffering injuries inflicted by troops. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, members of two <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> councils resigned Tuesday a day after an underground leaflet called for Israeli-appointed municipal officials to leave their jobs, the Arab-owned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In another development, a ministry spokesman said Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a parliamentary committee he authorized civilians to shoot at firebomb throwers if their lives were endangered and shooting was the only way out. State-run radio said earlier that Israelis were allowed to shoot if the assailant was not standing in a crowd.

<TEXT>
 It's hard to imagine a more miscast version of `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'' than the all-star revival currently ambushing audiences at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. Not since <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> curdled <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>'s `` Private Lives'' several seasons back has so much star power been used to so little effect. In this case, the big guns parading around in white and burgundy togas are <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON>. Each operates independently on stage, never connecting with the other performers or the play. A variety of acting styles are adrift in this endless, exhausting production that seems much longer than its two hours and 30 minutes. This is a `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'' that does n't connect on any level _ not as political drama, personal tragedy or even historical pageantry. Coming right after the Public's spirited and sensual `` Midsummer Night's Dream,'' it is a major disappointment. `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'' is a transition play, bridging the historical plays and the later great tragedies. The drama requires actors comfortable in both settings. There are none in this production, and director <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> is at a loss to impose any sort of style or unity to the diverse proceedings. <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Antony </PERSON>, gives the evening's most bewildering and idiosyncratic performance. The actor has a magnetic physical presence, and it's impossible not to watch him when he is on stage. His Antony moves like a feral, street-wise gang leader who belongs more in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> than in ancient <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. So does his accent. To compensate for his blue-collar patois, <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> speaks in a slow, deliberate cadence. He spits out each word carefully as if he were afraid of mispronunciation. What's left is language devoid of any feeling or emotion. <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, in the pivotal role of <PERSON> Brutus </PERSON>, has much the same problem with the play's poetry. He gives an unshaded, monotone performance. <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Brutus </PERSON> also lacks the patrician bearing that should be the hallmark of this play's most interesting character. He's a cipher and that blandness dilutes the tragedy. As a result, interest shifts to another of the conspirators, Cassius, played by the usually reliable <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>. A tall, vulture-like villain, the actor starts out strongly, insinuating his way into the good graces of <LOCATION> Brutus </LOCATION>. His explanation of why <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> should be killed is chillingly logical and effective. But once the deed is accomplished, <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> falters. His performance turns petulant, and <PERSON> Cassius </PERSON> becomes a scolding old maid furious that things have turned out wrong. <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> is also problematic. Although he captures the man's vanity, there's little here to suggest a charismatic leader. He's laconic rather than a commanding figure whose popularity threatens the empire. The supporting cast is equally unmemorable and all over the forum in acting ability and accents, although <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> has a nice moment or two as a comic cobbler. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s direction collapses in the second act. Awkward battlefield tableaux alternate with more intimate scenes that show the unraveling of the assassins' lives. It's a toss-up as to which scenes are more chaotic or unmoving. The deaths of <PERSON> Brutus </PERSON> and Cassius seem to come more as a relief than as the inexorable result of fate. The tragedy is nowhere to be found. The setting, designed by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, does n't help the drama. The playing area is all exposed brick _ as are the inevitable columns _ making the stage look like a <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> loft undergoing renovation. `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'' is the second production in the Public Theater's ambitious marathon to present all of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s 36 plays over a six-year period. Next up is `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacNicol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> as the star-crossed lovers. It begins performances April 19. Maybe it can get the Public's Shakespeare celebration back on track.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has offered to fly <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to exile as an inducement to get him to leave that troubled country, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. The offer came last week when two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoys met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and encouraged him to step down, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has refused to accept any arrangement that involves his departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, although the government of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has offered him asylum. The two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoys _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> _ told <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in their meeting that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to fly him into exile might be the `` last best offer'' he would receive for ending the crisis in a way that ensured his personal safety, one official said. The official said the offer would also allow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s family and friends to accompany him. Senior administration officials believe <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be forced from office shortly because of growing opposition to his rule in the Panamanian Defense Forces. The officials, speaking only on condition they not be named, said the anti-Noriega sentiment within the military has been accelerating over the past week and is probably the most important factor working against his survival as defense chief. They said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s efforts to overcome the crisis probably were not helped with his conditional offer Monday night to resign before the May 1989 presidential elections. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Panamanians regard the offer as a `` ploy to buy time,'' a view he said was shared by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The message from Panamanians is clear. For the good of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should leave,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, referring to the hostile reaction of Panamanian opposition leaders to the proposal and to the continued virtual shutdown of the country because of a general strike. `` His presence is the root cause of continued political and economic instability,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` The ongoing general strike is only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelming opposition from all segments of Panamanian society to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s continued rule. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, arriving on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Tuesday for talks on his campaign to aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, said `` We feel <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' when reporters asked him about the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said any proposal that calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation as defense chief but does not include his actual departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` is like getting the fox out of the hen house, then giving him quarters next door.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s plan would allow him to remain in control of the Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offer to resign, announced Monday night in a national broadcast by civilian chief of state <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, was conditioned on a dialogue with the opposition. Fissures in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> were evident last Wednesday when there was a coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Even though the plot was crushed, officials said, a number of officers knew about the conspiracy but said nothing, rather than tip off <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The coup attempt was the tip of the iceberg,'' one official said. Discontent within the military `` is what everybody was looking for,'' he said. And almost without warning, `` there it was.'' This development is more significant than the wave of strike activity in recent weeks and the country's acute cash shortage, reflected in the government's inability to meet the public payroll, according to the officials. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> were weakened on Monday when a series of promotions were announced. He said the promotions were based on `` political, not professional, reasons.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was said to have been defiant last Friday during a 3 -LCB- - hour meeting with two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoys who encouraged him to resolve the crisis by seeking political asylum in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or another third country <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told the envoys they had come under the influence of Panamanian `` oligarchs'' opposed to him and that the Americans `` were dumb enough to believe them,'' one official said. The two officials _ <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> _ appealed forcefully to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down but were rebuffed. They told <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that unless he resigns, the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> could fall into disrepute and suffer the same fate as the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. This was a reference to the military force which served under the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family dynasty and was dismantled by the Sandinista government after the 1979 revolution. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also was told that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is eager to see the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> survive and to continue its prescribed role as guardian of national sovereignty. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> reportedly encouraged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment on drug smuggling charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to accept an offer by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> under which he would be allowed to go to that country, provided he asks for asylum and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not seek his extradition the drug charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the legitimate government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is that of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to dismiss <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 25. But the Noriega-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted to oust <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was named new head of state. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents then called for a general strike in protest.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Tuesday it's absurd to blame <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for Nicaraguan conflicts and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has no military-political plans for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We are not reckless adventurers,'' the Soviet leader said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said his economic and social reforms have brought an `` upsurge of ideological clashes'' in his own country that are still going on. His remarks came as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> conferred in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on issues including the superpower dispute over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to stop military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, while <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> voiced `` serious concern'' about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs Nicasraguan rebels, known as Contras. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> accused the Soviets on Monday of furnishing an unceasing supply of weapons to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, outlined the Soviet position on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting Tuesday with <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying, `` We will never understand how <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> can threaten the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Western hemisphere in general; we will never accept the absurd claim that the ` hand of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>' is the cause of the conflict and an obstacle to resolving it.'' The Soviet leader said that `` the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> does not have any military-political plans in respect to that region and this theme has never even cropped up in our relations with the Nicaraguan leadership,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` Why should we need this?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` To provoke the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or somebody else in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? We are not reckless adventurers.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviets never supplied arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. He made no specific mention of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of arms deliveries to the Nicaraguans. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also referred in his conversation with <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> to domestic affairs, saying the economic and social reforms he introduced have brought ideological clashes.'' He said that those disputes `` have not yet subsided because people want to know fully why things that had come into being in extraordinary, extreme circumstances were retained also in normal conditions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not specify what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was referring to. He may have been talking about the drive by some Armenians to annex the predominantly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has been part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he expects the Shultz-Shevardnadze negotiations will help set the agenda for his fourth summit meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which both sides have said will take place in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in late spring or early summer. `` The talks ... will show if there is a real possibility to prepare a treaty on strategic -LRB- long-range nuclear -RRB- offensive arms in time for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, whether it will be possible to reach agreement on questions of the Afghan and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement and on other pressing issues,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was quoted as saying.

 The jury in the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> trial, deliberating the so-called `` preppie murder'' case for a sixth day, focused Tuesday on testimony regarding pinpoint hemorrhaging in <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s eyelids. The jurors, after being rebuffed in their request for medical testimony about the specific amount of time a person's neck must be squeezed in order for the person's eyelids to hemorrhage, widened the request to all testimony regarding the hemorrhaging. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> agreed to allow reading of testimony by prosecution witness Dr. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> city medical examiner, and defense witness Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornbluth </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> medical examiner. Near the end of the day, the jury asked for a repeat of specific parts of Ms. <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>'s testimony, and, as lawyers argued over the request, the jury was dismissed for the day. Earlier Tuesday, shortly after the jury began its sixth day of deliberation, the panel was called into the courtroom. A court reporter read this statement, which was agreed upon by the prosecutors and the defense: `` The amount of time needed to cause the pinpoint hemorrhaging in the lower eyelid was less than or equal to the time needed to cause her death. There was no testimony from the doctors who testified in this case that specified a specific minimum or maximum period of time that it took to cause the hemorrhages as opposed to the time it took to cause her death.'' Chambers, 21, is accused of second-degree murder in the 18-year-old woman's death on Aug. 26, 1986. The jury, which got the case Thursday, could also convict Chambers of the lesser crimes of first - or second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide The prosecution maintains he used her blouse to strangle her. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said in a statement to police that he killed her accidentally when she hurt him during a rough sexual encounter. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said the death occurred nearly instantaneously when he reached up and pulled Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> off him, flipping her to the ground. The kind of hemorrhage mentioned by the jury often results from strangulation. Medical experts who testified at the trial disagreed about how long the pressure had been maintained in Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s case

 <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, sought as a top man in the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, escaped arrest after a shootout early Tuesday between his heavily armed bodyguards and soldiers, the army's 4th Brigade said. It reported that at least one man, not identified but thought to be one of <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>'s personal guards, was injured. The army would not elaborate. At least 25 bodyguards were arrested after the clash and a variety of firearms and documents were seized, the army communique said. The haul also was said to include communications equipment, 13 vehicles and ammunition. The army said <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, and her sister were arrested elsewhere in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> carrying `` several documents of interest.'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> was indicted in 1986 on federal drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Another federal drug indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last month named <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and 14 others. In its communique, the army said that after <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> was located, patrols from the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, backed up by helicopters, surrounded the wanted man's luxurious country estate at 5:45 a.m. Tuesday. The estate is on <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s outskirts, 180 miles northwest of the capital, <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. But the army said troops tripped a sophisticated alarm system of lights and sirens, allowing <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> to escape in the shootout that ensued between soldiers and his bodyguards. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel is considered the main cocaine trafficking organization in the world. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have charged the cartel is responsible for up to 80 percent of all the cocaine that reaches the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in January ordered the arrest of <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and others named as cartel leaders for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the army said. Among those sought are <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. Troops immediately spread out in the small communities near the country residence, but <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> eluded detection, the army said.

 Legislators voted Tuesday to keep the presidential system of federal government rather than switch to the parliamentary structure with a prime minister. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> called the action `` an important victory.'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said the 344-212 vote by the lawmakers rewriting the constitution was `` better for the country. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> understood that.'' Later Tuesday, legislators approved a five-year term for presidents, rejecting by 305-223 a proposal to set the term at four years. The present presidential term is for six years, and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> was installed in office in 1985. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> had opposed a change to the parliamentary system, saying it would bring further economic and social chaos. Opponents argued that a parliamentary structure was an option for the nation that emerged in 1985 from 21 years of military rule. `` Presidentialism does n't exist and does n't work anywhere but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Affonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Arinos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Military, authoritarian and dictatorial regimes emerged mostly because of presidentialism in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' Leftist legislators opposed to <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> backed the presidential system. But they also demanded direct presidential elections this year with <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> stepping down in March 1989. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said he would leave office in 1990. `` We did n't want a queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, we want elections, direct elections this year,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoino </PERSON> of the leftist Workers' Party. The lawmakers have been meeting since February 1986 to rewrite the constitution. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, 57, was elected vice president in a 1985 electoral college election organized by the outgoing military regime. But President-elect <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON> died before inauguration in March 1985 and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> took power as the nation's first civilian president since a 1964 military coup. Brazilians have not voted directly for the presidency since 1960.

<HEAD>Judge Says Harvard Entitled To Possession Of Tennessee Williams
Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ruled Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was entitled to papers of the late playwright <PERSON> Tennessee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> after <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> attorneys promised that earnings from any publication would benefit his sister. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the author of plays including `` A Streetcar Named Desire'' and `` Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,'' died in 1983 at age 71. The hearing, one of the final steps in distribution of the Williams estate, came after <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> objected to a plan by <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, which holds the papers as executor of the estate, to give the manuscripts `` in trust'' to Harvard. The trustees for the 78-year-old sister, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, wanted the papers given `` in trust'' so the actual manuscripts could be sold if she needed additional money for medical and living expenses.

Oh, please, `` St. Elsewhere,'' come back! Tonight's two-hour premiere features difficult childbirths, artificial insemination and numerous gynecological exams. To start off, there's an emergency birth that requires forceps and incisions. Oh, honey, bring in the potato chips! <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulgrew </PERSON> plays hapless, overworked Dr. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, who founded the clinic with Dr. <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> of `` L.A.

In tonight's episode, he confides to another doctor that he and his wife have n't had sex in nine weeks. And the cobbler's children have no shoes. The show wants to offer up-to-date health information, like tonight's debate over mastectomy vs. lumpectomy in cases of breast cancer. Women's fears are unlikely to be assuaged by <PERSON> Gorshalk </PERSON>'s argument that patient <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhoite </PERSON> -RRB- should be encouraged to face the fact that she very well might die That should have'em flocking in for mammograms. Meanwhile, a couple who ca n't conceive are advised by the leering `` fertility specialist'' -LRB- <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> -RRB- to go for artificial insemination. After the procedure _ yes, we get to be there _ the nurse practitioner -LRB- <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> -RRB- gently suggests orgasm aids in successful implantation, and leaves the woman in a darkened examination room alone. In between trying to hit the sheets with <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> contends with a friend who's pursuing a career and ca n't be bothered with an `` incompetent cervix,'' meaning the baby will be born prematurely if she walks around too much. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> saves the day by borrowing a newborn from the nursery to convince the expectant mom she should stay in bed at least until the baby can be safely delivered after the next commercial. Meanwhile, Eve confronts <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s sexist family doctor, who thinks <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> ought to have a radical mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy. What good is a breast, anyway, says the doc? It's `` just a piece of fat. Huffs glamorous Eve in her spandex dress, `` So are some of your body parts. Would you like to chop them off and replace them with silly putty?'' Some bad taste seems unintentional. Dr. <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> -RRB- is in a crisis because her husband is off on a building job in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, causing her to remark, `` Sometimes I wish that whole construction project would get swallowed up in an earthquake.''

<TEXT>
 Is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> headed downhill, spending and taxing away its might and power? The thesis has arisen again, popularized by, among other events, an academic's best-selling book describing the rise to dominance and eventual deterioration of mighty nations through the ages. Several factors fit into the notion that assigns the latter role to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including budget imbalances, big defense budgets, trade difficulties, slow growth and onerous taxes. Hastening the demise, according to neat but perhaps not correct analyses, is the Kontradief Theory, named for a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> economist who many years ago claimed to have found a 50-year cycle of economic rise and fall. As viewed by the most gloomy of forecasters, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and much of the world's economy has entered a decline phase. The gloomy prospect seemed to fit a <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> scenario, judging at least by the covers of his books. He is, you might know, author of `` The Crash of'79,'' `` The Last Days of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and `` The Panic of'89.'' He laughed. No way, said the economist-author. While the country has troubles, he said, it is in the process of renewing itself, with lots of 30-year-olds with new ideas and energy now entering positions of power. `` Forget it,'' he said of the decline thesis. `` We've got the resources. We're dynamic. And we've got an infusion of the best of other countries through immigration.'' Why, he asked, should we listen to `` a dead Russian economist who made his observations before airplanes flew and before the development of service economies?'' But oddly, in the midst of one of the longest economic expansions ever, the notion of a dynamic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is sometimes lost, buried under concern for the worst aggregation of economic problems since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But dynamic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> exists in the concepts of many scholars, among them <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, who won a wide following for his research on small business while teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Small business, says <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, represents renewal. It has become the `` big picture in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Such businesses are innovating, exporting and creating jobs, he reminded a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of independent business people that had it origins during the 1930s. Turbulence in the business community often gains attention, with takeovers and demises and problems at well-known companies. But underlying the surface turbulence, <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> suggests, is a strata of economic stability and growth. `` We turn over about 8 to 10 percent of our corporations and about 8 to 10 percent of our jobs in this country every year,'' said <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, founder and president of <ORGANIZATION> Cognetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an economic research firm in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. It means, he continued, that `` we turn over half of the American economy every five years _ half of all the companies and half of all the jobs change every five years.'' New business, he pointed out, find niches, create products and eventually compete and force larger companies to innovate or die. After tracking about 12 million businesses for close to two decades, `` what we began to realize was that there was this huge changing of the guard taking place,'' he said. `` The dinosaurs were dropping like rocks, and a whole bunch of little manufacturing companies were taking their place,'' he added. The turbulence that accompanies the process is economic decay and a waning of power to some viewers. To others, it is seen as renewal.

 Argentines may have fallen out with the English over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, but the upper-crust still likes the way they talk. That is evident on the quaintly <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> campus of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quilmes </LOCATION> where Argentine children are still being sent to learn English with the proper accent and prepare to go on to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> For as much as $ 7,800 a year in tuition, the 330 boys and girls who attend the only British-style boarding school in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are assured as fine an education as if they lived in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said headmaster <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. Ninety instructors from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> teach children aged 3 through 18 the fundamentals as well as computer programming, chemistry, advanced mathematics and English literature. English at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s is the most common classroom language, although <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s Education Ministry requires that bilingual schools teach some courses in Spanish. The school operates on British discipline. `` We are very strict and that means the boys and girls are not allowed any physical contact in school. Holding hands is out,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We've all got to lead disciplined lives. If not we become pretty hopeless human beings.'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s is in <LOCATION> Quilmes </LOCATION>, a city of 100,000 people 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Once a popular residential area for the British who earlier this century built most of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s railways, it is most noted now for a brewery and the school Dotting the 62-acre campus are a chapel, rugby fields, gardens, two swimming pools, a horse-riding academy and dormitories where students are required to place their folded clothes and towels on racks in the bathrooms. The only inkling this is not <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is when schoolchildren break into Spanish after class or when <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s flag is raised each morning outside the administration building. `` It really is a little piece of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, the only American school in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` The student body is almost all Argentines from wealthy families who want their kids to speak English.'' <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> has 550 students, most of them children of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy personnel, diplomats and businessmen in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

The English-style and Argentine schools have their vacation from January to March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, founded in 1898, is considered one of the four top schools in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for learning English. `` We offer a 24-hour-a-day education experience,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoyle </PERSON>, director of studies at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s. Wakeup calls are at 6:30 a.m. and lights are out across campus by 10 p.m., which is the normal dining hour in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Student <PERSON> Magdalena </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, 15, hopes someday to become a diplomat. `` Most people here believe we're getting a very good education so we learn to put up with things that maybe we do n't always like,'' she said. Three other top British-style schools, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s and <LOCATION> Northlands </LOCATION>, are in the northern suburbs of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, but they do not offer boarding. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s is observing the 150th anniversary of its founding by Scottish settlers. With 1,900 students, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s is the largest of the British-tradition schools and oldest of the bilingual schools in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. One of its headmasters, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, was credited with introducing soccer to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> at the turn of the century. `` Without him there'd be no -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Maradona </PERSON>,'' said headmaster <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Prior </PERSON>, referring to the star of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s 1986 World Cup champions. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s has been coed since 1980. `` We have a particular ethos, particular spirit, something the parents of Argentine upper middle-class children choose,'' Prior said. Tuition is $ 1,600 to $ 2,400 a year. <ORGANIZATION> Northlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andrew </LOCATION>'s is considered the top girls school in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Headmistress </PERSON> <PERSON> Jehane </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> takes pains to separate her school from anything British. `` This is an Argentine school with no funds from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that happens to teach English,'' she said. Sensitivities over anything British comes from problems regarding the <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, off <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The Argentines have claimed them since 1833 and here they are called the Malvinas. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded the Falklands in April 1982 and were driven off by British forces three months later. `` During the Falklands these British-style schools got lots of phone treats, some of them obscene,'' said <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> of the American school. `` Some kids were pulled out by their parents and there were some classroom tiffs over the so-called imperialist British. `` So it's really kind of remarkable now that so many Argentines send their kids to these schools. I suppose it's kind of the snob thing to do.'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s School for girls, like <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, offers the international baccalaurete program for its 1,100 students. The program allows students to enter colleges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a second-year level or qualify for advanced study in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s coordinator, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Philpotts </PERSON>, described the school as `` British to a certain extent.'' Tuition ranges from $ 1,050 to $ 1,600 a year compared to $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 a year at <LOCATION> Nortlands </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Northlands </LOCATION>, said the tradition of Argentines sending their children to English-style schools goes back several generations. The school, founded by a British governess in 1920, gives 985 students `` an Anglo-Saxon point of view and a Latin point of view,'' giving students `` different ways of looking at knowledge,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ouster Of Baptist Liaison With Jews Opens Old Wound</HEAD>

 The ouster by <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> officials of a scholar for contending that God upholds his compact with Judaism opens an old wound in Christian-Jewish relations. It also pointed to a lingering, but increasingly repudiated, attitude in some church quarters. Historical church theories that God revoked his commitment to Jews, replacing it with a pact with Christianity, figured for centuries in anti-Jewish prejudice and persecution. However, many Protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> scholars have rejected that notion, as have some denominations. `` If God's covenant has been broken with the Jews, it's reasonable that other covenantal relationships might also be broken,'' says the Rev <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, who was removed from his post. `` Therefore, we in the church would be an endangered species.'' However, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> contends that God does n't go back on his promises, either to the mother religion, Judaism, or to the offspring of it, Christianity, and he cites <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION> 11: `` Remember, it is not you -LRB- Christians -RRB- that support the root, but the root that supports you ... and so all <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will be saved ... For the gifts and call of God are irrevocable.'' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was dismissed after 13 years of working with Jews as regional director of the interfaith witness department of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` My point is that the covenant with the Jews was not abrogated,'' he said in an interview, maintaining that they are saved through God's mercy, just as are Christians, but without accepting <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Christians, unlike Jews, needed <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> to draw them to the one, same God, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said. A letter notified him he was relieved from his assignment Jan. 31 because of his `` theological position relative to evangelizing the Jewish people'' _ something he opposed as unnecessary. It also offends Jews, implying their faith is useless. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>'s ouster `` strikes me like the Middle Ages,'' commented Rabbi <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klenicki </PERSON>, director of the interfaith department of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the mission board's president, the Rev. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>'s view was n't acceptable. The board lately came under fundamentalist sway, as have most of the 14.6-million-member denomination's agencies. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, `` The Bible teaches there is no other way to salvation except through a personal faith in Jesus Christ.'' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, with degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, linked his ouster to the heresy of Marcionism. `` That's what this thing borders on,'' he said. `` The Marcion heresy was that the God in Jewish Scripture -LRB- the Old Testament -RRB- is different than the God of the gospels -LRB- New Testament -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Marcion </PERSON>, a second-century preacher whose views were condemned by the church, rejected the Old Testament, which historic Christianity accepts along with the New Testament. `` I believe in Jesus Christ,'' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said, `` that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is God, but for me to believe that the God of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is not the God of Jews rooted in their Scripture is the heresy of two different gods.'' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said that after a tense meeting with officials last year, he wrote a letter at their request outlining his views, and his dismissal followed. In it, he said in part: `` The Scriptures provide a chronicle of how God has taken the initiative in concrete historical ways to save God's people ... `` In the Bible the term ` savior' properly is ascribed to God ... In the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gospel, God comes to the world in the person of a man, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> ... In the New Testament, the title ` savior' is applied sometimes to God and sometimes to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' emphasizing that he bears `` the authority of God.'' `` This established that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is the revelation of God who, as the Hebrew Scriptures teach, is the one and only ` savior' of the people of God To distinguish between the God revealed in the Hebrew Scriptures and the God revealed in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is, for Christians, a heresy ... `` God saves his people, the entire Bible asserts. This salvation is not brought brought about by the goodness of the people, but by the merciful initiative of God. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> provides the way for the nations to be engrafted into the people of God ... `` I find in the entire Christian Bible no hint that God cancels out lovingkindness freely dispensed or promised. In fact, we find the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. `` For this biblical reason ... I believe that the Jews of today, as ever, receive salvation through their having been chosen by God in covenant with <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> and the prophets. `` The election of the church is prefigured in this election of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and if the election of one is subjection to cancellation, so, too, is the election of the other.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Vice Versa''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 How do you figure it _ three movies in a row with the same basic plot? Last year it was <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> changing brains in `` Like Father, Like Son.'' Now we have Judge <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> pulling a switch with his young son, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, in `` Vice Versa.'' Soon to come: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> trading identities with his college-age grandson, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>, in `` 18 Again.'' Such coincidence is unfortunate, since all three movies possess the capacity to entertain. `` Vice Versa,'' in fact, is a nifty comedy of the supernatural variety. It benefits from a clever script by <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFrenais </PERSON> -LRB- who also produced -RRB-, lively direction by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and the inspired teaming of <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> and young <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> as the misplaced father and son. The role reversal is caused by a golden skull stolen from a Thai temple. In `` Like Father, Like Son,'' it was a laboratory potion; in `` 18 Again,'' an auto crash. <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> department store executive who is a less than adequate part-time parent. His 11-year-old son lives most of the time with his mother who is now remarried. During a brief visit, father and son touch the skull and become transformed. The fun begins, though both victims are distressed by their new identities. <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> is more interested in rock music and his pet frog, but he reports to the office and tries to fake his way through matters that are as foreign to him as trigonometry. Savage attends school, but he is bored by the childish doings and finishes his tests in a few minutes. He withers the school bullies and barks orders to his limo driver. He devises a radio transmitter so he can guide Reinhold through an all-important sales meeting with the store chief -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> -RRB-. Much of the hilarity is played off <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON>'s attempts to resist the advances of his sexy date, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohrer </PERSON>, and to explain his bizarre behavior to his secretary, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> -LRB- `` Beverly Hills Cop'' -RRB-, with his loony face and rubbery body, is perfect for this kind of tomfoolery. Matching him all the way is <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Princess Bride'' -RRB-, who draws big laughs by mouthing his adult dialogue. Director <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and the writer-producers have devised a genuinely sweet-natured movie, with only a few swear words by <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> to warrant the PG rating. From <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. Running time: 98 minutes.

 When <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> -LRB- `` A Hard Day's Night,'' `` Superman II'' -RRB- came out with `` Petulia'' in 1968, it quickly became a cult favorite with its quirky portrayal of life and love among the rich at the end of a turbulent decade. The critically acclaimed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> movie starring <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is among the videocassette releases for March from <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. Also highlighting the video debuts this month for home viewing: the <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda-Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards-Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> 1966 romantic comedy, `` Any Wednesday'' -LRB- $ 59.95, VHS @ Beta, no rating -RRB-, which has made the rounds on commercial TV sliced and diced; `` Innerspace,'' the 1987 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> sci-fi presentation starring <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>; the <LOCATION> Sally </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> comedy, `` Surrender'' -LRB- $ 89.95, VHS @ Beta, Rated PG -RRB-. Just in time for the Easter holiday are three movie classics with religious themes: 1959's `` The Nun's Story'' -LRB- $ 59.95, VHS @ Beta, no rating -RRB-, starring <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>; 1952's `` The Miracle of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fatima </LOCATION>'' -LRB- $ 59.95, VHS @ Beta, no rating -RRB-, starring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>; and 1979's `` Jesus'' -LRB- $ 59.95, VHS @ Beta, Rated G -RRB-, starring British stage actor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Deacon </PERSON> in the title role. A Spanish-dubbed VHS only version is available of `` Jesus'' for $ 59.95. Reviewed this week are `` Innerspace'' and `` Petulia.''

 `` Innerspace'' -LRB- $ 89.95, VHS @ Beta, Rated PG -RRB- `` Innerspace'' is last summer's fantasy adventure offering from the <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> factory. Its one claim to distinction is the spirited comic presence of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>. The movie, directed by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON>, takes off from the notion _ first explored in `` The Fantastic Voyage'' 20 years ago _ that a man can be `` miniaturized'' and injected into the bloodstream of another. In this case, the shrinking man is a daring but drunken test pilot played by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> and the unwitting recipient is a Walter Mitty-like supermarket clerk played by <PERSON> Short </PERSON>. The overly complicated plot involves rival scientists and enemy agents trying to steal the computer chips that make the `` miniaturization'' possible. Since <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>'s air supply is limited, Short _ aided by a newspaper reporter played by <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> _ must race the clock to retrieve one of the chips needed for `` re-enlargement.'' Some of the hijinks are clever, but the frenzied car chases grow tiresome. The special effects are good but occasionally graphic, especially one scene in which a villain is dissolved in a pit of gastric acid. Short makes a believable and likable character out of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Putter </PERSON>, who starts the movie on the brink of a nervous breakdown but ends up a self-assured hero. <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> have less to work with, and several other capable actors are more or less wasted in minor parts, including <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` Innerspace'' is harmless enough for helping kids 8 and over while away a rainy afternoon. Adults, however, may grow weary before the caper has run its course. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Petulia'' -LRB- $ 59.95, VHS @ Beta, Rated R -RRB- What is Dr. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollen </PERSON> doing in a high-tech motel with the rich, lovely and utterly weird <PERSON> Petulia </PERSON>? Darned if he knows. `` We're about to become lovers,'' she informs him as he tries to unhook the feathery jacket to her sparkling gown. They do n't. Not then, anyway. The scene in the first 30 minutes of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>'s `` Petulia'' introduces us to the title character played by <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> who has just picked up the recently divorced <PERSON> Bollen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> -RRB- at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> charity ball while her husband -LRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> -RRB- looks on <PERSON> Bollen </PERSON> declares <PERSON> Petulia </PERSON> a `` kook,'' but she haunts him in more ways than one, ultimately showing up at his apartment with a stolen tuba and broken ribs and crawling into his life. But even <PERSON> Bollen </PERSON>'s love ca n't save Petulia from herself and a violent marriage Using flashbacks and flashforwards, <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> and cinematographer <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeg </PERSON>, present a stark, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening portrait of love among the spoiled rich during the turbulent end of the 1960s. On the small, home screen in the 1980s, the movie holds up just fine with some richly textured images and closeups that show a beautiful <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, a young <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> as remembered from TV's `` Dr. <PERSON> Kildare </PERSON>'' days and a somewhat sexy <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. There are also a few cameo surprises, such as <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> with Big Brother and the Holding Company entertaining at the benefit. Music by the Grateful Dead also permeates the flick. `` Petulia,'' with its love triangle and battered wife themes easily plays today, and like `` The Graduate'' gives a savage portrait of a time not forgotten. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Widdoes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pippa </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> fill out the cast. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Savage'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ Eurythmics On `` <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Eurythmics </ORGANIZATION> are misanthropic, caustic and a bit paranoid. They're strong on attitude but weak on delivery. The record emphasizes a big beat, mostly via programmed drums and bass lines that make for mechanical music. Worst is the opening cut, `` Beethoven -LRB- I Love to Listen to -RRB-.'' Add singer <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON>'s dry delivery, and the resulting sounds have both the pulse and personality of a locomotive Lost in the thundering shuffle are the lyrics by <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, which positively snarl on paper. <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> spends much of the record telling us that love is cheap and men merit no respect. `` Love is a temple, love is a shrine, buy some love at the five and dime,'' she sings on the best song, `` You Have Placed a Chill In My Heart.'' Oddly, <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> ease up on the syncopation on the last two cuts of the record, which closes with the upbeat `` Brand New Day.'' After 11 songs filled with cynicism, it's hard to believe the optimistic message is sincere. But maybe it presages more subtlety and finesse on their next record.

 `` Live _ The Road'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The Kinks It's bad news when the best thing on an album titled `` Live _ The Road'' is a studio cut. But that's the case with the Kinks' latest record It opens with a new composition, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>' engaging, autobiographical `` The <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>.'' `` There's gas in my tank, and I've still got a ways to go,'' the veteran rocker sings On the rest of the album, recorded in concert last summer, the Kinks play with the verve of a driver intent on getting good mileage. There are stirring moments in the 50 minutes of music: `` Come Dancing,'' sparked by <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>' fluid guitar work; the provocative `` Art Lover,'' which only <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> could have written; and the rocking `` Destroyer'' and `` Around the Dial.'' But `` It,'' the album's other new song, and `` Cliches of the World'' are too long and too ambitious. The other performances are routine, with riffs and tempos that belong in a heavy metal cutout bin. `` Live _ The Road'' is not a bad set, and the Kinks deserve credit for reprising some of their lesser-known material from the 1980s -LRB- at one point they tease the audience with a false start of `` Lola'' -RRB-. But from such a well-respected band, it's a disappointment.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> paced the darkened backstage of the Caesars Palace showroom, hummed softly and flicked ashes from his ever-present cigar. `` I'm just making sure I can still walk,'' he dead-panned to a couple sitting in the wings. Moments later, as the orchestra struck up `` Ai n't Misbehavin','' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> sauntered on stage to a standing ovation, a rarity for the opening of a Las Vegas show. He would receive two more before exiting an hour later _ a sign of the respect audiences hold for this man who was a vaudeville star in their grandparents' time. At 92, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> shows no signs of slowing down. He's a regular at the Palace on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and at other Caesars properties in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> His pace would satisfy, and slow, most performers half his age. However, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> has just completed a new movie, `` 18 Again,'' which opens April 9. And he's working on a new book about the one true love of his life, <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, his stage partner, confidante, best friend and wife for 38 years until her death in 1964. The book, `` Gracie: A Love Story,'' is due out in October. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' longtime friend and manager for 14 years, says the book will be `` a loving, warm story about <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> that has never before been told. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> will always have this special love for <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said during <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' recent appearance here. `` He goes to her grave -LRB- in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> -RRB- once a month. He talks to her, tells her everything he's doing. He'll say ` I just got back from <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. We did great.' Or ` I just finished a movie. It's about me and my grandson and how we switch places.' `` He'll spend a lot of time just standing there talking to her, letting her know what's happening in his life. She's still a very special part of his life.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> gives his long-time mate the credit for his success. `` If it was n't for <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>, I would n't be here,'' he said, puffing on a cigar in his dressing room before a recent Caesars show. He crossed the room to a bar, poured a cup of coffee, then settled in a chair next to the piano. <PERSON> Morty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, his pianist of 18 years, began picking out tunes <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> sang as a teen-ager three-quarters of a century ago. `` What key is that?'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> inquired of <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. `` Take it half a tone lower.'' `` We'll do some lovin', then you'll ask for more,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> sang, tapping shiny patent leather shoes on the dressing room floor. Onstage, opening act <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> was belting out a raucous version of `` Old Time Rock and Roll,'' a signal for <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> to exit his dressing room. He walked briskly back and forth in the darkened area, stopping to talk to workers or softly humming some of the songs he would sing. Miss <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> dedicated her final song, `` Forever Young,'' to <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. He took a long drag on his cigar, then entered to the standing ovation. `` In 1981 I played God,'' he said, referring to the first of three movies in which he played the deity. `` I was a nervous wreck. We're both the same age, but we grew up in different neighborhoods. `` Why should n't I play God? Anything I do at my age is a miracle. `` I've written six books. That's pretty good for a guy who only read two.'' His formula for acting? `` If the director wants me to cry, I think of my sex life. `` If the director wants me to laugh, I think of my sex life.'' About that sex life? `` I'd go out with women my age, but there are no women my age.'' Another put-down: `` There is n't anything I ca n't do now that I could n't do when I was 18 _ which shows you how pathetic I was at 18.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> smokes 15 to 20 cigars and drinks several martinis a day. What do his doctors think of that? `` They're all dead.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> began in show business at the age of 8, quitting school to form a group of child singers known as the Peewee Quartet. Born <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON> to a poor family on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, he had only to look to his 11 brothers and sisters for his own ensemble. He bounced around the vaudeville circuit until he was 27. `` Then people discovered I had a talent _ a big talent. I was married to her for 38 years. `` <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> did n't tell a joke, she explained it,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> recalled of nearly four decades as straight man for the zany comedian. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> admits he was devastated _ personally and professionally _ by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s death in 1964. A decade later, in August 1974, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> underwent a triple heart bypass. At age 78, he was the oldest bypass patient in history at that time. Four months after his surgery, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' longtime friend, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> had been scheduled to star in the movie `` The Sunshine Boys.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was tabbed to take his place, won an Academy Award for best supporting actor, and was on his way to his second time around.

<HEAD>The Artists: Beauty Lies in the Suffering of Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-soo </PERSON> draws stark pictures of exhausted factory workers and peasants clawing the earth with their hands because he sees beauty in their suffering. `` Beauty lies in the ordinary lives and suffering of the common people,'' the artist says with a shy smile. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is a leader of the growing `` Minjung'' or grass-roots school of art that has evolved in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in recent years as a reaction to decades of authoritarian rule and the impact of industrialization. Minjung artists, who have attracted a wide following among young Korean artists, advocate using art to fight for democratic reform by depicting the hardships of poor workers, peasants and slum dwellers. `` Minjung art aims to expose the social evils and injustices in society. It also participates in the movement of the masses,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a quiet, gentle man who often smiles as he explains his ideas. The bold, realistic style of Minjung art and its bleak portrayal of life are considered shocking in a society where artists generally concentrate on landscapes or happy rural scenes. <PERSON> Minjung </PERSON> art is about the suffering of many Koreans who work long hours for a very meager living and spend their lives in poverty, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. It also is about how industrialization has destroyed traditional rural values and made life bleak and polluted, he said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s bold woodcuts and portraits feature haggard men and women drained by unrelenting labor and bleak, hopeless lives. A man claws at the stony earth of his fields, a woman working at a sewing machine in a factory dreams of heaven, a begger huddles in front of a church. `` I want to instill a detailed, concrete sense of reality into my works,'' he said. Many of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s subjects have disproportionately large hands and feet that have become a trademark of his work. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says he does n't know why he makes feet and hands so large Some critics have denounced the new style as violent and crude political propaganda that is not art. `` Skepticism over the quality of the works by Minjung artists lingers on,'' said one critic. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> rejects charges that his work is crude propaganda. He defends it as a reaction to decades of oppressive rule and says his only goals are democracy and aiding the poor. `` You have to compare our works with the violent nature of the political powers that be,'' he said. But <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> also rejects the idea that he is a political artist, saying his work is a repudiation of politics. `` Politics oppresses humans,'' he said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says his works are inspired by the hope that a fair society based on greater equality and compassion can be built. He dreams of a kinder, gentle world and says showing how people suffer can help bring change. `` I'm not a radical,'' he said. `` I'm an optimist.'' Minjung art is also anti-Western because its followers say that Western influence has eroded traditional Korean values and brought industrialization and other dehumanizing influences. `` Western influence has brought with it decadence,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> moved to the countryside two years ago because of concern that industrialization was destroying traditional rural values. His work often features a rural life he fears is slipping away. Some of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s works were recently displayed at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> gallery. A steady flow of visitors viewed the lines of stark woodcuts displayed on whitewashed walls in the grimy, basement gallery. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> admitted the show was a sign of political liberalization and of how artists are allowed freedom. The government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo, which took office in February, has promised to end authoritarian rule and allow complete freedom of expression. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> makes a living as a book illustrator and spends much of his time working to develop Minjung art. He says he wants to develop the quality of the art and establish it alongside other artistic schools. `` We are striving to give better forms and flesh to our ideas,'' he said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Thorogood and Co. Bring Bar Band to Arena Rock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the past decade, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> has gone from playing hole-in-the-wall saloons to headlining stadiums. But the whiskey-voiced rocker figures his career holds a few more roadhouse bars before he hits the retirement home. `` I ca n't wait until I become a has-been _ a has-been that never was, actually,'' he said with a cackle. `` I ca n't wait till that happens, because I know I can make a living playing bars. And have a lot of fun _ a great time.'' Which is, he says, what his band The Destroyers are having now on their national tour _ although <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> makes no bones about saying they'd rather play <ORGANIZATION> Stubb </ORGANIZATION>'s Barbecue, a small <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> blues bar, than Madison Square Garden. `` We started out, and still are, a bar band,'' said <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON>, whose career has kept alive the sound of Muddy Waters, <PERSON> Howlin </PERSON>' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and other blues legends. `` It's just that the bars are a little bigger these days.'' <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> and company are to blame for that. Since 1977, they've cranked out a series of successful albums and singles, starting with a remake of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` Who Do You Love? on their debut album and stretching to the current LP `` Born to Be Bad.'' Despite his success, <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> has not catered to Top 40 radio, studiously avoided studio tricks and stayed about as far from the mainstream as any contemporary band can. `` Even if I tried, I'm not going to be able to get out of this style of playing,'' <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> said during a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> stop in the tour. `` There might be a different hook here or there, but basically it's going to be your two -, three-chord rock or your slow, tough-guy blues `` I do n't want to change that, and I could n't if I wanted o, because I have tried _ I have sat down and tried to play other styles of stuff, and it was a disaster.'' With that in mind, <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> and band included some classic covers on the new album: <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>' `` Shake Your Money Maker,'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s `` You Ca n't Catch Me'' and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>'s `` I'm Movin' On. <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> also wrote several songs in the same vein for `` Born to Be Bad'' _ songs which, he stressed, carry no deeper message than `` let's all have a good time.'' `` I figure, I'm not operating on anybody's skull here. It's not brain surgery, man,'' said <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON>. `` It's just two chords. And people are supposed to dance to it and laugh at it, and two hours later forget about it. That's what entertainment is.'' <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> was introduced to the blues scene in his native <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, an area he quickly admits was no roots-rock hotbed. `` I was so foolish staying in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, because it's not a blues area,'' he said. `` If I had my wits about me, I would have gone to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where people know this sound their whole lives.'' But no matter where he he grew up, <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> believes it was inevitable he'd end up listening to Muddy Waters and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. `` I think the things you're supposed to hear in your life will come to you. You do n't go finding them; they come to you,'' he said. `` So it just came to me a little later.'' Once <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> heard the music, he began taking it to audiences with the zeal of a Bible Belt preacher delivering the good word. The band is constantly on the road: In 1981, they went on a `` 50-50 Tour'' in which they played in all 50 states on 50 consecutive dates. And while they have moved up from bars to arenas, <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON> figures that sooner or later he'll be back on the roadhouse circuit playing for barroom crowds, enjoying his golden years with a cold beer and some hot licks. `` I always thought, wow, would n't it be great if I did ` Bad to the Bone' and I was 60, and I had on a gut on me like -LRB- <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, and I walked out there with a T-shirt that said something like, ` Sex Machine.'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Books That Flip, Flop and Fold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN OKULA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scholars entering <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 3 million-volume Sterling Memorial Library are discovering there's definitely more to a book than its cover The library's `` Eccentric Books'' exhibit includes works containing a rotting tortilla encased in plastic, a miniature stand-up portrait of <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> and a three-dimensional illustration of sperm fertilizing an egg. `` These are more-than-a-book books,'' says <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the library's arts of the book department curator who put together the exhibit. The more than 110 books in the exhibit have flaps, fold-outs, revolving wheels, unusual shapes, cutouts or objects such as a pair of 3-D glasses. Although children's books are represented, most of the volumes are aimed toward adult readers. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> says the earliest known example of an eccentric book is <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s 1474 `` Kalendar,'' also known as `` Regiomontanus.'' The text contains two cutout, movable discs tied onto a diagram that shows the movements of the moon. The <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> exhibit has a fascimile of the book printed in 1937 as well as several original copies of 16th-century books with revolving diagrams by <PERSON> Petrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Apianus </PERSON>, the royal astronomer for <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Another </PERSON> early innovation was the flap, cutout paper pasted onto a book page that either added to an illustration or revealed one when lifted up. Euclid's `` Elements of Geometry,'' translated into English by <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON> and printed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1570, was the oldest example of a flapped book identified by <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. It contains several illustrations of geometrical figures that use flaps to illustrate the solid figure, she says. Anatomy books also made early use of flaps revealing various layers of the body by as early as 1573, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> writes in a catalog of the exhibition. Among them was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>'s 1833 `` Obstetric Tables,'' which had several printings. Fifteen of its lithographed plates contain a total of 50 flaps, with explicit illustrations. There are books with eccentricities in other fields besides the sciences. In the exhibit are children's books with all kinds of innovations, including one that folds out into a five-room miniature house, landscape books, humor books, art books and many more. Pull-tabs depress a computer key in one book and cause a robot's pants to fall down in another In `` The Great Movies Live'' by <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakubowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Meer </PERSON>, paper versions of screen stars in famous scenes from flicks ranging from `` Casablanca'' to `` King Kong'' literally stand up from the pages. In `` 100 Million Million Poems'' by <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Queneau </PERSON>, 14 lines of poetry cut from 10 pages but still attached to the binding can be combined into almost limitless poetic possibilities. <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelham </PERSON>'s `` The Facts of Life,'' published in 1984, uses tabs, wheels, flaps and moving and stationary pop-ups in its illustrations, including one in blue and gray showing the fertilization of a human egg. Included in a category that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> labels artists' book, are <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> artist and English Professor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s two books made out of candy boxes. One is a Whitman Sampler box that contains a mostly visual essay on <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>. The other, the `` Book of Eights'' has the eight dwarfs, a new addition being Stuffy; the eight deadly sins, the eighth being `` boringness''; and the eight wonders of the modern world, which include Trump Tower in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Graceland, the late <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. A 1977 volume of `` Eye,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> art magazine, contains the plastic-encased tortilla Eccentric books published today are especially popular in the children's fields, says <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. Pop-up books, popular in the Victorian age, have been revived by <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> publisher, who manufactures them in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, she says. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> says the idea for the exhibition started when she was invited to give a talk on any subject she chose, which ended up being eccentric books. The librarian found that very little research had been done in the area. She devised the categories such as flap and pop-up to which she assigned the books. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also designed the exhibit's catalog, which contains two pop-ups and a serrated edge. She produced the catalog on a home computer, had its cover printed professionally and bound the 61-page work by hand at night in her home. The exhibit is open through April 15.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Fiddler Vassar Clements And `Hillbilly Jazz'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fiddler </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassar </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> has played country music, jazz, rock' n' roll and classical for groups as diverse as the Grateful Dead and the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION>. And for the past two decades, he's recorded in the top studios with his instrument. It's been a romance of sound separated only by the styles he performs. `` When the rhythm is good, I can play it,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> says. The 59-year-old artist has just released an album with the intriguing title `` New Hillbilly Jazz.'' The name signifies a sound as versatile as the man who plays it. `` It's heavy rhythm, solid, dynamic,'' he said in his soft Southern voice that contrasts the exuberance of his playing. `` But it's not fidgety music. It's smooth, danceable.'' This marks his 20th year in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> where he's added luster to the city's country style after relocating from <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` People ask me what kind of music I'm playing, and I say I do n't know,'' he said. `` It's just happy, moving music.'' Along the way, he played with rock veterans the Grateful Dead on their `` Wake of the Flood'' album and toured with them when they were known as Old and In the Way. It was a departure from the country music he grew up playing when he and his cousins formed a band. `` It was a challenge and I loved that,'' he recalled about his days with the Dead. `` It's exciting to take a chance.'' He also played with the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION>, joining his close friend <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON> when <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> was a guest artist in a Pops concert. In addition, he recorded with the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION>. That was by coincidence. He was working on a recording session when someone asked him if he wanted to stay and play on another one. `` I did n't know until later it was the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. He's had no problem adjusting to the various styles, even on short notice such as the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION>' session. `` You just go in and do it. After so many years, no tunes change much. I've never had a problem with that.'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> taught himself to play at age 7 and has no formal training. The first song he learned was `` There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor.'' `` It took forever,'' he said. `` It was God's gift, something born in me,'' he said about his talent. `` I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the -LRB- Grand Ole -RRB- Opry some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I did n't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. `` I do n't read music. I play what I hear.'' But he understands how helpful it is for youngsters to be grounded in classical music and formal training. `` It should help them,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said. He was employed at the Kennedy Space Center in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for a year in the mid-1960s, working on plumbing. At various times, he also worked in a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> paper mill, was a switchman for <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, sold insurance and had a potato chip franchise. But music was always part of his life. `` I'd always play. Square dances, anything,'' he said. All the performing carried him to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> where one of his first breaks was being featured on the album `` Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. He then became heavily in demand for recording sessions of all types. This year, he was nominated for a Grammy Award with French jazz violinist <PERSON> Stephane </PERSON> <PERSON> Grappelli </PERSON> for their `` Together at Last.'' `` It was a truly great time,'' he said about working with <PERSON> Grappelli </PERSON>. `` It was a challenge, but it came easy. We felt alike on a lot of things.'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> wo n't say that he's getting better at playing, but prefers to say that it just comes easier. `` If I quit improving, I'd have to quit. It would be work and there'd be no sense staying in a rut and not learning anything. I'd hate to play the same way all the time It would become mechanical.'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, who owns three fiddles and still practices some, has no favorite song. `` When things go right, I enjoy playing all of them, anything that comes up.'' Similarly, he does n't mind if his instrument is called a fiddle or a violin. `` I say fiddle, but if someone says violin it does n't matter.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which resisted <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s previous moves to snatch it from <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, says it will study <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s latest, sweetened $ 507 million buyout offer. The giant appliance maker's new offer for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> came on Monday just hours after <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> filed suit challenging <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s agreement to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 470 million deal. GE on Monday increased its tender offer for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s outstanding shares by $ 9 to $ 54 a share, topping <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 50-a-share offer in a bidding war that, according to some analysts, may have run its course. `` The prices are pretty generous to what we on Wall Street would call the intrinsic value of <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> rose $ 2.50 a share to close at $ 55.50 in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, adding to Friday's $ 5.75 a share runup In a statement issued after the stock market closed, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said it was reviewing <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s new tender offer and planned a board meeting later in the week to determine the company's position on the sweetened bid. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> began the legal battle last week, suing GE on the grounds the <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, Conn.-based conglomerate tried to `` sabotage'' a Whirlpool-Roper merger with a competing bid. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> rebuffed a merger proposal last November, and contended the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> board authorized a $ 37.50-a-share merger with <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> threatened to mount a hostile takeover bid, according to <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> documents. GE, which on March 6 made its initial $ 45-a-share offer, alleged <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> failed to `` test the price'' before agreeing to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> also contended <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> concealed <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in the company when it advised shareholders to tender their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> also gave <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbor </PERSON>, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> a so-called `` lockup option'' to purchase 1.6 million newly issued shares for $ 37.50 each if their deal fell through, which would make any subsequent <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> acquisition more expensive. GE is seeking to block the issue and transfer of those shares. In a separate suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> claimed both <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> failed to adequately disclose terms of their merger agreement under <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> laws and neglected to mention <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in <LOCATION> Roper </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> alleged in its suit last week that a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> executive tried to persuade <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> to break its contract with <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>. The suit said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> `` intentionally, maliciously and unjustifiedly engaged in a continuing course of conduct to sabotage'' the deal. Part of <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit seeks $ 117 million in damages, or the difference between its $ 50-a-share offer and original offer. GE vowed to `` vigorously defend itself'' against the charges and is seeking to transfer the suit from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to federal court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, last week endorsed <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s sweetened bid. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s president and chief executive officer, said then that the company `` has a strong desire to see this combination successfully completed,'' although he had no further comment when contacted Monday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitwam </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, stated Monday that his company remains committed to pursuing its attempts to block GE and acquire <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>. Analysts say a <ORGANIZATION> Roper-Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> merger would move <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> ahead of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's leading appliance maker. For GE, acquiring the appliance and lawn equipment maker would enhance its supplier relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and give it a valuable share of the gas stove market. Analysts estimate that roughly two-thirds of <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s sales come from its agreement to supply <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> with its kitchen appliance and lawn equipment products. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s bid stems from its decision last year to expand its market share by selling gas stoves. Rather than manufacture the gas stoves, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> now purchases them from four companies, including <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Batty </PERSON>.

 Still smarting from a major courtroom defeat last week, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it is working on other options in its battle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> got another legal setback on Monday and faces further courtroom entanglements over its attempt to acquire <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, which has accepted a rival offer from <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. A federal judge on Monday rebuffed <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to extend its $ 6.18 billion tender offer so it would expire simultaneously with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer, if he removed <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, in a closed-door session, said the poison pill would remain in place at least until <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> makes a final recommendation to its shareholders, said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raeside </PERSON>. In a key ruling on Friday, the judge had denied <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s request to block the use of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s poison pill, which <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> says will prevent it from completing any takeover of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> The defense makes a takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shareholders to buy more of the company's stock at a steep discount. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolaides </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the Toronto-based developer was `` definitely working on other options.'' She said she could not elaborate on what those options were. However, there were reports that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was considering sweetening its bid or proposing a friendly merger. Neither tactic has met with success in the past during the company's months-long quest for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. In another matter, Judge Sand scheduled a Wednesday hearing over a Macy complaint that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> made false statements in full-page advertisements in Thursday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and Wall Street Journal. Separately, <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> announced that the waiting period during which the federal government could ask for information about the possible antitrust implications of a <ORGANIZATION> Macy-Federated </ORGANIZATION> merger had expired with no further requests. A request would extend the waiting period automatically. The retailer also confirmed it had agreed to sell 11 of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 14 <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Straus stores if it wins the takeover fight. The agreement, reached with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> over the weekend, calls for <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> to divest <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> A & amp; S stores because they are in direct competition with <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> branches. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where Macy stores would compete with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s chain, Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said the state will not oppose a Macy-Federated combination But analysts speculate that <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> might sell the <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s stores anyway. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> is conducting a $ 6.3 billion tender offer for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> under an agreement with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> management. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> is offering $ 77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, for a total of $ 5.4 billion. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> would exchange shares in the merged company, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and issue convertible debt securities for the remainder of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.5 million Analysts have estimated the total value of the offer at $ 6.3 billion. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock rose 62 -LCB- cents to $ 66.87 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s bid is a two-step, all-cash package that would be worth $ 68 a share, or $ 6.18 billion. It is offering $ 75 each for 70.5 million Federated shares, and proposes to acquire the remaining stock for $ 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer expires at midnight EST April 4. The <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> offer must remain open at least until midnight Friday, pending a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruling on whether <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> must submit documents on its financing for the takeover.

 The union trying to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from selling its lucrative <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> air shuttle says it is happy with penalties a federal judge has levied on the carrier, but the company says it plans to appeal the sanctions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> on Monday said he would fine Eastern $ 10,000 per day if the airline commits any future violations of a court order that had blocked the shuttle deal. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> also ordered Eastern to halt all efforts to get government permission to go through with the sale. And he said the airline's top officials would have to write to all 32,000 Eastern employees, informing them that the carrier had flouted an earlier court order and promising that no further violations would occur `` He imposed most of the sanctions we asked for,'' <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There were n't any surprises, but it's pretty strong. But company officials insisted their court fight was not over. `` Eastern continues to believe strongly that we have not violated any court orders,'' the company said in a written statement read by spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> from the airline's headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, said the airline would go to court today to appeal the penalty and the original finding of contempt. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> found Eastern in contempt on March 10 for violating an order he had issued July 2. That order had forbidden the company from changing working conditions of the 12,000 mechanics and other ground workers represented by the machinists. Eastern, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Feb. 5 that it would sell its shuttle to a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for $ 225 million. The shuttle flies between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, has argued that financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> needed the cash. But union leaders have insisted the move was aimed at stripping labor of power at the carrier by transferring thousands of workers to another corporate entity within <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Air. The machinists' union had asked <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> to force a court appearance by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to discuss the shuttle deal. But in his ruling Monday, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> could send another corporate representative. The union had also asked <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> to fine Eastern $ 20,000 daily for future violations of the judge's orders. The judge instead ruled the airline would face $ 10,000-a-day fines for violations committed after April 5. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> did not grant a union request that the airline restore the jobs of all Eastern employees who quit because of the announcement that the shuttle would be sold. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, also the corporate parent of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, took over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, a large carrier that lost $ 182 million last year. Since that time, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has sought wage concessions from unions and has tried selling several of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s most profitable assets to other <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries that he also controls. Unions representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees have waged well-publicized fights to thwart him.

 Investor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>, who says his plans to boost shareholder values have been rebufffed repeatedly by <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is moving to take over the company. An investment group led by <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> said Monday it was offering $ 60 cash a share, or about $ 594 million, for the 89 percent of the railroad concern's common stock that it does not already own. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor, in a letter to the company's management, also indicated he would attempt to place his own slate of directors on the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> board if it rejected or failed to act on the buyout offer by April 4. <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>, which also has interests in financial services, said its board would consider the all-cash proposal soon at a special meeting. The company has nearly 11.1 million shares outstanding, and the <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> group claims it controls about 1.2 million shares. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 8.75 a share to $ 55 on Monday. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> outlined the merger proposal in a letter to <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>, and requested an opportunity to negotiate `` all aspects of the offer, including price.'' He said completing the proposal was subject to reaching a definitive agreement, approval by the requisite number of directors and stockholders and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> said he had made various proposals to company management over the past eight months on ways to maximize shareholder values. `` Unfortunately, you have rejected each of my suggestions,'' <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> wrote. In addition, he said he found it `` dismaying'' that the board erected obstacles `` designed to entrench itself and to prevent stockholders from realizing a full return on their investment.'' Among these steps, <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> cited the recent issuance of about 1.4 million shares, or almost 15 percent of the company's then-outstanding common stock, to employee stock ownership plans at $ 49 a share `` This could only have been motivated by the board's desire to place substantial voting power in its hands as a means of opposing'' proposals that may be brought before its shareholders, the letter read. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> also cited <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s continued efforts to acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> despite <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s `` binding agreement for its sale to the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. Other than <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>'s announcement that the board of directors would consider the offer at a special meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> indicated it had no further comment until the board had an opportunity to study the offer. <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which operates on about 1,500 miles of track in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It also owns 87 percent of <ORGANIZATION> DST </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City-based concern that provides data systems and record-keeping services for mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services providers.

<TEXT>
 The British investor pursuing a hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says he is willing to acquire only the company's core construction materials business _ which the company already has said it may sell as a defensive measure. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, who along with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has offered to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> for $ 56 a share, or $ 1.6 billion, made his offer in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> on Saturday. In the letter, the bidders raised their offer to $ 56 a share from the initial $ 45 a share bid rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, which also manufactures chemicals. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, chairman of the British construction company <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said previously he would sell the chemicals business if he gained control of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. His new offer remains open until April 1. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has stated that under a defensive recapitalization plan it is contemplating, it might sell part or all of the construction materials business to third parties. Selling the businesses to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> might save the rest of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, but `` I do n't know how bright a move that would be,'' said securities analyst <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` It's the lion's share of the company's earnings and revenue.'' The construction materials and paving services businesses are on solid footing after five years of retrenchment at <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The company reported 1987 earnings of $ 10.8 million on revenue of $ 1.5 billion. `` The real persistent grower for the corporation has been the construction materials business,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanters </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` The chemicals business, they feel, is able to do some sustainable growth, but it's been kind of a more volatile business in recent years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 3.75 a share to $ 57.50 on Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Beazer proposed meeting <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> as early as Sunday, but no meeting was held and none has been planned, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> declined further comment beyond Sunday's announcement that management would study Beazer's latest proposals.

 The dollar was mixed but generally firmer in early European trading today. Gold prices eased. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 127.07 yen, down 1.28 yen from Friday. But the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> finish was an improvement on trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday, when Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday and the dollar closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 126.85 yen. In later trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, the dollar was quoted at 127.30 yen. Dealers in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> blamed the drop largely on fears the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit will grow in the second half of this year. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6915 West German marks, up from 1.6880; 1.3980 Swiss francs, up from 1.3970; 5.7505 French francs, up from 5.7380; 1.8964 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8970; 1,252.50 Italian lire, up from 1,249.25; and 1.2472 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2494 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.8285, unchanged from late Monday.

 The dollar fell 1.28 yen on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange markets today and the leading stock index fell more than 123 points following declines on markets in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> blamed fears over the increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and increasing interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the declines. The dollar opened at 126.96 yen, down 1.39 yen from its close Friday, when it gained 0.92 yen. Monday was a Japanese national holiday. In today's trading, the dollar ranged between 126.80 yen and 127.16 yen before closing at 127.07 yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 93.97 points Friday, closed at 25,842.75 points, down 123.51 points, or 0.48 percent. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the yen will continue to strengthen based on worries over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and increasing interest rates as reflected in bond market increases from 8.5 percent to 8.72 percent. He predicted the yen will continue to strengthen and could hit 115 to the dollar by the end of the year if the present trends continue. `` We just do n't expect the trade deficit to improve in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We expect the decline to begin in the second half of this year.'' The dollar's sharp decline in early trading today followed similar declines on overseas markets Monday, said a currency dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Stock prices were narrowly mixed at midday Tuesday, with trading depressed by declines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and by the lack of institutional buying interest in the market. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was off 3.6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,837.5. Volume was a modest 211.7 million shares, up from 191.7 million shares at the same time a day earlier. The market remained locked in a narrow range on Tuesday with institutions again reluctant to buy stock near the start of the current extended trading account, dealers said. The small size of individual share transactions indicated that Tuesday's trading was dominated by private client orders rather than institutional investors, they added. Investors have been reluctant to take major decisions at the start of the three-week account which began last Friday, extended from the normal two-week period to take in the Easter holiday weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> divides trading into either two-week or three-week periods for accounting purposes. Trades generally must be completed within 10 days of a period ending. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> share prices also were depressed Tuesday by previous falls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, dealers said.

^Durable Goods Orders Fell Sharply Last Month</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods continued to fall sharply in February, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 111.4 billion last month, a 1.8 percent decline which was identical to the drop in January. It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable goods orders had been down for two consecutive months. The back-to-back drops surprised analysts, who had been predicting that orders would turn up again in February following a January decline which was blamed on volatility in the aircraft sector. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the federal government ran a $ 23.9 billion budget deficit in February, following a rare surplus the previous month. The $ 16.1 billion January surplus occurred because that month's Social Security checks were mailed early and counted in the December spending figures For the first five months of the current budget year, the government has run up a deficit of $ 89.7 billion, 4.9 percent lower than the deficit incurred in the same period a year ago, according to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> calculations. On Wall Street, analysts blamed inflation fears and lingering post-crash anxiety for the broad decline in stock prices. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell sharply at the opening and remaining lower throughout the session, closing down 20.23 points at 2,067.14. Broader market indices also fell. On the bond market, analysts said prices slipped and interest rates edged up in light trading that reflected continued uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond fell \ point, or about $ 2.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield rose to 8.70 percent from 8.67 percent late Friday. Foreign exchange trading also was quiet, with the dollar responding to declines in stocks and bonds by dropping against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar. Oil futures prices rallied, with crude piercing the $ 17-a-barrel level before sliding back in late trading following a statement by Saudi King Fahd on prices and production. Fahd suggested that cheating on production quotas and prices by some members of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> encouraged further weakness in prices. That punctured the rally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where contracts for April delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intemediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed at $ 16.49 per barrel, down 9 cents from Friday. The April contract had been up as much as 45 cents during the day.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods fell again sharply in February, the government said today in a report that surprised analysts who had been looking for a rebound. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 111.4 billion last month, a 1.8 percent decline which was identical to the drop in January. It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable goods orders had been down for two consecutive months. The back-to-back declines were the largest since a 2.3 percent plunge last August. The two drops surprised analysts, who had been predicting that orders would turn up again in February following a January decline which was blamed on volatility in the aircraft sector. The weakness provides evidence that the economy slowed during the early part of 1988 as businesses cut back on orders in an effort to get control of bulging inventories. `` The economy is weak. It has n't fully recovered from the stock market fallout,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who earlier had been forecasting a recession, said he now believes the country will be able to muddle through without a downturn during this presidential election year. He said he was expecting overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national production, to average around 1.8 percent in the first three months of the year, down from GNP growth of 4.5 in the fourth quarter. The weakness last month was widespread, with only the transportation sector showing any strength. Orders for cars, trucks and aircraft showed a 3.5 percent gain to $ 29.3 billion following a 9 percent drop in January. Orders in the volatile defense category fell 7.9 percent to $ 7.8 billion. Without this decline, total orders would have fallen a slightly smaller 1.3 percent. The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good indicator of industry investment plans, fell 5.9 percent last month. This sector is expected to provide much of the strength for the economy this year as businesses step up investment spending to meet growing export demand. Orders for electrical machinery fell 7.3 percent while orders in the non-electrical machinery sector were down 8.8 percent, the biggest drop for any sector. Orders for primary metals such as steel dropped 0.2 percent following a 14.4 percent plunge in January. Shipments of durable goods dipped 0.1 percent in February to $ 108.8 billion as a large decline in machinery shipments was partially offset by an increase in transportation.

 <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> today boosted his bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to $ 295 million while also waging a court fight to help him win control of the hotel-casino company. <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainer-businessman's private investment company, said in a statement today that it decided to increase its initial bid of $ 225 million, or $ 35-a-share, after reviewing `` appraisals regarding the value of Resorts.'' Based on 6.43 million Class A and Class B shares outstanding, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s latest bid for both classes of stock is valued at about $ 46 a share. Separately, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said Monday it filed a $ 500 million federal lawsuit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> against real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and Resorts' directors, claiming breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders, among other things. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who has voting control of Resorts and is the company's chairman, sued <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> last week, accusing the entertainer of interfering with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s contractual agreement to acquire complete control over Resorts Since making its initial offer Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it may raise the price if justified by non-public information from Resorts, a hotel-casino concern with operations in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> made that information available late last week. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who is making his own $ 22-per-share bid for the Resorts stock he does n't already own, said he wo n't boost his offer and has maintained that he will not sell his shares to <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. Resorts' board said it decided not to pursue <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s initial bid because, in light of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s rejection, the issue was moot. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said in a statement today that he would not approve any deal between Resorts and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> `` unless class A shareholders receive a premium over my prior $ 35-a-share offer.'' The non-public documents were contained in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> made on Friday to supplement his tender offer for Resorts. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s tender offer, which had been scheduled to expire Monday, was extended until 12:01 a.m. EST on April 1. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>, said the documents included a $ 1.3 billion appraisal of Resorts' properties, including a when-completed value for its luxurious but troubled Taj Mahal hotel-casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The appraiser further said it was prepared to support a bank mortgage loan of $ 550 million guaranteed by Resorts, <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> said. `` Based on those numbers, we may be able to sweeten our $ 225 million bid,'' <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> said Monday. The $ 550 million mortgage is the amount <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has said will be needed to complete the Taj Mahal. When Resorts began work on the project in 1984, it estimated the total price at $ 535 million. That figure has since soared to $ 938.5 million based on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s estimates <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> became involved with Resorts last year when the company ran into financial difficulties with the proposed 42-floor, 1,250-room Taj Mahal. He bought up most of Resorts' Class B common stock, which carries 100 votes per share, thus giving him 88 percent voting control. He also pledged to help arrange financing for the costly Taj Mahal project and, in exchange, was granted a five-year operating contract for Resorts properties valued at about $ 100 million. Resorts has 752,000 Class B shares. It has 5.7 million Class A shares that carry one vote each.

 In this corner: affable, courtly and somewhat portly <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the singer and talk show host who in recent years has emerged as a wily and successful businessman. And in the far corner: brash <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, best known for building designer-label skyscrapers, owning casinos and having more than a modest dose of braggadocio. Late last week, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> squared off over control of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the New Jersey-based hotel-casino concern that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has been offering to acquire for $ 22 per share, or about to acquire. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> last week offered $ 35 per share, or $ 225 million for the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company, which also has operations in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The battle escalated today when <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> increased his bid to $ 295 million, which values both Class A and Class B Resorts shares at about $ 46 each. Both contestants among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wealthiest men. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is listed by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as worth at least $ 850 million, and personally claims $ 3 billion in wealth. Forbes lists <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> as worth $ 300 million. For 23 years, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> served as host of the popular `` <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> Show,'' one of TV's longest-running series, winning 10 Emmy Awards in the process. In 1986, he sold privately-held <ORGANIZATION> Merv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> _ producer of the `` <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> Show'' and two of his other successful creations, `` Wheel of Fortune'' and `` Jeopardy'' _ to <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for a reported $ 250 million. But he remains chairman of the company, and there is speculation he may take over as host of `` Wheel of Fortune'' when host <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> leaves to do his own show. Unlike many entertainers who squander their money through bad investments and mismanagement, the 63-year-old <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has earned a reputation in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> as a shrewd businessman. He has parlayed his entertainment fortune into a business empire that includes radio stations, a major closed-circuit television operation widely used at racetracks, and extensive real estate holdings in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, whose hobbies are music, tennis and good food, lives stylishly, but not ostentatiously, in a 10,000-square-foot <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> mansion near the homes of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> and investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> By contrast, the 42-year-old <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who in a decade transformed himself from a local landlord into a national real estate mogul, has worked hard to make his name synonymous with ostentation. He routinely travels in one of his fleet of five helicopters. When <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricker </PERSON> was ousted as chief executive of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> amid criticism over his imperial lifestyle, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> purchased his luxurious <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 private jet. His primary home is a $ 10 million triplex penthouse atop his glitzy Trump Tower in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. For relaxation, he retreats to his 118-room mansion in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, or his 15-bedroom Georgian manor in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` I ca n't afford for things not to be the best,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has said, contending the glamour attached to his name _ and the buildings that bear his name _ allows him to attract prices of $ 1,700 per square foot for some of his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> condos. With a massive war chest to spend, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was attracted by the lure of profits in takeover speculation. In the past year, he bought stakes in <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> Mfg. <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and raked in about $ 122 million in profits when he later sold the stock to the company or rival suitors. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he was considering buying up to 24.9 percent of entertainment conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> which is frequently mentioned as a takeover target. But nothing has come of it. Likewise, nothing has come of his indications in January that he might buy up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ which later became the takeover target of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But when <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> decided to battle <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for Resorts, the fight generally was expected to be short and victorious for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> is offering more money, but <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> holds 88 percent of Resorts' voting power through his ownership of nearly all of its Class B common stock, which carries 100 votes per share. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has insisted he will oppose <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s proposal, and for that reason Resorts' board decided it was moot to pursue the issue with the entertainer. But <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has persisted. On Monday, he slapped <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and Resorts' directors with a $ 500 million lawsuit, accusing them, among other things, of breach of fiduciary duty. That action came after <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> on Friday filed a $ 250 million suit against <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and his allies, claiming fraud, stock market manipulation and interference with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s contractual arrangements with Resorts. Meanwhile, some holders of Resorts' 5.7 million Class A shares who had earlier indicated they would support <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 22-per-share offer now are having second thoughts, their lawyers say.

 A unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ruled that states are barred from regulating the way interstate natural gas companies issue securities to finance their operations. The court, ruling in a dispute between the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a Detroit-based pipeline, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has sole authority to regulate such financing. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the state authority sought by the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> agency is pre-empted by the federal Natural Gas Act of 1938. A federal appeals court previously had ruled against the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law required pipeline companies to get advance approval from the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> before issuing securities. The law was passed to assure that the securities were being issued for a legal purpose _ one related to the more efficient delivery of natural gas.

 Stocks turned mixed today, strengthened by higher bond prices and takeover-related buying, but restrained by investor reluctance to participate in a market still suffering post-crash uncertainty. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.16 points to 2,068.30 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all listed issues rose 0.10 to 151.57 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s market value index rose 0.20 to 298.38. Gaining issues barely outnumbered losers on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 613 up, 558 down and 527 unchanged. Volume totaled 45.5 million shares after 90 minutes. Rising prices in the bond market injected some optimism on Wall Street because they dampened anxiety over inflation and higher interest rates. Bonds were buoyed by lower oil prices and a government report that showed a surprising drop in factory orders for durable goods in February. Some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers, reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past several weeks. Nevertheless, stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed that many investors remain reluctant to re-enter the market in the aftermath of the October crash. `` People still are wounded,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Those wounds have not scarred over yet.

<HEAD>Robins To File Another Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it will submit another amended reorganization plan as the result of a court hearing on the adequacy of the company's disclosure statement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> conducted the hearing Monday, listening to a series of objections to the disclosure statement. The document is the basis by which women with <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> injury claims and other creditors of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> will decide how to vote on the company's reorganization plan. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Monday evening that as a result of the hearing, the company `` will submit a sixth amended and restated plan of reorganization incorporating certain changes,'' mostly in the wording of the statement. The new plan will be filed in bankruptcy court by March 28, he said. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> set an April 25 deadline for mailing the plan of reorganization to <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants and the company's other creditors for a vote. The votes must be received by July 11 and a confirmation hearing will be July 18, <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> also said he hoped to choose by April 11 the five trustees who will administer the nearly $ 2.5 billion compensation fund for <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> victims. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a related action Monday, let stand a ruling against a $ 15 million emergency fund to help women who became infertile from using the intrauterine device, which <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> sold in the early 1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also refused to review a ruling that placed on hold several lawsuits against the insurer of the IUD. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since August 1985. The Richmond-based maker of pharmaceuticals sought court protection from creditors as lawsuits mounted against the birth control device. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, attorney for 35 users of the IUD, told <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> the disclosure statement should not go out because it appeared to give a discharge from liability to not only <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> but to its insurer, corporate directors and members of the <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' family. Attorneys for <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that insured the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> said claimants voting to ratify the reorganization plan are not prevented from subsequently going to court. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>'s objection was overruled. An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> challenged an arrangement for <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> to repay the federal tax agency's priority claim over a six-year period. `` We're being asked to make a $ 62 million unsecured loan at prime interest,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> tax lawyer. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>, however, overruled the objection. `` It's your own fault,'' the judge told <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` I asked you to settle it ... and you could n't do it.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>' decision to reject the $ 15 million emergency fund, which <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> had approved as a means of helping women still of child-bearing age to regain fertility through special surgery. The emergency fund was challenged by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' stockholders as giving preferential treatment to a select group of claims while the final reorganization was pending. The high court's decision not to review the stay of lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> and the 4th Circuit. The appeals court said the suits brought by women in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> inevitably would pull in <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> and thus would detract from the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.

<HEAD>Will Third Try Be Lucky For Casinos In Detroit?
^LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Once again, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is asking itself whether the neon glare of a colony of gambling casinos can attract cash and jobs to a city short on both. Voters in the nation's sixth-largest city rejected casino gambling in 1976 and 1981 by margins of 3-to-2 in advisory votes. This time, a battalion of civic leaders is studying the issue at the behest of Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> A. Young amid criticism from local pulpits and unfavorable results of a recent poll. A 67-member commission will issue a report on the casino questions by mid-May. Even a favorable recommendation would have to be followed by another city-wide referendum and approval by the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Legislature and Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. Following Young's lead, most members of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> have taken a carefully noncommittal public stance on the issue. `` I do n't know if casino gambling is good for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' said co-chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, former chief judge of <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recorder </ORGANIZATION>'s Court. `` I never really sat down and concentrated on it. I can think of good things and bad things. But I do n't have all the facts.'' To Young, the vagaries of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s manufacturing economy justify another look at casino gambling. Unemployment, which has risen and fallen with the uneven fortunes of the auto industry, peaked at more than 20 percent in the mid-1970s and averaged about 11.5 percent in 1987, more than 3 percentage points higher than the statewide rate. While auto sales have recently shown some improvement, the industry is struggling to protect jobs these days, not create them. `` I do n't think it's a panacea to all our problems,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in announcing the casino study. `` By the same token, I do n't believe that any enterprise that offers the prospect of 50,000 jobs can be cavalierly dismissed, especially without an in-depth examination. Other than citing 50,000 potential construction and casino jobs, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has been reserved about who would develop the facilities or where they would be located. Specifics have come from real estate developer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, who for several years has proposed developing as many as 12 casinos on <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isle </ORGANIZATION>, an island park in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, however, has been excluded from the commission and has been criticized by Young for acting without proper authority. `` Will it be the major industry in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>? Absolutely not,'' said commission co-chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stella </PERSON>, a suburban business executive. `` In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it is n't; in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> it's not If it's going to be here, it's going to help create jobs'' and augment the local tourism and convention trade, he said. `` This might create some jobs. Jobs to chauffeur people, be a bodyguard or shuffling chips,'' said a critic <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovenko </PERSON>, a professor of law and psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Casinos have provided thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of revenue for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> since they were legalized in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, chairman of the Urban Planning and <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said casinos have fulfilled their darker prophecies, too. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, who coauthored a 1983 book, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the jobs created have been mostly menial employment. Higher positions have been filled with outsiders, including experienced <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> dealers, and workers skimmed from other fields, such as nurses whose interpersonal skills qualified them for jobs as dealers. <PERSON> Slovenko </PERSON> also was unimpressed by the potential property tax base created by multimillion-dollar casinos, saying, `` Everything that's coming into the city has got so many -LRB- tax -RRB- abatements, they end up hardly paying anything. `` You're potentially creating a monster with limited economic benefits, unless it's really tightly linked to hotels and downtown convention facilities ... as an ancillary device,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. Other critics have accused Young of stacking the commission with casino supporters, although <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> estimated that backers and opponents each comprise about 10 percent of its membership and the rest, including himself, are undecided Casino opponents, led by <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> accountant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully challenged Young in the 1985 mayoral election, collected enough signatures to place a casino referendum on the Aug. 2 primary ballot. Results of one poll and the potential influence of hundreds of preachers appear to point toward defeat of the issue.

 The recent surge in oil prices ground to a halt when the markets got word of Saudi King Fahd's latest statements on the current state of prices and crude production. Fahd suggested in a statement issued Monday that cheating on quotas and prices by some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> encouraged further weakness in prices. That sent prices into full reverse on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where contracts for April delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intemediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, gave up an early 45-cent gain to close at $ 16.49 per barrel, down 9 cents from Friday. Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating oil closed up 0.35 cent at 45.40 cents per gallon, after having risen to 46.70 cents per gallon earlier. Unleaded gasoline gave up a 1.41-cent gain to close up 0.12 cent at 46.11 cents a gallon. The decline continued in early trading today. West Texas Intermediate was down 28 cents to $ 16.11 a barrel, while heating oil was off 0.05 cent to 43.35 cents a gallon and gasoline fell 0.51 cent to 45.60 cents a gallon. `` The basic factor in balancing supply and demand is the commitment of all member states to OPEC-decreed quotas and prices. But if one member fails to live up to this commitment, then the result will affect the market. This is what we witness presently,'' the official Saudi news agency quoted Fahd as saying. `` Under these circumstances, it would be difficult to ask those committed -LRB- to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output and price controls -RRB- to modify the situation at the expense of their quotas,'' the king said. Analysts said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is believed to have been discounting its oil lately, and that some traders interpreted <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>'s remarks as justifying that action. As such, it undermined a recent rally by reiterating the kingdom's well-known postition that it would not sacrifice its own production or prices to bolster the market while other cartel members continue to cheat. Prices, which had been sagging, rose strongly after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, said last Thursday he would announce new measures to bring stability to the market at a press conference today. However, a source close to <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said today that the press conference was expected to focus on <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s domestic oil policy, although questions on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> might be raised by reporters. In addition, a spokesman for the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Nigerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the press conference, although originally scheduled for today, was more likely to take place Wednesday or Thursday. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>'s announcement last Thursday came one day after he declared he would not seek an early meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers, despite a weeks-long trend of eroding prices at the time. Thus, many analysts said Monday they were not certain what measures <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> could announce that could have any substantive effect on prices. `` Most people do n't believe he's got anything new to tell the world,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, vice president for energy futures in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Commodities, said he believed there were fears prices would drop sharply, once disappointment over <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>'s comments set into the market _ and that the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> king had thus stepped in to soften the `` I think that's why <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> made the statement today,'' <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said.

 Stocks turned mixed today, strengthened by higher bond prices and takeover-related buying, but restrained by investor reluctance to participate in a market still suffering post-crash uncertainty. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.49 points to 2,065.65 by noon on Wall Street. Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all listed issues was unchanged at 151.47 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s market value index rose 0.16 to 298.34. Gaining and losing issues were about even on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 636 up, 645 down and 520 unchanged. Volume totaled 65.3 million shares in the morning session, compared with 65.76 million Monday morning. Rising prices in the bond market provided some optimism to Wall Street because they dampened anxiety over inflation and higher interest rates. Bonds were buoyed by lower oil prices and a government report that showed a surprising drop in factory orders for durable goods in February. Some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers, reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past several weeks. Nevertheless, stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed that many investors remain reluctant to re-enter the market in the aftermath of the October crash. `` People still are wounded,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Those wounds have not scarred over yet.

<HEAD>High Court Rejects IRS Attempt to Impose Stiffer Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to impose stiffer taxes when individuals or business partnerships form corporations to obtain financing. By an 8-0 vote, the court said real estate developers in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> should not be subjected to a heavier tax burden because they formed corporations for the sole purpose of borrowing money. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>, either individually or in partnership with others, developed eight apartment complexes in the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, area beginning in 1968. To obtain construction-financing loans, <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> formed corporations to borrow the money at 8 percent interest. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s usury law at the time limited the interest non-corporate borrowers could be charged to 7 percent, and lenders were not willing to finance <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>'s projects at that rate When <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> and his partners sought to claim business losses connected with the apartment projects on their individual federal income taxes, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> disallowed it. The tax agency said the losses must be attributed to the corporations, deemed to be the true owners of the apartment complexes. That designation worked to the tax disadvantage of <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> and his partners. A federal appeals court ruled against the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, and today's decision upheld that ruling Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said the corporations had been formed for a legitimate, non-manipulative purpose. `` It seems to us that ... tax-avoiding manipulation -LRB- is -RRB- adequately avoided when ... the corporation is acting as agent for its shareholders with respect to a particular asset -LRB- the apartment complexes -RRB- is set forth in a written agreement at the time the asset is acquired,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. He also noted that the corporations at issue in this case functioned `` as agent and not principal with respect to the asset for all purposes, and the corporation is held out as the agent and not principal in all dealings with third parties relating to the asset.'' The case is Commissioner, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>, 86-1672.

<HEAD>De Benedetti Wins 3.53 Percent More of Societe Generale in Public
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Italian investor <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> has increased his holdings in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> by 3.53 percent, but it was not known if his alliance held a majority stake in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company, officials said Tuesday. An official at <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION>'s French investment company <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be named, did not know whether the public offer gave <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and his allies control of the company. This alliance claimed to control 47.01 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s shares before Tuesday. The newly purchased shares would apparently raise this to 50.54 percent. But the <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> official said the 47.01 percent might have included some shares from the public offer. On March 10, a Franco-Belgian alliance opposing <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> claimed to control 50.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday's announcement was the latest twist in one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s biggest and most complex takeover battles It failed to provide definite clues about the outcome, more than two months after <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> first announced his bid for 166-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. On March 10, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> called for shareholders meeting, which should make it clear which side has a majority. The meeting is set for April 14. Meanwhile, a court case was still pending on a <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> capital increase to fend off <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. The ruling in that case might still dramatically change the stakes each side claims to hold. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm through which <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> was vying for control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday it had obtained 1.087 million additional shares, or 3.53 percent of the company's total share capital, including warrants. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> launched a public offer for the extra shares on Feb. 15. The bid was to have expired March 4 but has since been extended. The offer was designed to acquire 2.1 million shares, or about 7 percent of the share capital of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> offered 8,000 francs, or $ 228, for ordinary shares in the last stage of its public offer. Reacting to Tuesday's announcement, the management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, said there were no defections from the Franco-Belgian alliance to <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION>' camp. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> wants to turn <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> into the platform of a pan-European holding company while the Franco-Belgian group wants to keep the company firmly entrenched in the Belgian economic fabric. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> announced its net profit in 1987 fell 22.1 percent to stand at 4.138 billion francs. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has a stake in over 1,200 companies world-wide and the government has stressed the company is vital for its investment strategy, technological development and its relations with its former colony <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION> group consists of <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Swiss bank <ORGANIZATION> Companie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> et d'Investissements and the food giant <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, two Belgian partners and several smaller allies. The Franco-Belgian alliance is anchored around the French investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Companie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and includes several other partners.

<HEAD>Jurors Award $7.95 Million in Delta Crash Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury has awarded a record $ 7.95 million to the estate of an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive and his wife killed in a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> crash outside <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, including more than $ 6 million for his lost potential earnings at the computer company. The jury at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> deliberated just five hours before returning its verdict at 8:30 p.m. Monday in the suit by the estate of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estridge </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and his wife <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Estridge </PERSON>, who received much of the credit for moving <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> into the personal computer market, and his wife were among 137 people killed when the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 crashed on approach at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Aug. 2, 1985. `` I thought it would have been more, and it should have been more,'' said attorney <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON>, who had asked for $ 25 million for <ORGANIZATION> Estridge </ORGANIZATION> and $ 5 million for his wife. `` I was a little disappointed with the numbers.'' But <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>, one of three daughters who filed the suit, said they were happy with the judgment and the end of the case. `` We do n't think anything could have happened any better and we're definitely relieved it's over,'' she said. `` It does n't make it better, but it helps us to live with it.'' <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON> said the sum awarded Monday was a record for compensatory damages in a wrongful-death suit. The breakdown was $ 6.25 million for <PERSON> Estridge </PERSON>'s loss of earnings, $ 750,000 for loss of enjoyment of life and $ 100,000 for mental anguish. For Mrs. <PERSON> Estridge </PERSON>, the jury awarded $ 750,000 for loss of enjoyment of life and $ 100,000 for mental anguish. Shortly before <PERSON> Estridge </PERSON> died, the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, native was named overseer of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide manufacturing operations, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, at a salary of $ 240,000 yearly. Although the trial was held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the award was reached under the law of <PERSON> Estridge </PERSON>'s new home state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to allow for the salary projection figures, <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabetta </PERSON> declined to comment on the award, but told Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprizzo </PERSON> he would appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> referred all calls to the company's insurance carrier, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION>, and had no comment. The Estridge verdict came on the same day of opening arguments in another suit stemming from the fatal crash. A wrongful-death suit on behalf of <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarnt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, opened Monday with a 12-minute videotape highlighting her 15 years of life. The first half of the tape was made from silent home movies. It showed her as a newborn first coming home and as a toddler celebrating birthdays and Christmas.

 In the stock market, the names, numbers and skills of the players change but the game remains about the same no matter how many times we are told that `` it's a whole new ball game.'' Never was that advice more freely offered, more uncritically accepted and more avariciously followed than in the stock market of 1987, which crashed to reality on Oct. 19. It is, by popular agreement, the BIG lesson emerging bit by bit as the event recedes into history, and as once giddy and greedy minds resume more sober interpretations of the economy. The various studies under way or completed seem to emphasize such factors as `` portfolio insurance'' and futures trading and other technical factors that arose over the past decade and seemingly changed the market's makeup. No doubt, such factors could have contributed, but it is now patently clear they could n't have done so without the presence of the same old psychological undercurrent that boosted stock prices beyond reason. The omens were there to absorb or ignore: Shares sold at 22 times earnings, vs. a long-time norm under 15. They were priced at 2 -LCB- to 3 times a company's liquidation value, a full point above the long-term norm. Dividend yields were half what they should have been. Critics with a classic education in the ways of the stock market pointed to these lessons, and more, and were scorned as old-fashioned. Who were they to argue with sophisticated electronic computations? Do computers lie? The oldtimers' admonitions have left an eerie echo, a painful one, somewhat akin to parental warnings that were ignored because, every child knows, parents issue warnings to children because that's what parents are supposed to do. Looking back, some of the market's smartest investors, including big-name portfolio managers for mutual funds, insurers and the like, wonder how they got drawn into a market they knew was headed for a fall. They knew, but apparently could n't resist the temptation of what they thought was easy money, just as others before them fell because they were governed by emotions peculiar to the human species. It is still a debate with some of them as they review the crash. They knew the old rules still applied. They knew the market was destined to correct its imbalance _ that is, fall. They knew the rules of the game had n't changed. But, they ask, was it reason or emotion that governed their decision to jump in? Was it unreasonable to assume that a market propelled ever higher, no matter how irrationally, offered an opportunity to make a quick buck? Was it reasonable or foolish to ignore the stories of quick profits by your brother-in-law and not be tempted to do the same? Or, for a fund manager, was it foolhardy or sensible to try keeping pace with dice-throwing competitors? You can blame the crash on new trading techniques, the acceleration of trading activity by means of computers, and the instantaneous communications that seem to exaggerate advances and declines. Something might be done eventually to mute the adverse effects of these factors, but judging from the evidence of last fall there is little that can be done with the players themselves. The names and numbers change, and some of the techniques, too, but the game will always be played by human beings, and they can be expected to act no differently.

After the meeting, Firestone Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> met briefly with reporters and discussed <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s talks with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> Firestone and <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> had planned a 75 percent joint venture until <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> made its unsolicited, $ 58-a-share bid for all of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s 32 million outstanding shares. <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said he told both <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> in negotiations that <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> was holding talks with a third firm that he declined to identify. <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> was able to make its tender offer quickly because of its prior knowledge of Firestone. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> purchased a plant from Firestone in 1983. `` I do n't want to speculate on what <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> would have done under other circumstances. But I think all of the background that <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> had acquired in discussions with us earlier certainly made it much more possible for <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> to move quickly in a two-week period,'' said <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>. `` I think that had we announced in mid-February that the board of directors had decided to enter into a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> rather than <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, I think it was improbable that <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> then would have made an unsolicited tender offer ... This was by no means an unfriendly action on <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>'s part,'' <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said.

 Stocks were mixed today in another slow trading session that brokers attributed to underlying investor reluctance to participate because of post-crash uncertainty. `` We're right on the top of the fence and do n't know which way we're going to fall,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, confined to a narrow range through most of the session, was up 3.15 points to 2,070.29 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all listed issues rose 0.25 to 151.72 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s market value index rose 0.75 to 298.93. Gaining issues narrowly led declines on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 768 up, 648 down and 511 unchanged. Volume totaled a sluggish 97.84 million shares with two hours of business left. Stocks were helped somewhat by a surprising drop in factory orders for durable goods in February. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggested to some strategists that the economy is n't as strong as previously believed, thereby raising the possibility that interest rates wo n't creep up. Some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers, reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past several weeks. Nevertheless, stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed that many investors remain reluctant to re-enter the market in the aftermath of the October crash. `` People still are wounded,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Those wounds have not scarred over yet.

 Share prices closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with many stocks depressed by continued thin trading in the opening days of an extended trading account period. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 5.7 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,835.4 at the close, its worst level for the day. Volume was barely changed at 357.1 million shares, compared with 357.3 million on Monday. Shares opened lower following a sharp decline on Wall Street on Monday, and an attempted rally in mid-morning quickly ran out of steam. A feeble opening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday further dampened sentiment in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> afternoon trading. Dealers said there was little institutional business as many investors kept to the sidelines in the early days of the extended trading account, which runs for three weeks instead of the usual two to include the Easter holiday weekend. The account began last Friday afternoon. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> exchange divides trading into either two-week or three-week periods for accounting purposes. Trades generally must be completed within 10 days of a period ending.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said Monday it will accept two rulings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by lowering protectionist barriers on wine and liquor and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> fish processing. Trade Minister <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> that Canadians would be `` exposed to the law of the jungle'' in world commerce if the government did not support the rulings, scheduled for ratification Tuesday by the full council of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had the option of fighting or ignoring the rulings by the 95-nation <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which sets international trade rules and adjudicates disputes between members. But that course could have led to retaliation, such as duties on Canadian goods. A preliminary <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> ruling last fall said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s province-by-province system of marketing alcoholic beverages unfairly favors domestic wine, beer and liquor
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel was assessing a longstanding complaint against Canadian liquor boards by the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to sell more wine and brandy in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will open borders to more foreign wine and liquor, as the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> asked, but protection will continue for the $ 3.4 billion Canadian beer industry. Canadian wines, mostly of low quality, have a 45 percent share of the domestic market because of a government policy limiting imports. <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> puts a 66 percent surcharge on foreign wines. The Europeans do not plan large-scale beer exports, although beer was included in their complaint. But if <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> dropped its import barriers for beer, the path would be cleared for the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breweries to swamp the Canadian market. At present, Canadian provinces only permit the sale of beer brewed within each province by the nation's 40 breweries, with a few foreign imports. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beers are brewed in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> under license. The <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> warned last week that 19,000 Canadian jobs would be lost if the American beer companies moved in. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said the government is reviewing a petition by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 33 wineries to launch a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> challenge to the heavy subsidies enjoyed by European Economic Community vineyards In the meantime, the government will consider adjustment programs for Canadian wine growers and winemakers, she said.

 On West Coast fish, the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> preliminary ruling condemned <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for curbs on the export of raw salmon and herring. The fish is currently processed in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> before shipment, raising its price and discriminating against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fish processing companies. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said the government would accept the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> ruling but will introduce new measures to force Canadian fishermen to land their catch in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Some are now selling salmon or herring off their boats to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fish companies.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended slightly higher against most major foreign currencies in European trading Tuesday. Gold prices fell. Most of the day's activity occurred in cross trades that did not involve the dollar. The pound and the yen gained against the West German mark, while the French franc steadied against the mark on expectations that President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> would announce that he will run in next month's election. With attention focused elsewhere, `` nobody is too sure what to do with the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dipple </PERSON>, chief trader at <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exterieur </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Dealers said the yen remains strong because of expectations that Japanese financial institutions will buy the currency at the end of the Japanese fiscal year. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar closed at 127.07 yen, down 1.28 yen from last Friday. The Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted higher at 127.10 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8300 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.8285 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.6935 West German marks, up from 1.6880; 1.4015 Swiss francs, up from 1.3970; 5.7540 French francs, up from 5.7380; 1.9015 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8970; 1,253.25 Italian lire, up from 1,249.25, and 1.2468 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2494. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 448.75 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 449.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold also was lower, closing at a bid $ 448.50 down from $ 450.50 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.61 an ounce to close at a bid $ 451.87. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.46 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $ 6.47.

 Wheat and soybean futures prices ended higher while corn futures slipped slightly Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The November-delivery contract for soybeans rose 7 cents to a contract high of $ 6.66 a bushel.

 Stocks ended mixed today in extremely light trading that brokers blamed on widespread investor apathy, despite another rash of takeover-related buying that boosted the value of some issues. `` There is absolutely no interest in the broad section of stocks with the exception of takeover targets,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldowney </PERSON>, manager of equity and over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stringfellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

The Searle IUD remains on the government approved list, but the company stopped selling it in 1986, citing growing costs from court suits. The company faces about 500 suits by women who claim that the Copper-7 caused them to develop pelvic infections. The company has won 14 of the 17 suits that have gone to trial and maintains that the device was, and is, safe.

Currency dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range in lackluster activity. `` There was a lot of activity but no results _ the dollar did n't go anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. As the dollar languished, investors turned to other currencies, namely the Japanese yen `` People seem to be buying yen against mostly anything else these days,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvello </PERSON>, a foreign-exchange trader with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

In European dealings, the dollar finished slightly higher against most major currencies, but most of the day's activity occurred in trades in other currencies. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar closed at 127.07 yen, down 1.28 yen from last Friday.

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Breakup Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ailing <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> might have to be split into pieces to make <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest bank-holding company more attractive to investors, experts said. First RepublicBank, weakened by a run on deposits and multimillion-dollar losses, received a $ 1 billion injection of capital from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last week. But because it could take as much as $ 5 billion to rescue the nation's 13th-largest bank holding company, banking regulators are considering breaking up the holding company as a marketing alternative. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, `` that certainly is an option.'' The holding company's banks in major markets could be packaged together or in regional or in statewide combinations, experts said. `` The first thing you think of is splitting the company into bite-size morsels,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, a former director of supervision at the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> who is a consultant at <ORGANIZATION> Bracewell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law firm. `` It's a very large bank for someone else to acquire,'' said <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarchs </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I do n't see anyone on the scene that's willing to do that.'' First Republic reported a 1987 loss of $ 656.8 million, $ 3.92 billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than $ 2 billion this year. Assets total about $ 33.2 billion. The bank holding company, however, is in the process of consolidating some of its banks, which could make a breakup more difficult. Those moves already have cut the number of banks from 103 to 73, and plans are to continue mergings until only 40 remain. The holding company has banks in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Although the breakup of the holding company could make it more accessible to investors, some argue it would be better if the company remained intact. `` These banks are intertwined, having common management, borrowers and computer systems,'' <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said. `` Breaking off chunks presents some tough administrative problems.''

 The stock market languished Tuesday and finished narrowly mixed, reflecting what brokers called widespread investor apathy despite another rash of takeover-related buying that boosted some issues. Economic uncertainty and resilient anxiety about the market's condition five months after the October crash generally were blamed for another slow trading day `` There is absolutely no interest in the broad section of stocks with the exception of takeover targets,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldowney </PERSON>, manager of equity and over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stringfellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I think that overall, there is a belief that maybe this thing's not over and people are just taking a wait-and-see attitude.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 20.23 points Monday in the slowest trading of the year, vacillated in a tight range and ended down 0.99 point to 2,066.15. Most broader market indicators rose marginally. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> totaled 142.0 million shares, slightly more than the 1987 low of 128.83 million shares traded Monday. In another similarity to the previous session, the stock market mirrored the behavior of the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy's health. Bond prices finished barely changed, reflecting uncertainty over whether interest rates will rise, drop or stabilize. `` We're right on the top of the fence and do n't know which way we're going to fall,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's very slow. The only thing good is that when the market's down, volume dries up. That indicates there's not much selling.'' The number of advancing stocks narrowly outnumbered declines in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 765 up, 736 down and 481 unchanged. As with the previous session, the big winners were rumored and actual takeover targets, led by <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which jumped 14 -LCB- to 46 -RCB- in heavy trading after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 45 a share for the supermarket company. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 | to 57 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 -RRB- to 69 \ after Canadian developer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> raised its offer for the retailer Other prominent speculative takeover-related stocks included <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- to 45 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- to 36.

<HEAD>Platinum Sugres for Second Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Platinum future prices surged a second straight day Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as a `` whiff of inflation'' and uneasiness about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> rippled through the markets. Platinum broke through a barrier at $ 510 a troy ounce, climbing $ 7.70 to $ 8.30 higher with the contract for March delivery settling at $ 510.40. On other markets, petroleum futures prices finished mostly higher in volatile trading; wheat and soybean futures prices were higher, but corn slipped slightly; and livestock and meat futures prices were higher across the board. `` Platinum is a good indicator of inflationary sentiment, because it's a precious metal and an industrial metal,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's a hedge, but it's also affected by fundamentals. `` Some of -LRB- Tuesday's -RRB- rise is the whiff of inflation some traders are picking up on. But you can discount $ 3 or $ 4 of the $ 7 -LRB- advance -RRB- to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` We're beginning to seem some political unrest and that makes people nervous.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> provides nearly all of the West's platinum, which has industrial applications as varied as X-ray scanning equipment and catalytic converters for autos. A nationwide strike Monday marking the 28th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massacre </LOCATION> was honored by as many as 90 percent of the workers in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. Similar protests were staged elsewhere despite increasingly tough government measures. Gold did not join the runup, finishing 50 cents to $ 1.60 cents lower with March at $ 448.70 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; silver was 1.5 cents to 1.8 cents higher, with March at 646.5 cents a troy ounce. Petroleum futures finished mixed after another volatile day <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Reports that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> would _ and then would not _ hold a news conference to unveil price-stabilizing measures brought wild swings Monday. The same reports pressured Tuesday's opening and may have sparked a surge at the close. `` The same things that played havoc yesterday was responsible for today's games as well,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, energy futures analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 40 cents lower to 11 cents higher, with April at $ 16.09 per 42-gallon barrel; heating oil was 30 cents to 95 cents higher, with April at 46.26 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 21 cents to 47 cents higher, with April at 46.32 cents a gallon. After Tuesday's close of business, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly distillate report was generally construed as slightly bearish for crude. Support for wheat and soybeans at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> came soon after the open when Monday's big player, C & amp; D Commodities, began buying again. C & amp; D's buying did n't match Monday's levels _ the Chicago-based house bought 20 million bushels of beans the previous day, compared to just 4 million Tuesday. But it did helped trigger buying that pushed the November contract for soybeans up 7 cents to equal a contract high at $ 6.66 a bushel. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 2.99 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower, with March at $ 2.00 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cent lower to 5 cents higher, with March at $ 1.95 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents to 8 \ cents higher, with March at $ 6.32 a bushel A strong move toward frozen pork bellies helped both the livestock and pork complexes advance at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .73 cent higher, with April at 74.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .25 cent to .50 cent higher, with March at at 82.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to 1.38 cents higher, with April at 46.57 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .23 cent to 1.45 cents higher, with March at 55.45 cents a pound. Stock-index futures climbed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> 500 index settled .05 point higher at 270.65. The underlying spot index advanced .10 point. closing at 268.84.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> charged Tuesday that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for tough trade legislation is just `` a political ploy'' that will end after the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses are over. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, said his position on trade has been consistent, and his staff released quotations from last year indicating his support for major provisions of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trade bill. `` Who is for a tough trade policy? Who is going to be for a tough trade policy after <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> asked in a telephone interview Tuesday. `` The answer is, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is and will be. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has n't been, is n't and wo n't be.'' `` When he is on the East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, he wants to talk about free trade. When he's in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, he does n't,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s tough trade legislation, now in a conference committee on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, has been the capstone of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman's platform. Monday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsed trade legislation sponsored by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, who in turn endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> quickly accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of having a `` battlefield conversion'' on trade, saying the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> bill was the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> legislation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are tied for the lead in the polls on Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a distant third. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say that may be the reason for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s attacks. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> stepped up the attack, questioning the sincerity of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for such legislation. `` I think he remains against it. I think it is a political ploy,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` By what he has done, he is trying to have it both ways. ... Now that he is in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and we are five days out from the caucuses, he wants to fool the people of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> late Monday that his position has n't changed `` He has been a strong opponent of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> bill from the begining, but has always been an advocate of leveling the -LRB- trade -RRB- playing field,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff on Tuesday pointed to quotes from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor last year in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. On July 11, 1987, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I think the trade bill which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved yesterday says if there is a consistent pattern of unfair trade practices ... there I think we have to do something.'' `` I feel a lot better about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill'' than the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> trade legislation, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on Aug. 4, 1987. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has said in the past you do n't need new legislation. ... He has been profoundly negative about everything I have said about trade.'' The congressman, too, provided quotes from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last year _ quotes he said back up his charge of a flip-flop. `` The president today has all the authority he needs to do something about those unfair trade practices. We do not need more laws or more amendments,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at the Aug. 8 debate at <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aides. In debates in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, `` You want a law. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, I want to act.'' And earlier this year in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aides said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` We do not need more legislation.'' The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amemdment and the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> bill do differ, but both try to strengthen potential retaliation against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners for unfair practices. In general, the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> bill would target specific industries in foreign countries which engage in unfair practices. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment would trigger retaliation against another country for running a big surplus with this country in part through unfair practices. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has always felt the president has had the authority to act. The <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> amendment ... gives the president a better way to get there, but he can pretty much get there on his own now,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Loss of $15.2 Million For Fourth Quarter Of '87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a once-mighty industrial giant that filed for bankruptcy reorganization last June, Tuesday reported a net loss of $ 15.2 million, or $ 1.17 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1987. The loss, on sales of $ 109.3 million, compared with a loss of $ 5.8 million, or 52 cents per share, for the same period of 1986 when sales totaled $ 116.8 million. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> reported a total loss of $ 29.3 million compared with a loss of $ 8.6 million in 1986. Sales in 1987 declined to $ 410 million from $ 510.3 million in 1986. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueche </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the results reflected obligations from years before the company scaled down by selling off many of its businesses. Once a major producer of farm machinery, the company later diversified into production of a wide range of other equipment. <PERSON> Bueche </PERSON> said the cost of health care benefits for retired employees was disproportionate to the company's size, althoughthe company has implemented a strategy aimed at reducing that expense.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Fall In February, But Economists Unconcerned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Economists stuck by their optimistic predictions for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing on Tuesday in spite of a government report that orders to American factories for `` big-ticket'' durable goods fell 1.8 percent in February. In other news, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 0.99 point to 2,066.15; the dollar was mixed against other major currencies; and bond prices were little changed in light trading. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable goods _ items expected to last three or more years _ totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 111.4 billion in February, following an identical 1.8 percent January decline. It was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable goods orders have fallen for two consecutive months. Economists maintained that manufacturing companies still were enjoying good business because the weaker dollar has boosted export demand. `` What we have is a two-month hesitation after some big increases,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Still, analysts said the back-to-back declines showed businesses were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in an effort to get control of bulging inventories. Inventories swelled at the end of 1987 while consumer demand fell. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that while new orders fell in February, the total backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.7 percent to $ 397.1 billion, the 12th consecutive monthly increase. `` This backlog suggests that factories can keep humming along for a while even though new orders dropped,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Fortune 44 Co. of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> is getting out of the fortune cookie business, saying the slow market for the cookies could spell problems for the company's future. Company officials announced the decision on Monday, citing continuing losses and sales which have not met expectations. Fortune 44 believes the lack of sales are due to the limited market, the infrequent purchase cycle and intense competition in the low-price end of the fortune cookie market, officials said in a written statement. `` When's the last time you bought fortune cookies?'' said the company's controller, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>. `` We're in the grocery store business where things have to turn. People buy fortune cookies but mostly for a special occasion.'' The company will service existing customers through May, she said. Started in 1983, Fortune 44 employs eight people and offers 20 different varieties of the cookies, including its Wish Biscuits and Lucky Chan lines. Company officials said they have received inquiries from competitors interested in acquiring its lines and said Fortune 44 is pursuing those inquiries. Management also is seeking an acquisition or merger candidate and is having ongoing discussions with two companies, the statement said. The company is optimistic it can find a merger or acquisition that can benefit shareholders, officials said. Fortune 44 reported assets totaling nearly $ 1.2 million last September; it has 110 shareholders.

<TEXT>
 A department store chain's attempt to avoid paying taxes for merchandise catalogs received by its <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> customers sparked skeptical questioning Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, representing New Orleans-based <ORGANIZATION> D.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, seemed to be having little success in arguing that his client should not have to pay a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> `` use tax'' on the catalogs' value <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON> spent nearly 30 minutes responding to the justices' questions By contrast, <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> concluded his presentation for state tax officials in less than 10 minutes because he was asked so few questions. The court's decision is expected by July. <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, contended that no tax should be assessed because the catalogs are published in other states and mailed directly to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> residents. The state imposes a tax on all tangible personal property bought or used within <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON> argued that the department store chain actually had paid for a service _ delivery of the catalogs _ and not for goods, several justices seemed to disagree. `` <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> put this whole operation into creation,'' said Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> questioned whether delivery of the catalogs, even through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail, is `` an activity that can be taxed.'' She later seemed to answer her own question in the affirmative: `` <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> caused the distribution in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. It ordered it. It paid for it.'' When <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON> contended that it is <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' customers, not <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who use the catalogs, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> responded, `` <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> is having that use provided.'' When Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> asked, `` Could <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> have made a dollar in the state of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> without the catalogs?'' <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON> said many of the customers who frequent <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' 13 stores in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> did so long before catalogs were mailed out. `` Those are pretty old people,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> quipped. <PERSON> Rinker </PERSON> acknowledged that the department store chain could be subjected to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> tax if the catalogs are delivered to the state and distributed from there. But he said the current set-up precludes state tax liability. <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> argued that the real taxable activity undertaken by <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> is `` maintaing a market in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> for their sales.'' <ORGANIZATION> D.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also operates stores in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> but 82 percent of its catalogs are mailed to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> residents. The state tax imposed on <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> is based on 82 percent of the catalogs' value, and the validity of applying the tax to the catalogs was upheld by state courts. The case is <ORGANIZATION> D.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, 87-267.

 Eight states on Tuesday filed suit accusing dozens of insurance companies of conspiring to create the liability insurance crisis, making coverage unavailable or too costly for many governments and businesses. The companies' actions were `` a major contributor to the insurance crisis that forced so many cities and businesses up against the wall,'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It was the public and the consumer who paid the price for this collusive exercise in corporate greed,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostwald </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,400-member rate and policy advisory organization named in the lawsuits, called the claims unfounded and denied the existence of a conspiracy. The lawsuits filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here by seven states accuses major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British insurance firms, reinsurers and <PERSON> Ostwald </PERSON>'s trade group of using secret agreements and internal pressure several years ago in an effort to eliminate the most common type of general liability policy, that covering any damage that occurs during the policy term regardless of when the damage is discovered. Reinsurers provide vital backup coverage for other insurers, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said. The attorneys general of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> filed similar suits in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, naming 32 insurance companies, underwriters and associations. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> would sue in the same court Wednesday. A separate lawsuit was filed in state court in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` These defendants have sucked the blood of our nation's economic well-being,'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said at a news conference <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> filed suit in state court because the state `` has one of the toughest, best antitrust laws in the nation,'' he said. As a result of the conspiracy, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s suit said, property damage insurance for local governments, non-profit agencies such as child care centers, and various businesses suddenly became unavailable or prohibitively expensive. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and elsewhere, local governments cut back or eliminated services, such as parks and police, because of insurance expenses, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said. Many local government officials blamed rising damage awards in injury suits and joined the insurance industry in efforts to restrict the right to sue. The lawsuits claim the companies targeted for elimination coverage for spills and other types of pollution incidents and general liability for damage discovered after the life of a policy, known as `` occurrence'' coverage. The companies instead favored more limited policies, covering only losses that were suffered and claimed within the policy term, excluding damage that was discovered later, the suits said. The lawsuits said four major insurance companies _ <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> _ started a campaign in 1984 to curtail coverage that was generally available in the industry. According to the suits, the companies got major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British reinsurers, including underwriters at <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, to threaten a boycott of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance company that provided the broader coverage. Among other things, the plaintiffs seek to restructure the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> by giving non-insurers a majority on its board and making public its data on insurance coverage losses. <PERSON> Ostwald </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that pollution insurance and `` occurrence'' coverage remained available, with some restrictions. Pollution coverage was changed in response to expansive court decisions, he said. `` It's simply incorrect to assert that an attempt was made to impose this policy on the marketplace,'' he said, referring to the alleged effort to scrap `` occurrence'' coverage. Insurance rates increased mainly because of `` a demonstrable increase in claims losses and a drop in interest rates, slowing down -LRB- insurers' -RRB- investment income,'' he said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a defendant in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, termed the action `` another political move by political officeholders who have consistently opposed any and all efforts to address the real problems of the nation's liability system.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, also named in both lawsuits, said, `` It's really an ingrained condition of how we operate in all our jurisdictions that we conform to whatever antitrust regulations exist. We do not violate laws.'' In addtion to <ORGANIZATION> ISO </ORGANIZATION>, the suit in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> named eight companies that served on the <ORGANIZATION> ISO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee: <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION>, Fireman's <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Also named in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were the <ORGANIZATION> Reinsurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and reinsurers <PERSON> Merrett </PERSON> Non-Marine Syndicate No 799 and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Merrett </PERSON> is part of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is its underwriter.
