 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is halfway through picking his Cabinet with the selection of former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary and he now is focusing on candidates to run the government's housing, health and transportation agencies. Trying to wrap up major appointments before Christmas, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to announce at least three more Cabinet choices early next week. These will include conservative Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as secretary of housing and urban development and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass-transit official <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as secretary of transportation, sources involved in the transition said Friday. They also said health educator <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> continues to be the leading candidate for secretary of health and human services but had not been offered the job. If chosen, he would be the first black in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Moreover, former Republican Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was said by sources to be a leading candidate to become Energy Secretary. Sources also reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had chosen <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> and former Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> -LRB- Lud -RRB- <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to be his appointees to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is charged with recommending ways to reduce the federal deficit. <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> is a former senator who once served as ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> has been a friend of the president-elect since their days together at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. In naming Tower to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he was `` totally satisfied'' with <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s fitness to serve after a detailed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check into his connections with the defense industry as well as with allegations of womanizing and drinking problems. Tower, commenting on the allegations, said `` I got up every morning and laughed myself silly over what I was reading in the newspapers.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, predicting the selection would be greeted with `` wide support abroad and at home,'' said he believed Tower had been strengthened by the ordeal. He said the exhaustive investigation into Tower's professional and personal life had yielded a `` clean bill of health.'' After announcing the choice of Tower, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fielded questions from reporters. He said that `` there is no expectation that we will or wo n't'' have a summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next year. He said he did n't want to signal unwillingness to build on recent progress in U.S.-Soviet relations, but also did n't want to `` send out the other signal'' of acting too hastily. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he `` would n't overstate the importance'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that opened Friday in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. He stressed that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has embarked on a dialogue and not a negotiation. Tower was the seventh Cabinet member named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, leaving seven slots still unfilled. Tower said that in running the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, he would have to produce `` as much if not more defense for less money.'' Tower hinted at manpower reductions throughout the armed services. But, he stressed, `` I would not advocate, for the immediate future, any significant troop reduction in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The appointment completes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of a national security team. He previously named former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, chose retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> as national security adviser and said he would retain <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Tower has held a variety of sensitive posts since retiring from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, including stints as an arms control negotiator for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and as head of a review board, popularly known as the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, appointed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to probe the Iran-Contra affair. Some conservative critics have contended that Tower's support for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan for a land and space-based shield against missiles has been lukewarm. Tower told reporters that `` I do n't have any reservations'' about the Strategic Defense Initiative. However, he added, `` I understand the value of SDI, not just as a deterrent potential but also as a very, very valuable negotiating tool.'' Asked if that meant he thought of it only as a bargaining chip for arms-reduction talks, he responded, `` Not a chip, leverage, negotiating leverage.'' In another development, a transition source said campaign strategist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, who is serving as co-chairman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team, has ended many days of deliberation and decided to go to the White House as deputy chief of staff

<HEAD>Vietnam Veteran to Lead Prosecution At North Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war veteran has been selected as lead trial prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case against fellow former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and ex-White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, 44, who like <PERSON> North </PERSON> was wounded while leading a Marine infantry platoon in action, was chosen on Friday by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to head a three-lawyer team that will try North. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had said he would like to try the North case himself. But he said in a statement Friday that he would continue to deal with problems posed by a wealth of classified documents and supervise the continuing investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s war record, which was not mentioned in the statement, was coincidental to his being named head of the prosecution team. But <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s Purple Heart for his combat wound is a serendipitous qualification for the lead prosecutor in the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who has made patriotism and his own <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> service a hallmark of his public defense since the Iran-Contra affair unfolded two years ago. North, 44, who earned two Purple Hearts for combat wounds, wore his Marine uniform when he testified before the congressional committees that investigated the arms-for-hostages deals. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> announced his courtroom team in advance of a hearing next Wednesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to begin final preparations for North's trial, which could begin as early as late January. The former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> as a lieutenant colonel following his indictment last March, is accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms deals to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, who is on leave from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> law firm, will be joined by associate independent counsels <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zornow </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>, 34, both former federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zornow </PERSON> investigated and helped try several major municipal corruption cases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This commits three of our most experienced criminal lawyers to the case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> repeatedly had expressed an interest in trying the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s decision to order separate trials for each of the defendants and the continuing complications of classified documents and congressional immunity given <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> forced a re-examination of those plans, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Besides the original grand jury that indicted <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his co-defendants, a new panel began meeting this fall to consider possible perjury by participants in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> must be free to oversee the investigations and negotiate with intelligence agencies about disclosing classified information that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> says must be included in the proof against North. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mixter </PERSON>, who has been handling the prosecution's case during closed proceedings on secret documents in the North case, was named a member of the team of lawyers for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> upon graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 and was commissioned a second lieutenant. Sent to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1966, he was wounded while leading an infantry platoon near the Demilitarized Zone. He left the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and studied law at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He later served as law clerk to retired <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>.

<HEAD>LaRouche Says Conviction is `Obscene Miscarriage of Justice'</HEAD>

 Political maverick <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says his conviction of tax and mail fraud conspiracy is `` a wrong, gross, disgusting, obscene miscarriage of justice,'' and predicted he will die a martyr's death if sent to prison. `` They do n't want a living political martyr in prison, they want a dead one,'' said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, claiming he was the victim of a hate campaign by the news media and a frameup by a pro-Soviet `` friends of glasnost'' clique in the Justice and State departments. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, 66, a perennial fringe candidate for president, told reporters he felt no remorse or sympathy for his followers, many of them elderly people, who had loaned his organization millions of dollars and gotten little or none of their money back. `` They have been wronged, not by us but by the government,'' he said, explaining that when several of his groups were forced into bankruptcy proceedings in April 1987, the government seized loan repayment funds. After less than 12 hours of deliberation, a federal trial jury on Friday found <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy for raising more than $ 30 million in loans from supporters without any intention of repaying them. In addition, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was convicted of scheming to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by having all his personal expenses paid by various corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable income. Government prosecutors said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has not filed federal income tax returns for any year since 1978. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> set sentencing for Jan. 27, and allowed all seven defendants to remain free on their personal recognizance. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $ 3.25 million. All seven were found guilty of all 48 counts contained in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Oct. 14 after a two-year investigation of the LaRouche organization's financial affairs. The six convicted <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> associates, who face lesser maximum penalties, are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, the leader's chief fund-raiser; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>, legal coordinator for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, and fund-raisers <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>. Defense lawyers said they planned to appeal the convictions. They repeatedly denied that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> had sought to cheat federal tax collectors, and insisted that his fund-raisers had promised in good faith that the terms of the loans would be honored. Government prosecutors led by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the LaRouche people were lying when they solicited the loans with promises of prompt payment at preferred interest rates. In 1986, they said, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> associates were making an estimated $ 500,000 in improvements to his heavily guarded <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, estate, including a swimming pool and riding ring, while they were defaulting on millions of dollars in loans from supporters. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who did not testify during the four-week trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, stood erect facing the jury of eight women and four men as a clerk recited their guilty verdict on all 13 counts against him. He sat down without a word or a gesture. Small nodded and smiled almost imperceptibly as he was convicted. Ms. <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> broke into tears and fell into the arms of a woman friend after she left the courtroom. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said he did not regard the outcome of the complex, hard-fought court case as a victory. `` I consider this an obvious conclusion to a long pattern of false statements to trusting senior citizens,'' he said. `` Their dreams for their retirement are gone. It's a sad case.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Kenly </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>, said the jury's decision probably was influenced by `` the size of the debt incurred and the failure to pay that debt back according to the terms and conditions.'' The jurors `` probably felt it would be a long time before they would be paid back, if at all,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. He speculated that the jury also was influenced by the `` very controversial views'' held by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his supporters on political issues, which seemed `` inextricably entwined'' with the defaulted loans issue. The LaRouche movement embraces numerous unorthodox positions and relies heavily on conspiratorial theories to explain world events. Some adherents have advocated quarantining AIDS victims. Others have alleged that former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> are involved in conspiracies At a news conference held in his <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> apartment suite shortly after the verdict was announced, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> said he himself was the victim of a conspiracy conceived by leftist government opponents, promoted by liberal dupes in the news media and carried to a climax Friday by `` a runaway jury ... with no regard for facts.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> said he was convinced that his conviction is tantamount to a death sentence at the hands of fellow prison inmates. `` The way the jury voted, I'm dead,'' he said, adding that the government's goal was `` not to put me in prison but to kill me.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> said he will leave behind the legacy of an international `` anti-Bolshevik resistance'' led by followers who are `` prepared to fight and die to save civilization'' from world conquest by the communists. `` We will kill and die if necessary to restore the kind of government the founders of this country fought to create,'' he said. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> said he and his followers are not afraid to die. `` We are not a bunch of sentimental slush heads,'' he said. A separate criminal case involving <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is scheduled for retrial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> starting Feb. 27. In that case, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five of his organizations are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that more than $ 2 million was raised for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign through credit card and loan fraud.

<HEAD>Tower Backed Defense Buildup, Has Been Defense Consultant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has turned for his defense secretary to a former senator who strongly backed the military buildup of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and worked as a consultant for major military contractors after leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, a 63-year-old Texan, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after 24 years including a stint as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. After leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Tower went into business as a defense consultant. He also has served as an arms negotiator for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and he headed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s Iran-Contra investigative panel. He was widely mentioned as a candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job _ by most accounts the only one he really wanted _ under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never made the move. Tower comes to the job now at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> faces acute budget pressures because of the federal budget deficit and the array of costly new weapons systems developed as part of the military buildup. `` The bottom line is that we must provide at least as much, if not more, defense for less money,'' <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his nomination Friday. The announcement followed a lengthy background check that brought a public airing of Tower's private life, including an acrimonious divorce, talk of drinking and womanizing, and questions about the propriety of naming someone to the job who had worked with so many defense companies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed `` a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless'' and said, `` I am totally satisfied in that regard.'' The president-elect apparently decided that Tower's extensive financial ties to weapons companies that he will do business with as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary was not a bar to service. Asked if Tower would stay out of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> matters involving corporations for whom he has consulted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I expect so, but I do n't know. I expect he would, just like anybody coming in. ... I think we'll bend over backward in that regard.'' According to public records and associates, Tower's consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> has been on annual retainer with the following defense contractors: <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and British Aerospace. In addition, Tower's firm received about $ 100,000 a year under a contract for consulting services to <ORGANIZATION> Hicks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, Va.-based aerospace consulting firm headed by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of defense. Through <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>' firm, Tower indirectly provided advice to still more defense contractors. Tower's firm received $ 96,000 a year from <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>. Although other fees were not revealed, an associate, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON>, acknowledged some were in the range of $ 100,000 a year. `` There are some retainers in the neighborhood of that figure, and others that are substantially less,'' <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON> said. Tower also received income from speeches _ about $ 15,000 each for the 30 or so a year he gives, according to his agent <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. He has a second consulting firm, Dallas-based Tower, <ORGANIZATION> Eggers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, which is described as providing financial services and advice. Tower was a former board member of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank, <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. With his <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> firm, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> was part of a group that unsuccessfully bid to buy the financially troubled bank before it was taken over by North Carolina-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Billmire </PERSON> described Tower's work for the defense contractors as providing advice on the direction of future defense projects and advice and information on government budget processes, including the transfer of money among projects <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said he signed a contract for Tower's services in order to gain the benefit of his advice and opinions about what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was likely to do on defense issues. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Tower was a supporter of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative and the MX missile. But he was said to be angered by the administration's failure to agree on a missile deployment plan and he moved to block development until an acceptable plan was found. Tower left the arms negotiating post after 14 months, and in late 1986 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named him to head his Iran-Contra investigative panel. Its report laid part of the blame for affair on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s management style _ but had little to say about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s involvement. In naming Tower, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was bringing a fellow Texan to the upper levels of his administration. Tower was the first Republican elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since Reconstruction. He is a native of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and was a college professor before running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He was elected in 1961 in a special election to fill <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s seat, after <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> became vice president.

 As a former senator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> will receive a certain deference at his confirmation hearing as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new defense chief. But he may also face serious questioning about his willingness to shoehorn <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending into a newly limited budget. `` I would say John Tower will be accorded special respect, but no special privilege,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> told reporters he had consulted with committee chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and that hearings on Tower's nomination would probably take place the week of Jan. 20 He said while Tower would undergo careful questioning, he ultimately will be confirmed. `` The day after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirms him he'll move into harness and step out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He'll require no on-the-job training.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, in a statement, said the confirmation hearings would focus on Tower's plans for meeting defense challenges over the next four years, including who will be appointed to senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> jobs, how congressionally mandated reforms will be put in place and how security will be maintained in a time of tight budgets. Some of those who will sit in judgment on Tower when he goes before the committee were there when Tower chaired the panel during the first four years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` It will be a love feast,'' predicted <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, a former top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official now at the Center for Security Policy, a conservative <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research organization. `` He's tough, he's shrewd, he's smart,'' said one of those former colleagues, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, R-N.H. `` He's not likely to be hoodwinked by the Soviets. He is certainly well prepared in terms of expertise and experience.'' One issue likely to emerge during the confirmation hearings is how the nomination of <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary who is a central figure in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, got past Tower when he chaired the committee. Tower has said his panel never was given access to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background report on <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> that contained damaging allegations and might have kept <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> from getting the senior job. Committee member Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., has asked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to explain why those allegations never surfaced in 1981, when <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was nominated The long <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check on Tower, and talk about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reported desire to put a strong manager in as Tower's second-in-command, have weakened the new nominee, said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>. She said that will make him more open to attack for coziness with the `` You have a new secretary who never saw a weapons system he did n't like,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters. `` He is tainted in being able to run a tough, aggressive Pentagon.'' `` Over his career this is not somebody who has staked out a reputation as a tough, budget-cutting, six gun-toting decision maker,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, defense director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent analysis group. `` In the early 1980s, -LRB- while chairman of the committee -RRB- he signed off on the biggest peacetime buildup in defense since the end of World War II. He defended it, he pushed it through,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` The mission today is very different,'' he said. `` It's how do you get defense spending under control? He's got to be a guy who's learned how to say no, and I've not seen that in his past. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official now at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal research organization, said Tower will face a severe test. `` The question is whether he will be able to put together the team that can take a $ 400 billion program and put it into a $ 300 billion budget,'' <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, however, said Tower's role should be to advocate <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and fight against cuts. `` Tower is not going to have to prove anything except that he has the wisdom and tenacity to minimize the damage done to national security by people trying to effect draconian cuts in the defense budget,'' <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Here is a look at <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for defense secretary. AGE: 63.

 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> administrators were wrong to have allowed the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to influence their decision to suspend an ordained priest from the school's theology department, a <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor has testified. `` The church does not have a juridical role in the academic world'' because academic freedom is ultimately left to peer judgment, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McBrien </PERSON>, chairman of Notre Dame's theology department. He testified at a non-jury trial Friday in support of the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, who, in a suit against <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, contends his January 1987 suspension violated his academic freedom. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s disagreement with church teachings on homosexuality, birth control and other positions were pubished in his book `` Faithful Dissent.'' Afterward <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials revoked <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s `` canonical mission'' to teach <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theology <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after it suspended him from its theology department on grounds that his writings were at odds with the faith. Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, archibishop of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and chancellor of the university, testified on Thursday that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had the authority to decide when an ordained priest no longer spoke for the church. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> testified that in suspending <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> he was enforcing the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s order. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> had taught at the school for 22 years. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1885 as one of a few `` pontifical universities'' directly governed by the church. In his testimony Friday, <PERSON> McBrien </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s theological department, which had been held in high regard in recent years, now enjoys less respect from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> academic community, in part because of the Curran suspension Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, the former chairman of the board of trustees of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, testified Thursday that the university was compelled by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s action against <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> to suspend him from the theology department. `` If we were to directly defy the Holy See,'' the school risked having its charter revoked, said <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, who is now the archbishop of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The trial continues on Monday, but lawyers representing both sides said a list of witnesses was being negotiated and had not been finalized.

<HEAD>ACLU Files Lawsuit In Protest Of Housing Project Sweeps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit against the city Friday, accusing housing officials of `` systematic warrantless searches'' of tenants and their visitors in an effort to crack down on drug selling. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officials later agreed to relax some of the security rules, but the lawsuit was not withdrawn from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The lawsuit stems from a security crackdown by the housing agency, which is trying to evict squatters and violent gang members who use the projects as havens for drug deals. The lawsuit seeks to stop searches of tenants and their apartments and to establish `` reasonable regulations'' on visits by family members and other guests. Under the existing regulations, `` all guests of residents in the building have to sign in with the guard at the front door and show a piece of valid identification,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` The policy has been that guests are asked to leave the building at midnight and are not allowed in until 9 a.m.,'' she said. No overnight guests are allowed unless the tenant has received prior approval. The lawsuit says housing officials and police `` have indiscriminately detained and searched tenants' persons and homes, going through drawers closets, personal effects'' and other items. `` These searches have been carried out without the consent of the tenants and any prior notice. If tenants object, they have been threatened with arrest,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The lawsuit cites the case of a tenant who was forced to find another babysitter for her sister's children after housing officials ordered the children out of her apartment at midnight. Under the new rules, `` The guest upon entry, will identify him or herself to CHA personnel,'' but will not need a piece of identification, although the tenant must confirm that the person is a guest, Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Overnight visitors would be issued guest cards, and residents could have long-term guests for a period of up to two weeks. Ms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> planned to present the proposals to the plaintiffs, and planned further discussions with the city. `` Our intent in all our security procedures is to provide for the safety and welfare of our residents and that will continue to be our objective,'' she said. The defendants are the housing agency, the city and police Superintendent <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Many Who Sought Personalized Benefit Statement Have Not Mailed

 Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> says many of the millions of people who flooded her agency with phone calls last summer for a new personalized benefit statement have not yet taken the trouble to complete the application. `` More than 6 million people have asked us for the statement. But only 35 percent of them have sent it back to us,'' <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> told reporters Friday. `` It's still hanging on their refrigerators.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had trouble fielding all the phone calls requesting its Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement -LRB- PEBES -RRB- when it became available in August. But <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the bottleneck on the phone lines has been cleared and `` we're ready, willing and able to provide them now. I would really like to have everybody have a PEBES in their stocking.'' The toll-free number to call is 1-800-234-5772. Operators are on hand to answer the calls at various Social Security centers from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time on weekdays. Those who call after working hours or on weekends will get a recording capable of taking messages. Once the form is mailed back, it takes the agency three weeks to crank out the estimates of future monthly retirement benefits, as well as how much a worker and family gets if he or she becomes disabled or dies. The agency also provides a year-by-year list of workers' wages and Social Security taxes. In other matters, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said she and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> were unable to get included in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 budget a proposal to eliminate a Social Security's earnings The earnings test reduces benefits of beneficiaries under age 70 who earn more than certain amounts. The thresholds this year are $ 8,400 for those ages 65-69 and $ 6,120 for those under 65; in 1989 they are $ 8,880 and $ 6,480 respectively. She also said, `` I'm hearing from seniors at town hall meetings that they are not pleased about the -LRB- income tax -RRB- surtax that's coming'' to pay for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s new catastrophic insurance benefit <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said she `` would n't be surprised'' if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took another look at whether to levy the 15 percent tax surcharge on the elderly to pay for the insurance, which starts in January. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> wants all 130 million American workers to request their earnings records at least once every three years both to ensure their wages were reported correctly, and to get a better idea of what to expect from Social Security upon retirement. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> hopes that people armed with that information will save more and rely less on the government for their retirement income. Currently, more than half the elderly rely on <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> as their main source of income. But the program was always intended just to be part of retirement income, she said.

While stopping short of urging an outright ban of beer, wine and liquor advertising, the panel said such ads should not be allowed on college campuses `` since a high proportion of audience reached is under the legal drinking age.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the workshop participants that his office had little money or power to implement policy, but promised to provide start-up funds for a non-profit, private corporation to serve as a clearinghouse for groups seeking ammunition to use in the war on drunken driving. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said that, for his part, he intends to be an aggressive but not shrill soldier. `` I intend to ignore those who would lynch or execute a first offender in drunk driving just as I will ignore those who would say it has not yet been proven that alcohol is responsible for impaired driving,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the workshop. `` I intend to pursue whatever leadership role I may have between these two extremes as I have with other issues and to transmit to that leadership whatever energy, enthusiasm and credibility I have in this war against impaired driving.'' The panel's other recommendations called for: _ Elimination of alcohol advertising and promotion and sponsorship of public events where the majority of the audience is under the legal drinking age _ Elimination of advertising that portrays activities that are combined with alcohol use _ Banning of sponsorship of athletic events by the alcohol beverage industry _ Blocking the use of celebrities who have a strong appeal to young people in alcohol advertising and promotion _ Requiring that the warning labels <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently voted to require on alcoholic containers also be required to appear clearly and conspicuously in all alcohol ads No specific monetary figures were contained in the section on taxes, but the panelist said excise tax rates at both the federal and state level should be equalized among beer, wine and liquor and indexed to rise automatically with inflation. The advertising section was most controversial, largely because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> and the advertising industry had declined to participate in the workshop, claiming it was stacked against advertisers' interests. `` In fact, the research the ad industry provided the panel demonstrates that there is no existing evidence that links advertising and alcohol abuse,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in a statement Friday. NAB President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> last month: `` At best, this workshop is designed to politicize the emotional tragedy of drunk driving. At worst, it is a total abuse of the policy-setting process.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who had not responded publicly to that charge, lashed back at the end of his remarks Friday. `` I wanted everyone to hear the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION>'s point of view not only because broadcasters are very influential, but because they also have so much at stake in this issue,'' he said. `` Hence, they certainly have the right to be here.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said he felt the criticism of the workshop was unfair and said he was `` taken aback'' by what he called <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>' `` unfortunate choice of words.''

<HEAD>President Says America No Longer The Dominant Global Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the last major foreign policy speech of his presidency that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` no longer enjoys preponderant power'' in the world. As a result, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, his Oval Office successors and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must not treat each other as `` adversaries'' but must work more cooperatively if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to be successful in pursuing its interests in the global arena. `` It is precisely where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have worked together, as in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, or resolved differences, as in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and many aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations, precisely there, -LRB- where -RRB- our policies have succeeded, and we see progress,'' the president on Friday told students and faculty at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, on the campus founded by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. `` But where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have engaged each other as adversaries _ as over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies have faltered and our common purposes have not been achieved,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he thought that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent years had taken on too great a role in making foreign policy. Instead of linking his own support for the Contra rebels to the difficulties in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' `` on-again, off-again indecisiveness on resisting Sandinista tyranny and aggression'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for leaving the area `` a region of continuing danger.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> complained about the War Powers Resolution, which gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a veto power over the commitment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops abroad after a 60-day period. He lamented attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` manage complex issues of foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation, such as unduly restrictive intelligence oversight, limits on arms transfers and earmarking of 95 percent of our foreign assistance, denying a president the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly changing conditions.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also lauded Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying `` let us credit him'' for his reforms. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must remain skeptical about the U.S.-Soviet relationship because `` serious problems, fundamental differences remain.'' `` Yes, we welcome Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent announcement of a troop reduction,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` but let us remember that the Soviet preponderance in military power in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> remains _ an asymmetry that offends our Jeffersonian senses _ and endangers our future.'' `` So we must keep our heads, and this means keeping our skepticism,'' he said. He credited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with taking `` some daring steps'' to bring about reforms that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said would have been unthinkable under former Soviet leaders <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The president said the superpowers are `` coming closer'' to agreement on a <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talks </ORGANIZATION> treaty, saying that `` where the portions of the draft treaty disputed by one side or the other are put in brackets, we are slowly seeing the brackets disappear.'' The president also credited <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` strong and steadfast'' support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s statehood for persuading the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to moderate its views toward the Jewish nation. `` That resolve has now paid off'' with the opening of a U.S.-PLO dialogue aimed at advancing peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech came in the wake of his decision to reverse a 13-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of refusing to have contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Where we are strong and steadfast, we succeed,'' he said. `` The country stood firm for years, insisting that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist ... and renounce terrorism.'' During a brief question-and-answer session with students, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the opening to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` a great step forward.'' But he said that peace will be achieved only `` when the principals come together to negotiate.'' White House officials have said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans a farewell address to the nation sometime in January _ probably from the Oval Office. But spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said Friday that he did not know of any other foreign policy addresses scheduled in the remaining 35 days of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency.

 Three of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s holy relics have changed hands. A piano played by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> in `` Casablanca,'' the hat worn by the Wicked Witch of the West in `` The Wizard of Oz'' and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>'s script for `` Gone With the Wind'' were all sold at auction Friday The Japanese trading company <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Itoh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> outbid developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to buy the piano for $ 154,000, on behalf of an anonymous `` Casablanca'' fan in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It's because many Japanese are fans of the old'40s movies,'' said a company representative, <PERSON> Mashahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaoka </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who was in the audience bidding, went home without comment immediately after the piano sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction house in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The green and beige upright piano, used in the flashback sequence of the 1942-43 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> classic, had a pre-sale estimate of $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 by <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Frankly, a dear price was paid for <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>'s script from the 1939 film `` Gone With the Wind'' _ $ 77,000, bid by telephone by <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purtan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s had listed an estimate of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 for the leather-covered script with <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>'s name embossed in bold. The auction catalog said <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> gave the script to an <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> studios </ORGANIZATION> secretary who was a `` close personal friend.'' An anonymous private collector in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> submitted the winning bid of $ 33,000 for the witch's hat. The black pointed hat was all that remained of the wicked witch when <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> accidentally melted her with a bucket of water. Nine stemware glasses from <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s Cafe Americain in `` Casablanca,'' estimated at $ 1,000 to $ 5,000, sold for $ 3,020. A Masonite advertising board used at the movie's 1943 premiere, estimated at $ 5,000 to $ 7,000, was sold for $ 22,000. The `` Casablanca'' piano was from the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> flashback scene at <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> -LRB- Bogart -RRB- and <LOCATION> Ilsa </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> -RRB- discuss love, marriage and the impending German occupation while <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> -RRB- plays `` As Time Goes By.'' Later, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ilsa </LOCATION> meet again at <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s Cafe in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> plays an encore on another piano. `` You played it for her. You can play it for me,'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> said. To which <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> replied, `` But I do n't think I can remember.'' `` If she can stand it, I can. Play it!'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> commanded, in a line that has since been widely misquoted as `` Play it again, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' Many famous props, such as the ruby slippers from `` The Wizard of Oz'' and the sled from `` Citizen Kane'' were made in multiples. However, `` This piano from the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> scene is truly unique in that it was actually used throughout the entire <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> cafe sequence,'' the auction catalog said. The piano also was used in 1943 in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Savings Bond drive featuring <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>.

 The $ 516 million-per-plane pricetag for the B-2 stealth bomber makes it the most expensive aircraft ever built, but <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> says whatever the radar-evading plane costs, it's worth it. The stealth bomber, which resembles a huge, tailless manta ray, is expected to make its first flight early next year but will not be ready for wartime use until 1992 at the earliest, <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> told a news conference the design, development and construction of 132 planes was expected to cost $ 68.1 billion by the time production ends in mid-1995. Expressed in terms of the original estimate, the price tag has grown from $ 36.6 billion to $ 42.5 billion in fiscal 1981 dollars _ an increase of about 16 percent, <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said. Those figures do not reflect cost increases caused by inflation since 1981 or that projected in future years. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must authorize and appropriate money for production, and the figures assume it will do so at the pace the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposes. <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said a stretchout of production would boost the per-plane cost by 20 percent or more. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> gave the public its first glimpse of the aircraft at a ceremony in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, last month. About one-third of the total cost of the long-range bomber is being spent on research and development. The actual production cost amounts to $ 305 million per plane, <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said. `` Whatever it costs, it's worth it,'' <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said. `` How much is deterrence worth? `` This thing is a significant contributor to the strategic deterrence of our country. The Soviets know it. They know the capabilities this aircraft can provide.'' <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, reviewing the results of a long-running internal review of the B-2, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had decided to slow production of the bomber during the early years of the program and to accelerate production at the end. He refused to offer specific numbers, but he said the acceleration at the end of the program would be such that production of all 132 of the planes would be completed a year early, in mid-1995. The latest cost projection includes estimated savings of about $ 3 billion, the secretary continued, thanks to the changes in production and a decision to purchase more than 100 of the planes under a single, multiyear contract. Few of the planes will be built while the bomber is undergoing flight testing in the early years, <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> explained. Once the flight testing is completed and the design frozen, a multiyear contract can be negotiated to achieve the most economical rate of production, he added. <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said a large portion of the cost increase _ about $ 1 billion in fiscal 1981 dollars _ `` results from a major redesign effort in 1983.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary said the redesign was ordered because the stealth bomber originally was meant only to fly at high altitude. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> decided in 1983 that the plane should be able to fly at low altitude as well and that forced a redesign of its flying wing shape, he said. The B-2 gets its stealth name from the claim that it will be extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar due to the extensive use of exotic composite materials, its lack of sharp surface angles, and a cross-section that offers a very small profile to radar. It is built mainly by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. At $ 516 million per copy, the B-2 would eclipse the new B-1B bomber, which cost about $ 280 million per copy, as the most expensive plane in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inventory The newest model of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial aircraft, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, sells for roughly $ 125 million. <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, appearing before <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reporters on his last day in office before joining the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the B-2 would fly for the first time `` as soon as it's ready,'' probably early next year. He said the first operational B-2 would be delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Whiteman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, in mid-1991 and that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> probably will select three additional bases to house them. It probably will be at least 1992 before the plane is certified for `` initial operational capability,'' meaning it could fly in a war, <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> accused radical Palestinians of trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO talks by staging violent riots in the occupied territories that left at least four Arabs dead. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and other officials refrained from direct comment Friday after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegates held their first face-to-face meeting in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, but they reiterated their opposition to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision to speak to the organization <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision was `` a grave mistake.'' `` You abandoned an important principle in the general American policy, the principle of opposing terrorism and waging war against it,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> spoke after the 90-minute meeting between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and a four-man <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, a suburb of the capital city <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. The defense minister said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should demand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> make <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> prove he was sincere when he said last week that he renounced all forms of terrorism. `` Our first demand from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be, put <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to a test, demand from him to come out and tell all the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in his voice, in Arabic, to stop terror,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. Despite his opposition to the American-PLO dialogue, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said it could lead to a decrease in violence. `` It was clear to us that a large part of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> -RRB- population will see the events of the week as their achievement, and will try to moderate their role in violence,'' he said. `` But it was also clear that radical elements who oppose these moves ... will try to heat up the area,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, echoed his party leader in saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative with its own peace plan, `` even if it would not be accepted in the foreseeable future.'' He spoke on one of the bloodiest days of the Palestinian rebellion against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In Friday's clashes, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot to death four Arabs, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said as many as 32 were wounded. It was among the worst violence since April 16, when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops killed 14 Palestinians during riots protesting the assassination in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military The latest deaths brought to 328 the number of Palestinians killed in the yearlong revolt. Thirteen Israelis have also died during the unrest. Meanwhile, aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc leader recognized the need for a credible Israeli peace plan. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the prime minister was considering `` new moves.'' `` Be sure that Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is preparing a peace move which will surprise everyone,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said, refusing to disclose details. Newspaper reports said the plan was to unilaterally establish a limited self-rule for Palestinians, as envisioned in the Camp David accords mediated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978. Friday's confrontations in the occupied lands were inspired by the death Thursday night of a teen-ager from a gunshot wound suffered Nov. 25, according to doctors at <LOCATION> Anglican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Army officials said the riots appeared premeditated and began in numerous areas even before the teen-ager's funeral in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofir </PERSON> said the high casualty toll `` resulted from the fact that we had to disperse riots in many locations.'' Doctors said 20 people were wounded in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, four of them critically. The army confirmed four killed and nine wounded. Soldiers wounded five Palestinians in villages near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including a 9-year-old boy shot in the neck, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said.

 The former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> will be opened to outsiders by Christmas, officials said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> has been closed to foreigners since <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> troops invaded the small island territory in 1975 following an outbreak of strife between rival nationalist movements and the end of <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> rule. International humanitarian organizations estimate as many as 100,000 people, one-sixth of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s population, may have died in the hostilities and from the disease and famine that ensued. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> subsequently annexed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> as its 27th province. Since then, people traveling to and from the territory have needed certificates issued by security authorities. The home affairs minister, <PERSON> Rudini </PERSON>, said Friday that the security situation in the area had improved, allowing a relaxation of controls. International groups have called repeatedly on <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> to allow humanitarian organizations into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> to observe the human rights situation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> also has called on <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to withdraw and allow residents of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> to determine their own future. Nationalist guerrillas on the island continue to resist <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule.

 Students cowered and cried `` Jesus save us! God save us!'' as a 16-year-old boy opened fire in their Bible class after he killed one teacher and wounded another, police said. The boy fired two shots in the classroom but did not hit anyone before his MAC-10 commando-style machine pistol jammed and he was subdued by a teacher and students at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. `` Once you see what went on in there, it's a miracle that we did n't have more people killed,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said Friday. Police spokesman <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON> said the 10th-grader was charged with first-degree murder, malicious assault, four counts of attempted murder, six counts of using a gun to commit a crime and three counts of discharging a firearm in an occupied building. He was in custody today. The boy's name was not made public because he is a juvenile, but relatives and neighbors identified him as <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shallenberg </PERSON>, a 12-year-old seventh-grader, said the suspect was a friend. `` He was always real nice and happy. He was never angry,'' <PERSON> Shallenberg </PERSON> said. `` This morning I noticed when I said ` Hi' to him he seemed kind of distant, like he was thinking of something. `` I just did n't know. I did n't know he was the kind of kid who would do something like that. He was n't one of the most popular kids around school but, yeah, he had friends.'' <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON> said police had no motive for the shootings. The dead teacher was identified as <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a 41-year-old mother of two. When she failed to show up for an emergency meeting of teachers about an hour after the shootings, authorities searched for her. They found her body behind a classroom door. Wounded was <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, 37, who was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the shoulder at <ORGANIZATION> Sentara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Police found what appeared to be three Molotov cocktails in the boy's locker and confiscated the gun and an unknown number of spent shell casings. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> and police were trying to trace the weapon's origin. Police said the boy apparently carried the gun in his knapsack and arrived by bus. It was not known if he attended any classes before the shootings began shortly before 10:30 a.m. Friday. The school, which is affiliated with the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, has 500 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The shootings occurred in a complex of four portable classrooms outside the main building. It was unknown when Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> was shot, but witnesses said after the boy had chased one instructor through the courtyard and shot <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, he ran toward a classroom of Bible students. The Bible teacher, <PERSON> Hutch </PERSON> <PERSON> Matson </PERSON>, and a student, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 17, locked the door just as the youth turned and climbed the stairs. Realizing the door was locked, the youth shot out the window and burst in. The boy aimed and fired two shots and missed, as fearful students cowered on the floor and cried out, `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> save us! God save us!'' Then, the gun jammed. <PERSON> Matson </PERSON> raced toward the student and tackled him, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The gun fired once more. `` At that time, as soon as I saw Hutch get a little control over him, some guys and I went over and got the gun from him,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` The locking up of the gun _ that was just a miracle.'' About 40 students witnessed the shootings. The chaos that followed saw students and teachers crying and anxious parents arriving to take their children home. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, whose daughter was in Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s geometry class, said other parents were shocked that the incident took place at a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> school, but added: `` Not everyone who goes to a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> school is close to the Lord, saved or perfect. What can I say?'' The Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said he talked with <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON>. `` You could tell she was quite distraught,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Foes of Church Closings Promote `Plantation
Mentality'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said a plan to close or merge 43 inner-city <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> parishes is needed to erase a `` plantation mentality'' in which white pastors and lay people run churches attended mostly by blacks. The plan, which would entail the largest church closing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Roman Catholic history, has angered members of the city's 112 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches since it was announced in September. The cardinal strongly defended the plan in a just-released transcript of a Dec. 3 meeting of leaders of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, which covers southeastern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and has 1.5 million members under <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>'s leadership. `` I know what I am doing and I believe that I am following God's will,'' <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said in the transcript `` They can lambaste me all they want, but my purpose is to fulfill the gospel, to make it possible for that gospel to be preached effectively to the people who are here now.'' Opponents of the closings, who include both black and white parishioners, picketed outside <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>'s home Friday. The number of Catholics in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> has decreased drastically as whites have fled the nation's sixth-largest city for the suburbs. In 1976, more than 100,000 Catholic households were in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, as against fewer than 50,000 now. About two-thirds of the city's 1.1 million residents are black, and the vast majority of church-affiliated blacks are <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said the plan, which targets parishes that are losing membership and are not considered economically viable, will help deal with the complaints of black Catholics that predominantly black parishes are led by whites. `` Black Catholics tell me that they no longer want the plantation mentality,'' the cardinal said. `` They do n't want this white pastor saying, ` Now you leave my black people alone, I'll take care of their needs.' `` We have the anomaly today of parishes which are predominantly black with a white pastor and a totally white staff. Why should n't these black people have the leadership in that parish Why should we be importing people from the suburbs, white people, to come in here and continue to run these parishes?'' Surveys found that 95 percent of the city's churches had strong black membership, but the operational structure was white, Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> said Friday. `` We're not denying the value of what any white priest, sisters or brothers have done in the city. But sometime we have to stop and see what's best for the church and say, hey, it's time for black Catholic leaders to be seen and heard,'' <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> said. But the Rev. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Sacred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a group fighting the plan, said the assessment was distorted. `` We run our own parish here,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a white pastor, whose church staff members are mostly black residents of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` I think -LRB- <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> -RRB- wants to do the right thing but he's being fed some very bad information and really is speaking with no experience on these things.'' <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, who has spent five years overseeing the study of urban churches, said he will deliver recommendations from appeal hearings on the closings to <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> on Monday. The cardinal is expected to make a final decision during the first week in January. The archdiocese also released a letter of resignation Friday from a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Implementation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, one of two panels formed to help <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> judge the viability of urban churches. Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said in the letter that she believes the board will recommend closing churches that proved they were healthy in appeal hearings. `` Many parishes slated to close have in fact demonstrated viability in ways that could be models for other parishes,'' she said. Under the plan, 42 churches in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and one in nearby <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> would close or merge with other parishes. Archdiocese officials held a series of hearings for parishes wishing to appeal the closings.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences `Drug Pusher' Psychiatrist To Five Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DERBY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A psychiatrist who illegally prescribed drugs to addicts has been sentenced to five years in prison by a judge who called him nothing but a `` highly educated, well-placed drug pusher.'' Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> also was fined $ 25,000 on Friday, given a concurrent five-year prison sentence for two counts of witness tampering and ordered to serve five years' probation after his release from prison. `` The bottom line is he's just another drug pusher _ in a tailored suit,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Leander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. In defense of his drug-prescription practices, <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> submitted a 2 -LCB- - page poem entitled `` Maverick in the State. In it, he expressed an anti-tax philosophy and claimed the right to treat patients without state interference. He also recited part of another poem in which he said voices, including that of <PERSON> Lucifer </PERSON>, encouraged him to try to influence a witness's testimony. <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>, 58, was arrested in December 1987 after an undercover agent from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> received prescriptions for narcotics from the doctor at his <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION> office without any examination. In October, <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> entered a guilty plea to six counts of illegally prescribing narcotics, and on Friday he submitted guilty pleas to the witness tampering charges. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuade </PERSON>, who prosecuted the case, said `` the amount of damage he has done is mind-boggling when compared to what a street dealer could even think of doing.'' According to prosecutors, <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> would see a stream of drug addicts and abusers at his office every Saturday, charging each visitor $ 20 to $ 30 apiece for writing a narcotics prescription. The visits would typically last only about 10 minutes. `` He's a plague on society. He is a plague on the poor,'' <PERSON> McQuade </PERSON> said. Undercover agents who watched his office said <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>'s visitors included `` every junkie we ever saw or heard of and a lot that we did n't,'' <PERSON> McQuade </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganim </PERSON>, told the judge the doctor deserved leniency because he is a manic depressive whose judgment was impaired by his failure to take proper dosages of his medication. `` The man needs help. He does n't need incarceration,'' <PERSON> Ganim </PERSON> said. But the judge said <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>'s mental illness could not be used as an excuse for his behavior. In spite of his illness, the judge noted, <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> had held a number of posts in the medical field in recent years. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> was nothing more than a `` highly educated, well-placed drug pusher'' who `` did it for the money.'' Psychiatrist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> testified at the sentencing hearing that <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>'s illness would not prevent him from knowing the difference between right and wrong. <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>'s attorney said the doctor's poem about being a maverick showed his judgment was impaired, `` because if there is ever a time he should be on his knees, this is it.'' The prosecution cited the poem as evidence <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON> `` puts himself above the law.'' But the judge said he was not going to be swayed either way by the poem, saying, `` I'm not a poetry critic.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ordered the revocation of <PERSON> Keelan </PERSON>'s license last August.

<TEXT>
 The cancellation of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bomber project has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate 3,100 jobs, but two congressmen whose region will be most affected promise to fight the government decision. The company announced the layoffs Friday in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to scrap the A-6G bomber in the 1990 budget, said <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. `` This is quite a parting shot from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, an administration that says it is committed to a strong defense,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision shortsighted. Both men vowed to fight to reverse the decision or to get additional work for <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> to avoid further cuts. Of the 3,100 jobs, 2,500 are from the company's operations on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The remaining 600 will be in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` Our whole industry is facing flat or declining budgets,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. A special edition of the company newspaper Friday morning carried word of the layoffs, which begin next month. `` We know it is unfair to tell them at Christmas but it would be unfair not to let them know what may be coming,'' said <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. The A-6G would have incorporated advanced digital electronics, satellite navigation capability and a more powerful engine. Grumman has been building the A-6 since the early 1960s, upgrading it several times over the years. The A-6G, an upgraded version of the bomber, would have generated 1,000 new engineering positions and brought in $ 250 million annually. In the past two years <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> has been bumped from three major military aircraft contracts. A contract to produce the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Advanced Tactical Aircraft, the replacement for the A-6, was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and General Dynamics in 1987, and the company also lost out in the bidding for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Advanced Tactical Fighter Grumman was at its peak in the late 1960s when it was building lunar modules and employed 40,000 workers. The company now employs 32,000 workers. About 1,800 of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> layoffs will occur in January, and the rest will come by the end of 1989. Grumman had announced layoffs in January 1987 and last March.

 A traffic gridlock at picturesque <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> along Highway 1 will be history if the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> gets its way. The panel has given preliminary approval to a $ 25 million bypass through a prized forest of old pines and oaks. Other agencies that would have to approve the bypass include the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> planners. The 11-0 vote Thursday has state highway engineers hoping they can ease a bottleneck on the state's 1,000-mile coastal Highway 1 that results from traffic turning into <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. The traffic can stretch as far as five miles without moving. `` <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> will never be the same after the first tree falls'' in <LOCATION> Hatton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, warned <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON>, a resident of the often tourist-choked seaside town where actor <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> served as mayor. The town nestles close to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, 120 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and just south of the <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Golf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Course </LOCATION>. It is populated by the wealthy and a colony of artists and writers. Called the <LOCATION> Hatton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> freeway project, the four-mile <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> bypass would run inland from Highway 1, on the north edge of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, through large virgin stands of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> pines and native live oaks, across the mouth of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the east, then back to Highway 1 on the south edge of town. During the three-hour meeting, commissioners heard nearly 40 witnesses, most of them opposed to the project. In proxy statements, <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> legislators approved the project. And <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Karras </PERSON> told the commission the bypass was `` crucially needed ... if we do n't get on with the project, there will be severe safety consequences.'' One prominent exception to the nearly solid governmental support for the Hatton Canyon project was Carmel Mayor <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>. She said there were strong objections to a `` Los Angeles-style interchange'' she said would be built at the north end of the bypass. `` This roadway should lie gentle on the land,'' she said, echoing a sentiment expressed in a letter by her predecessor, <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>. The issue of a Highway 1 traffic relief dates back to the 1950s.

 The Energy Department should be able to meet conditions set by three governors for resolving a deadlock over the storage of radioactive waste from nuclear weapons plants, a department official said. The governors of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> emerged from a private meeting Friday with pledges of cooperation from Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>. `` I think we've laid a solid groundwork for progress. We've put a process in place. ... I believe it will bear fruit,'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said. But the governors said they would continue to pressure the government to make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> honors its promise to hasten the opening of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a prototype storage facility under construction near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` We stand here today to say there is no way we can guarantee anything. There are uncertainties in the world, but I think we can bridge that,'' said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> following the three-hour meeting. The officials announced progress toward resolving the most immediate problem, triggered when <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> closed his state's borders to waste shipments in October to try to force the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> into action. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said he would reconsider his decision if the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> speeded up the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> plant's opening. His decision is expected next month. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said he decided to reconsider after being told in a classified briefing that his ban on waste shipments into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> could harm national security by forcing closure of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Since <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>' order, the material has been piling up at Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> has said he would close the plant when its temporary storage capacity is filled. That should occur between March and May. After the meeting, however, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he does n't anticipate closing the facility, although `` I can not work with additional storage in a metropolitan area of 1.5 million people.'' Waste is being stored temporarily at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> until the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> plant opens, which <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said probably wo n't be until November or December 1989. The plant, originally scheduled to open last fall, will store wastes, including equipment and clothing that has been contaminated during the weapons-making process, in salt deposits more than 2,000 feet underground. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said that before he allows shipments to the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> plant to resume, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must also keep its pledge to introduce legislation and begin administrative procedures for a land swap with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that must be completed before the pilot plant can open. The department also must prepare plans to remove the more than 4 million cubic feet of radioactive waste already stored in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` I said I would n't accept that old statement of ` trust me.' I said, ` show me,''' said <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>. `` I said, ` If you're sincere, come back and prove it to me in January and we'll reconsider.''' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said the department would appoint a task force to look for other temporary waste storage sites in case <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> refuses to lift his ban. But he expressed confidence that the necessary conditions could be met to continue operations at Rocky Flats and move forward with the opening of the pilot plant. One of the biggest stumbling blocks has been <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' failure to pass a bill to transfer several thousand acres of land around the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> plant from <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> control to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The opening also has been delayed because of lapses in engineering assessments and questions about water leakage at the site. <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said the department will have a bill introduced when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. The department also will start administrative procedures for the exchange should <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> move too slowly, he said. `` Clearly, I think the DOE is trying to turn up the heat,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, upon his return from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>More Found Alive In Quake Ruins, Search Goes On</HEAD>

 Rescuers found 21 people alive in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> more than a week after they were buried in an earthquake, and officials said the discovery persuaded them to extend the search for survivors. An Armenian official told a Politburo commission overseeing rescue operations that of the 135 people pulled from ruins, 21 were saved. His report was shown on Soviet television Friday night. `` In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> 110 were pulled out, and 20 were alive. In <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, only one was alive,'' said the official, who was not identified. He said the survivors were found Thursday. The discovery of one person still alive in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> spurred searchers there to continue looking for another 10 days, said the official. It was not clear how large an area would be included in the continued search. On Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official from the city said crews would begin Sunday to raze what remained of the city. An estimated 15,000 of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>'s 25,000 residents died in the Dec. 7 quake. <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> were two of the cities hit hardest in the quake, which killed an estimated 55,000 people and left 500,000 homeless in the Armenian republic. Tanks and armored personnel carriers sealed off <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> on Friday. At least 10 bulldozers were clearing away rubble, and trucks filled with debris were leaving the city. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told a Politburo committee meeting that some work was going slowly because relatives were lying in front of bulldozers to prevent them from moving in until their relatives' bodies were recovered. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that 22,312 dead had been recovered by Friday, 537 more than Thursday. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was bringing in 5,000 insulated winter tents and that Soviet officials were hoping to bring in 5,000 mobile homes to shelter men in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> who will work on reconstructing the city. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> also said Friday that Soviet doctors can handle the medical treatment of Armenian earthquake victims and do not need further international help. `` We can accept individuals -LRB- from abroad -RRB- to show them what has been done, but we do n't need medical assistance in the direct sense,'' said <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Venidiktov </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and former deputy health minister. He told a news conference in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that medical teams had come from throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the earthquake. Several foreign doctors have complained privately that their Soviet colleagues were not allowing them to treat patients with the millions of dollars worth of sophisticated medical equipment brought to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to handle the disaster. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> praised the work of the foreign teams and criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for providing inadequate assistance to the rescue groups from abroad. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an Armenian government representative, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikazyan </PERSON>, said each survivor would receive 500 rubles, or $ 833, and that families would get 2,000 rubles, or $ 3,333, in addition to the amount allotted individuals. The Soviet government frequently makes cash payments from the central budget to victims of accidents and disaster. Help continued to be offered from abroad. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the official Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian-Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> plans to take in children orphaned in the earthquake. The brief report gave no indication of how many children would be affected or when or how they would be taken to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will send a team of experts to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to assist in reconstruction efforts following a request from Soviet authorities. `` The focus of the rescue has shifted from life-saving efforts to reconstruction,'' the ministry said in a statement. `` We hope the team's research and analysis based on our country's expertise on earthquake studies and seismology can contribute to the reconstruction of the area.''

 The glow from an oil lamp illuminated the faces of the Armenian villagers who came in from the snow to visit the mayor in the plastic hut he and his family have lived in since the Dec. 7 earthquake. The mayor, <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Megerditchyan </PERSON>, who was pinned under a block of stone for several hours until his son rescued him, reassured the men of the village that their mountainside homes would be rebuilt within two years. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he will do something, and he will,'' <PERSON> Megerditchyan </PERSON> said, referring to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who toured the disaster area last week. In the meantime, authorities are faced with finding winter shelter for the estimated 500,000 survivors of one of the century's worst quakes The one-room corrugated shack, thrown up immediately after the earthquake with supplies from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, is cool already, and will offer scant protection when temperatures drop further this winter. Throughout the region, Armenians are preparing to endure the approaching Soviet winter and recover from the shock of an earthquake that killed at least 55,000 people. In <LOCATION> Lusakhpyur </LOCATION>, about 600 of the 1,000 residents already have left seeking warmth in the homes of friends and relatives who survived the quake. Seventy villagers were killed, including 50 children crushed in a grade school corridor as they ran from collapsing classrooms. Ice-covered mountain roads connecting northwestern Armenian villages were bumper to bumper Thursday with cars, buses and trucks, listing under the weight of refugees and their few belongings. Soviet military trucks with supplies of bread, milk, meat, heavy coats and boots struggled through the traffic to deliver supplies to the needy. People generally did not appear hungry or in need of warm clothes, although some complained the emergency rations were n't being distributed fairly `` They select those they want to give to, and there is a hierarchy,'' said Asat Petzosyan of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a city of about 25,000 almost wiped out by the quake. Officials say about 15,000 died in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. `` I need somewhere to sleep,'' <PERSON> Petzosyan </PERSON> said, rubbing hands scarred from digging through the rubble searching for family and friends. `` All I have been given is this coat.'' <PERSON> Petzosyan </PERSON> and his neighbors have gathered pieces of broken furniture and torn mattresses to create living rooms without walls around outdoor bonfires, their only protection against the icy wind. Down the street, an elderly man stood motionless, surrounded by the roar of bulldozers, staring into a heap of rubble two-stories high. Tears ran down his unshaven cheeks. `` My granddaughter is in there,'' he said faintly. `` She is four. I'm waiting for her.'' But a happy ending is unlikely. Soviet authorities, fearing the spread of disease from decaying bodies, began razing <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> on Friday. Later, workers rescued 21 people from the ruins in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, prompting authorities to extend their search for possible survivors. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, said the greatest challenge now is providing shelter for those who remain. `` It is a terrible dilemma of conflicting needs _ the need for sanitation and the feelings of relatives,'' he said. `` Officials say they will evacuate 70,000 people, but that leaves 430,000 without homes,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. `` Where do you put 430,000 people for the winter?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is bringing in 5,000 winter tents like those already delivered by the Norwegian army. And Soviet authorities are hoping to bring in by rail thousands of yurts, versions of the circular tents used for centuries on the frigid steppes of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Soviet soldiers are working beside civilian crews to quickly repair the rail lines just outside <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. Soviet officials also hope to bring in thousands of mobile homes for the local men who will be rebuilding their town. <PERSON> Azen </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, a worker at an elevator factory, will stay in the mobile home camp near <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON>, will join her children next week at a temporary shelter set up by his trade union to house survivors. `` I do n't want to leave until <PERSON> Azen </PERSON> is in a warm place, but I wish they would hurry,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, one of the few women in town who did not lose a member of her immediate family. `` When they rebuild <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, I guess I'll be back. But really, after all this, I am so afraid of the mountains.''

<HEAD>Lear Jet Overshoots Destination, Crashes In Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Lear Jet flying from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> mysteriously overflew its destination and crashed in rugged mountains of northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with two people aboard, officials said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Torreon </LOCATION> said the search for the plane was called off Friday because of darkness and rough terrain and would resume today, with the help of a farmer who reported seeing the downed plane and two bodies. The jet, which left <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, at about 5 a.m. Friday, crashed two or three hours later in a mountainous region 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The plane had a flight plan for <LOCATION> Addison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> suburb north of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Telkins </PERSON>, embassy press attache. An F-16 and another plane tried to intercept and contact the jet's pilot after the plane overshot its destination, but the pilot did not respond, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Araceli </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, a police spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION>, 120 miles outside <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, said authorities reported a small plane was seen early Friday and appeared in trouble, possibly low on fuel. `` Then they lost contact,'' Ms. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said by telephone. `` It appears to be a foreign plane.'' Ms. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said authorities immediately dispatched police units and a helicopter to search the area. The co-pilot was <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, according to the craft's owner, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Crownrich </PERSON>. The name of the pilot was not immediately known. <PERSON> Crownrich </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Crownrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said the jet was used for his business most of the time but was on a charter run at the time of the crash. Ms. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and a pilot routinely flew to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to pick up <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> packages for delivery, he said. But <PERSON> Crownrich </PERSON> said the regular pilot was not aboard the latest flight. `` It came as a bolt of lighting to me,'' said <PERSON> Crownrich </PERSON>. `` I flew the plane yesterday to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and it was just purring like a kitten'' at up to 45,000 feet, which is its normal flying altitude. He said something could have happened to the plane's occupants or the craft could have been sabotaged. `` It is pretty obvious that the plane was performing well and was bound to be on auto pilot, and it flew that course on until fuel starvation,'' he said. `` But why the pilot and co-pilot were not able to talk to the flight service is beyond me.''

 Sinhalese extremists killed more than 425 people the past month in an attempt to disrupt Monday's presidential election, officials said today Cabinet minister <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrera </PERSON> said 405 people were killed by militants from Nov. 16 to Dec. 14 in Sinhalese-dominated central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The minister spoke in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before the 168-member house voted 65-2 to extend indefinitely emergency laws in effect since 1983. The laws give the government broad powers to detain people suspected of arson, violence and instigating strikes. At least 23 people were killed Thursday and Friday, police and military officials said. The victims included three policemen killed Friday when suspected Sinhalese extremists attacked police patrols in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, said the military officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. The killings are part of a campaign of violence aimed at disrupting presidential polls scheduled Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main militant Sinhalese group, has called for a boycott of the polls, claiming they will not be conducted fairly The group has called for the dismissal of the government and organized a series of crippling strikes in the Sinhalese heartland. It says the government gave too many concessions in a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending a 5-year-old insurrection by guerrillas from the minority Tamil community. Members of the front have been blamed for bomb attacks on meetings of opposition presidential candidates <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonasekara </PERSON>. Two bombs exploded at a public meeting Friday addressed by Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, a former prime minister and leader of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. She was unhurt. <PERSON> Abeygoonasekara </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which is composed of four leftist parties, has survived three assassination attempts since he announced his candidacy last month. Monday's vote is to choose a successor to President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who by law can not be elected to a third term. The candidate of his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>. Sinhalese form 75 percent of the island's 16 million people. Tamils make up 18 percent of the population. Tamil rebels have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland on the island's north and east, claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese in jobs and education.

 Five `` C'' batteries have certainly brought a charge to <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s life. Mrs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 46, wrote an angry letter to the makers of <ORGANIZATION> Rayovac </ORGANIZATION> batteries, complaining the batteries worked a little too well. Her husband, <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>, bought a radio-controlled model car in March that required five `` C'' batteries. The car's instructions said the vehicle would run for about one hour without needing new batteries. `` Your stupid batteries lasted for over four hours of constant operation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> wrote in her letter to the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, company. When she came home from her secretarial service job, she found the noise only mildly annoying. But things got worse. `` By 8 p.m. I was muttering under my breath,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> wrote. `` By 8:30 I had to throw both husband and toy out in the yard to play for a while ... by 9:30 I was gritting my teeth; and by approximately 10:18 those stupid batteries finally, thank God, ran out.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rayovac </ORGANIZATION> responded by sending her a bunch of flashlights and batteries and also making a commercial based on her letter that has been running nationwide since November.

 An alleged divorce-fixing scheme involving former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> struck at `` the firmest pillar of good government,'' a prosecutor said as four days of closing arguments ended. After hearing defense and prosecution lawyers finish their summations on Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> said he would turn the case over to the jury after instructing them on the law. The panel should get the case Monday afternoon. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1945 and once <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence a judge's rulings in the divorce of her lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> According to prosecutors, former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> slashed <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s weekly support payments to his estranged wife weeks after Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> gave a $ 19,000-a-year city job to the judge's daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, in August 1983. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43, and Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who turned 76 Friday, are all charged with plotting to fix the divorce and then cover up the scheme. In addition, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> is charged with obstruction of justice. She faces a maximum 30 years in prison and $ 513,000 in fines if convicted on all counts. Her co-defendants face up to 25 years and $ 263,000 if convicted. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> noted that carved on the facade of the court building where the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> divorce proceedings were conducted are the words: `` The true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good government. `` The scheme in this case, ladies and gentlemen, struck at that pillar.'' Previously, <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> derided the prosecution case as `` a soap opera, not a criminal trial.'' But <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> maintained: `` This is not a soap opera. It's a crime.'' Most of the government case was based on circumstantial evidence because neither an eyewitness to the alleged bribe plot nor tape recording of it existed. The main prosecution witness, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, testified that after a grand jury began an investigation in 1986, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> urged her `` to keep your mouth shut'' because `` you could be dangerous.'' But on cross-examination, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> admitted her trial testimony differed from what she had told investigators and the grand jury on several occasions. <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>, who got Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> to admit that electroshock treatments for depression had left her memory like `` Swiss cheese,'' told the jury that `` she's a walking definition of reasonable doubt.'' To convict on any of the charges, jurors must find the government proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

<HEAD>Japanese Ships Depart For Controversial Whaling Research Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Government officials said four Japanese whaling ships left today for the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, where they plan to catch 300 whales in a controversial research program. The departure of the fleet was delayed more than a week while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> tried to lessen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to the research plan. `` We wanted to show the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is proceeding seriously, within the provisions of the charter of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Last spring, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government banned Japanese fishing boats from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters because of the whaling research, which it charged was `` diminishing the effectiveness'' of a moratorium on commercial whaling imposed in 1986 by the 42-member Whaling Commission. `` Basic differences remain between the two sides,'' another official said, also speaking on condition he not be named. `` We believe that we have done everything possible to try to get the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to understand our position.'' The efforts included visits by Japanese officials to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and contacts by embassy officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's biggest consumer of whale meat, officially ended its commercial whaling in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> at the end of the 1986-87 season, after it caught 1,941 whales. Last season it announced it would kill 875 whales for research purposes but reduced that to 300 after international environmental groups charged the research program was `` commercial whaling in disguise.'' Officials say Japanese whalers last year actually caught 273 whales, all minkes, a variety not in immediate danger of extinction. `` From our perspective, some groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been taking the whaling issue to an extreme, turning it into a moral question rather than a scientific question,'' the second official said. `` Japanese people do n't see why you should n't kill even one minke whale if more than 700,000 currently exist, and do n't believe that eating whales makes you a barbarian.'' The whaling commission passed the commercial whaling moratorium to give scientists a chance to evaluate whale stocks. The moratorium is to be evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research findings. Under the commission's charter, each member country is able to conduct whaling research whenever it wishes. However, environmental groups have charged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is using that clause as a way to get around the whaling ban and maintain its whaling industry. Japanese officials, in turn, charge other commission members have not been seriously conducting research during the moratorium period and plan merely to renew the ban in 1990. Only a minority of commission members are whaling nations. Japanese officials say a representative sampling of whales must be killed to accurately study their age, sex, diet and health. Anti-whaling groups say other research methods are available that do n't involve killing. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hopes the research will prove there are sufficient numbers of some whale species, such as the minke, to allow resumption of limited commercial whaling in 1990.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14 fighter jet struck another jet while attempting to land and crashed into nearby waters, but both crewmen aboard escaped uninjured, authorities said. The fighter crashed shortly before 7 p.m. Friday on approach to a runway at the air station, which occupies the northern end of an island 5 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` The whole plane was shattered into pieces of debris,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Coxswain <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, who was in charge of one of the rescue boats. The pilot and radar officer, who ejected from the aircraft, were pulled from the <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estuary </ORGANIZATION>, one by a passing tugboat. The other was found about 150 yards from shore by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescue boat. The crewmen, who were not identified, were taken to a naval hospital by ambulance, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. He added both were in `` very good condition'' and were being observed for possible effects of shock. The aircraft was one of three F-14s in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The others had landed and the third was about to touch down when it clipped a wing of one of the F-14s already on the runway, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>. The plane then veered off and crashed, sinking in about 12 feet of water, <PERSON> Valente </PERSON> said. In 1972, the $ 30 million F-14 Tomcat became the standard fleet flighter aboard aircraft carriers. It was popularized in the movie `` Top Gun'' starring <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>. The plane's wings can extend to 64 feet for takeoff and landing and can be swept back to 33 feet to reduce air drag at high speeds.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has reversed a decision to limit installations and repairs at four crime-riddled public housing projects, one of which is so violent that letter carriers get police escorts. The phone company had scaled back service in <LOCATION> Bankhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courts </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardens </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> apartments after a female technician was harassed at <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> by six men who accused her of being a police officer. One man drew a gun while the others rifled her van. The woman was released when the resident whose phone she had repaired came outside and vouched for her, phone company spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON> said. The company had restricted service calls to Monday mornings, except for emergencies, and only allowed workers to enter the projects in groups. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials announced Friday that they were changing that policy and said they had scheduled a meeting Monday with Police Chief <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON> to discuss security precautions. The <ORGANIZATION> Bankhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> housing project has a reputation for danger. Crime statistics on the project itself were unavailable, but the Zone 1 police precinct, which covers the 25 square miles encompassing the project, reported 41 homicides, 122 rapes and 609 robberies in 1987, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>. In October 1988, the zone reported six homicides, 16 rapes and 145 robberies, she said. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> had condemned the phone service cutback, and <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoke </PERSON> said that the authority was `` outraged'' by it. Postal officials suspended service in the project for one day, after shots were fired near a letter carrier Dec. 10. City officials criticized the move, and service to the 500-unit complex resumed Wednesday under police escort. <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON> said the initial decision to restrict service calls resulted because `` we've had folks flash guns and pull knives on our installers, and threaten to use explosives on our vans.'' The service restrictions were the latest events in the Bankhead Courts crime drama, which police officials say has been violent and drug-ridden for most of its 19 years. Four police officers were injured there while making arrests in a Nov. 5 drug sweep that led to the arrest of 12 residents. A Nov. 10 raid, by 37 officers, led to 27 arrests _ nine on drug charges and 18 for traffic violations and other charges. A 24-year-old woman, who journeyed into the complex with friends, was killed Nov. 3 when a drug dealer, fearing undercover police officers, opened fire on her car as it approached with its headlights off.

 A spokeswoman for the television performers union has confirmed a report that union leaders are preparing for a `` possible work stoppage'' against the three networks. <PERSON> Pamm </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON> of the 68,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> said Friday a report in <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> that a strike may be imminent is correct.

Intensive negotiations since then have been unable to produce a settlement acceptable to both parties. The talks will resume Jan. 16.

 Wall Street is a house divided as Christmas approaches, with merger specialists raking in big year-end bonuses while brokers fear layoffs because of the slump in stock trading. `` Somebody could easily say it's like <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>: It's the best of times, it's the worst of times,'' said <PERSON> PJ </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The surge of takeover business this year has enriched investment bankers. The kingpin of leveraged buyouts, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is likely to earn $ 40 million to $ 50 million or more this year, estimated Perrin Long, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, Wall Streeters whose livelihoods depend on the volume of stock trading are suffering because transactions by individuals and institutions have tailed off since the crash of Oct. 19, 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced this week it had laid off about 120 employees, largely in its municipal bond and stock departments. That was a fraction of the 1,800 that <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it will lay off come January, but it nonetheless sent tremors through Wall Street. <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that depends heavily on retail brokerage business, saw its profits slashed in half through the first nine months of the year. It has had no major layoffs and none are in the works, but many brokers who work on straight commissions have left. `` The mood is probably as bad as I've seen it since 1972 or 1973 when the bear market was really bad,'' said <PERSON> Bard </PERSON> <PERSON> Quku </PERSON>, a senior vice president for sales at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quku </PERSON> said his own business has held up well. But he said, `` There's some people who are losing hope.'' `` The mood has not been a real jovial one the last month or two,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an executive recruiting firm that specializes in top-paying Wall Street jobs. Spirits have picked up recently as it became apparent that bonuses overall would not be slashed from their 1987 levels, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. Bonuses may fall 20 percent to 50 percent for stock traders and municipal finance specialists, but rise for investment bankers, he estimated. Income producers like sales people and investment bankers get money from a bonus pool based mainly on performance. Back-office employees, from mailroom clerks to the personnel director, are getting bonuses equalling about 20 weeks of their salaries. The decline in living standards is, of course, all relative. `` Even in this operating environment, anyone who wants to work hard and has a little bit of luck, he or she can probably make more on Wall Street than just about anyplace else,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Retrenchment in many cases means selling a second house or forgoing an expensive vacation. `` I spoke to someone yesterday who had a horse farm in <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> who's selling the horses, selling the farm,'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> canceled money for Christmas parties this year, as it did in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, but employees in retail trading put up $ 100 apiece so they could have their own party Friday night. `` We only took the hundred bucks from the people we thought could afford it, the ones making six figures,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, the senior executive vice president for retail trading. `` Everybody has confidence at <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION> that this, too, will pass and things will get better,'' <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON> said. The downturn on Wall Street has provoked some to go into businesses they once disdained. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said he knew of a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate, who probably made $ 1 million a year at his peak, who left investment banking to go into the family clothing retailing business. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, writes a yuletide review of the year each Christmas, and this year the theme was the slump on Wall Street. It said in part: `` The year eighty-eight found the markets less frisky `` As investors judged trading as overly risky. `` So many decided, on the sidelines they'd stay `` And the rest took great care when the markets they'd play.''

<HEAD>Palme's Widow Agrees to Identification Attempt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The widow of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> has agreed to try to identify a 41-year-old Swede being held in the investigation of her husband's assassination, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who was arrested Wednesday, pleaded innocent Friday in a preliminary hearing, but a judge ruled there were reasonable grounds to suspect he killed <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> and ordered him held for further investigation. Palme, the dominant figure in Swedish politics for more than a decade, was killed Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home unguarded from a downtown movie theater with his wife <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was grazed by a bullet in the shooting, which took place at close range. The Expressen newspaper said Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was willing to try to identify the suspect but that it remained unclear whether she would be summoned to do so. `` We would like to spare her as long as possible,'' the newspaper quoted a source close to the investigation as saying. `` If we can do without her testimony we will try to do that.'' In another development, prosecutor <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON> complained about the publication of <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s picture in foreign newspapers, saying that would complicate the case. `` If a witness says he has seen the photograph of a suspect in the paper, the value of the evidence will be rather low at a confrontation,'' <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON> said on Swedish Radio. Several witnesses have identified <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as the man seen standing outside the movie theater before the Palmes emerged, press reports said Saturday. But no evidence has emerged that he was the gunman. The killer followed the couple down the street for several blocks before the shooting, then escaped down a dark alley. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s press and libel regulations prohibit publication in this country of the names and pictures of suspects in criminal cases, in some instances even after a person has been convicted. However, personal information about Swedes is easily available from various national offices. Since his arrest, <PERSON> Petterson </PERSON>'s name has been a matter of public record, and anyone can obtain a picture of him for a 50-cent fee at the central passport office. Public records show <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> has a history of psychiatric treatment, drug and alcohol abuse and a long criminal record, including a conviction for manslaughter. Norwegian, Danish and English papers published the name and photograph of <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, and foreign papers available in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> were sold out at some news stands. Many papers hailed the arrest and Friday's arraignment as a major breakthrough in a case that has been a national frustration for nearly three years. Government commissions accused police of bungling in the crucial first days of the manhunt. The chief investigator has been replaced twice, and a private investigation led to the resignation of Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> in June. But prosecutors have put forward no motive, and the murder weapon was not found. `` After nearly three years of uncertainty, the Palme murder is now on the way to a solution,'' anchor man <PERSON> Jarl </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredius </PERSON> said on Friday's nightly news.

 The Roman Catholic cardinal of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> and two other priests were attacked and beaten during Mass today by a man who told authorities he was possessed by the devil, police said. Police and witnesses said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> barged into a church in <LOCATION> Talisay </LOCATION>, seven miles south of this provincial city, rushed the altar and struck Cardinal <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> in the face with his fist.

 Student radicals and dissidents today attacked a government party office and staged anti-government demonstrations demanding the arrest of the disgraced former president, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. News reports said about a dozen students briefly occupied an office of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the southern city of <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>. `` Arrest <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>,'' they shouted while attacking the office and destroying windows with rocks and steel pipes, according to the reports. Police, firing tear gas, retook the building in 20 minutes and arrested six students, the reports said. The other students ran away, they said. In southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 1,200 radical students and dissidents held an outdoor rally denouncing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> for blocking public efforts to divulge more details of misdeeds committed during <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s administration.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said today the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s main priority in talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to push for an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Speaking with reporters after his arrival in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> a day after the historic opening of an official U.S.-PLO dialogue, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also said he would do his best to prevent his followers from carrying out any terrorist attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman described as a `` step in the right direction'' Friday's meeting between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and a four-man <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s prime objective in the talks is `` to push forward for the international conference to be held very soon.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected proposals for an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which would include the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ and the parties to the conflict. Asked if he could assure that no Palestinian terrorist attacks would be staged, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said it is difficult to control all individuals or groups, but he added, `` We will do all our best to stop all this.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also suggested, without providing any details, that he played a role in the freeing Friday in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> official of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> who had been kidnapped a month earlier. No group claimed responsibility for his abduction. `` When I was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> asked me to help release the Swiss employee, and he has been released,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said without elaborating. He condemned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers for killing at least four Palestinians during clashes in the occupied lands on Friday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called it `` continuing state terrorism.'' He said, `` It is a message from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military junta and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders -LRB- who are -RRB- still refusing to accept peace, a just peaceful settlement.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to meet again, but he did not say when. The chief <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON>, said the next talks would take place after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office Jan. 20. Friday's meeting between delegations led by <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, came two days after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reversed a longstanding policy of refusing to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it did so because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> met conditions set for the talks, including recognizing <LOCATION> Isreal </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renouncing terrorism. The historic session inspired hope in many quarters that advances can be made in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process, which had stagnated recently. `` We hope the application of this change in the policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be practiced through a real pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in order to change the policy of occupation, the policy of terrorism, the policy of oppression against our Palestinian people,'' <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON> said after the 90-minute session Friday. `` Our discussions were very practical and characterized, I would say, by seriousness of purpose,'' <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> said after his 90-minute session with a four-man <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador implied there would be other meetings but did not say when. `` It is our hope that this dialogue, as it develops, will help bring about direct negotiations that will lead to comprehensive peace,'' said <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, who was accompanied to the talks by <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, political counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. The meeting took place at <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maghrebia </LOCATION>, an official Tunisian government guest residence in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, a suburb just north of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Neither side gave substantive details of the talks.

 The mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia today rescued three <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> soldiers serving with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force who had been kidnapped a day earlier by pro-Iranian guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most influential Shiite Moslem cleric was quoted as saying he had `` suspended'' efforts to win the release of 14 foreigners held hostage. His comment was published today, one day after a Swiss hostage was freed. `` I have suspended my initiative on behalf of the hostages because it reached a dead end,'' the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Liwaa </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> is the spiritual guide of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella group for pro-Iranian factions holding most hostages. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 32, was freed Friday night in <LOCATION> Hisbeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the southern city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the same spot where he was abducted Nov. 17. The Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> would probably fly home Sunday via <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The abduction of the Irish soldiers occurred Friday in <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, a village bordering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone. The abductions were apparently intended to retaliate for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s seizure Thursday of guerrilla commander <PERSON> Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasfi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> Police sources said the kidnappers demanded the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, with which the Irish soldiers served, negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the release of <LOCATION> Kasfi </LOCATION> and three other guerrillas seized Thursday by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Israeli military command said <PERSON> Kasfi </PERSON> was suspected of organizing and participating in kidnappings and dozens of attacks against Israeli army forces and the allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia since 1984. Today's rescue was daring, resulting in the capture of 22 <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots who helped abduct the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> soldiers, a police spokesman said. The spokesman said the three were rescued from a house in <LOCATION> Sultaniyeh </LOCATION>, a village one mile outside <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, headquarters of the 620-strong Irish battalion serving with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force. The rescue operation, according to the spokesman, was completed at dawn when 15 guerrillas of the `` Faithful Resistance surrendered to Amal and set free the three Irish soldiers.'' The Faithful Resistance is a small group of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists affiliated with the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. `` The fighters surrendered after Amal militiamen, in a smart and quiet move, arrested the <ORGANIZATION> Faithful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>'s seven commanders in the whole region,'' the spokesman said. `` The fighters surrendered because they did n't know what to do after Amal arrested their commanders. They surrendered peacefully.'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, who spoke to journalists as he was driven out of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said of his captivity, `` I've never known that four weeks can be as long as that.'' Asked if he would resume <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said: `` I'm afraid I will have to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> soon. ... My enthusiasm has suffered.'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> looked fit, with no sign of maltreatment. In <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, Swiss Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s captors tried to tie his release to a lenient sentence for a jailed Lebanese plane hijacker, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> refused any concessions. <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said that in indirect contacts, the kidnappers identified themselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group named `` <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauffin </PERSON>, acted as intermediary after the hijackers contacted him Tuesday, <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> told a press conference. He said recent talks between a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> official and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also were `` useful.'' He did not elaborate. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> suggested, without providing any details, that he played a role in the freeing <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, the Swiss Foreign Ministry's No. 2 man, met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> told reporters today that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> asked for a drawing of the place where <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was kidnapped to determine whether it was in Palestinian-controlled territory. The recent political successes of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> may also have contributed to <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s early release, <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said. The Christian-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio station said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla group headed by Palestinian terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. A police spokesman quoted <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> as saying he did not know the identity of those who held him but that the captors told him `` that I was being held to guarantee that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> will be treated well in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem Lebanese, goes on trial in <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION> on Feb. 20 on charges of hijacking an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afrique </ORGANIZATION> jetliner on July 14, 1987, and forcing it to land at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport. He is accused of killing a French passenger. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s release leaves 14 foreigners, including nine Americans, held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 A woman getting out of a taxicab fell through a sidewalk subway grating 50 feet onto the tracks below, where she was partially wedged beneath an electrified third rail, officials said. However, the 28-year-old woman apparently did n't touch the 600-volt third rail, officials said. She was hospitalized today in critical condition with a broken pelvis and numerous cuts. The grating in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> may have been weakened because cars were driven over it during road repairs, said <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Transit officials said they did n't know whether <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> stepped onto the grating and it fell under her weight or whether it had fallen into the air vent before the accident Thursday night. The metal grating was found 11 feet down the shaft. Power was shut off within five minutes of the accident and service was disrupted on two lines for 25 minutes, <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. The six-lane parkway, which has single-lane access roads on both sides, is under reconstruction. People living in buildings on the access roads often drive across a median because their lanes are blocked, <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Monday for the first visit by an Indian prime minister since his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawalharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, made the trip 34 years ago. For <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s nation and his political future, the stakes appear high. For <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, little seemingly can go wrong. During a week long on symbolism but short on substance, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> will be feted in the capital, tour the ancient city of <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> and visit <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. The visit, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> recently said, will be `` very important ... for this globe, for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and for both of us.'' The two nations _ the world's most populous _ will probably sign agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and technology, Indian and Western diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also may agree to establish consular offices. But no substantial progress is expected on the critical issue of their 2,400-mile border, over which the two countries fought a brief war in 1962. The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little progress. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of Indian territory. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> rejects the claim and demands that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> return the 15,200 square miles it took in the 1962 war. Since then, relations have improved, but only slightly. The border remains heavily guarded on both sides and bilateral trade, which resumed in 1977 but amounted to only $ 150 million last year, is limited. Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> say <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s visit is intended to create an atmosphere for greater communication and not to resolve the border question. But Western diplomats said pressures on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> could make him more willing to compromise than his Chinese counterparts. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is moving quickly to improve relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after nearly three decades of hostility. A summit between Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> may be held next year. Better Chinese-Soviet relations will eliminate <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s need to cultivate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dehli </LOCATION> as a foil against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. And by removing tensions along its northern border, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be under less pressure to accomodate <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on its southern flank. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continues its close relationship with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s traditional enemy <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s new prime minister, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, is expected to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in January on her first official trip abroad. `` For <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the whole visit has an air of him running along so he does n't get left out in the cold,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> who recently returned from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` For the Chinese, the visit ca n't possibly go wrong.'' A society that speaks with one voice when it comes to foreign affairs, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has watched with apparent enjoyment as the Indian press has pressured <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to make progress on the border issue, Western diplomats said. `` The prime minister has decided to stick yet another label to his travel bags,'' wrote the normally pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> in an editorial Wednesday. `` The more important question, however, is, what is the prime minister going to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for?'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also faces an election next year in which victory is far from certain. Diplomats say he must convince his public that simply establishing goodwill with the Chinese _ and not achieving a dramatic breakthrough _ is a worthy goal. `` If he feels that he is failing at that, he might be persuaded to do something rash,'' the Western diplomat said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could use the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the exiled <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> leader who has taken refuge in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since 1959, to embarrass the Chinese. The Tibetan refugees' parliament-in-exile on Friday called on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to raise the issue of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> with Chinese leaders. But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s hand is weakened by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s apparent willingness to crush dissent in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, regardless of international opinion. On Dec. 10, police shot and killed at least one monk in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, during an anti-Chinese demonstration. In addition, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> also has backed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s claims to the region. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the early 1950s. Relations soured in the early 1960s over the border question and political disagreements. Relations improved slightly in the late 1970s. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> invited an Indian leader to visit as early as 1979, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed to come only in November of last year. Western diplomats say the timing of the acceptance was significant because it came well after Sino-Soviet relations had begun to improve.

<HEAD>Bush Will Sail To Ceremonial Victory In Electoral College</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 48 million people cast ballots for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president six weeks ago, but the 538 who really matter will vote Monday. That's when the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> meets in an antiquated and much maligned constitutional ritual that has survived for two centuries. Expect no surprise here. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should defeat Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 426 votes to 112 votes _ give or take a `` faithless elector.'' In state capitals around the nation on Monday, the electors will meet to cast their votes and sign half a dozen documents swearing they've done their duty. This sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 4, when Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, will open the ballots and anounce the results _ and formally declare himself the president-elect. The political parties in each state pick prospective electors _ one for each congressman and senator the state has. While voters on Nov. 8 may have thought they were voting for one of the presidential candidates, they really were casting their ballots for the Republican or Democratic slate of electors in their state. The party that wins a state sends its electors to the meeting set by law for Monday. Among those who have the honor and duty are some of the vice president's relatives: son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and brother <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` I think it was a nice honor, to get to cast a vote for my dad,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> oilman, said. `` It'll be nice to be a small footnote in history.'' Among others with the duty are <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s designated White House chief of staff, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, who seconded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination at the Republican National Convention, is a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> elector. But most are state party workers or insiders rewarded for their labors, and state officeholders, such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. Guy Hunt. In the 10 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that were carried by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Democratic electors will vote. Electors are expected to vote for their party's presidential nominee and vice presidential nominee. But in this unique American system, they do n't have to _ and therein lies the potential for mischief or intrigue. In nearly 200 years, eight electors have broken their pledge and voted for someone else. The lure of making some dramatic point, and gaining widespread if fleeting notice, endures. A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> elector, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, treasurer of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Farm-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has said he may cast a symbolic vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for vice president instead of Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the party's nominee. And this year, with the furor over <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican vice presidential running mate still fresh in memory, some electors have been getting letters urging them to `` Dump Quayle'' and cast vice presidential ballots for someone else. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does not have to be the next vice president. Just ask the framers of the Constitution, who devised the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> precisely to deal with the current predicament,'' law journalist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> wrote in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times opinion-page article last month. Such a case for rests on the argument that the founding fathers envisioned the electors as truly deliberative. Of course, the founding fathers did n't know about the emergence of the two dominant parties, or a nation attuned to instantaneous communication, when they added the provision during the constitutional convention of 1787 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. They saw it as an elite group of wise men to be trusted with the decision. In fact, about half the states now have laws rquiring the electors to vote as pledged. But experts say the laws might not pass a constitutional test and may be unenforceable. In the past, some have proposed scrapping the entire <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> system and provide for direct election. A middle-ground proposal is to keep the electoral system but do away with electors _ that is, award electoral votes automatically. But all efforts to make such changes have fallen short in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The last serious effort was in 1979, when the change won a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but fell well short of the two-thirds needed for a consitutional amendment. The move was opposed by a conservatives, by small states that feared they would be overlooked in campaigns without electoral votes, and some black leaders and other minorities who shared similar concerns. Former Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ who was unseated in 1980 by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ sponsored the change. He argued that the system is undemocratic because it poses the potential for a candidate to be elected without winning the popular vote. That has happened: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in 1824, <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> in 1876, and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> in 1888. But do n't look for it from the electors of 1988. `` They're going to do their duty, as the people instructed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> press </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruggi </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adviser Says Soviets Afraid of Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Communist Party Politburo member said in remarks published Saturday that Soviets still are afraid of democracy and openness despite more than three years of reform. `` We talk about political transformations, but how difficult it is to part with the old power to which we are accustomed,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION>. `` We still can not imagine that genuine people's power will be simpler, more reliable and, of course, more responsible. Democracy, glasnost, and differences of opinion still frighten us, as if every one of us constantly lives in agreement with himself and always thinks in comfortable cliches,'' <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. `` Can you really call a person a person if he does n't have his own opinions?'' he said. His remarks to regional party officials were published by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> is regarded as a theoretician of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and the closest adviser to the Soviet president on the Politburo. He called for an end to `` wage-leveling,'' the practice of giving people the same pay regardless of the quality of the work they do. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged the practice of paying more for better work in an effort to get Soviets to work harder and produce better goods. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said that practice could be encouraged through the cooperative movement, which allows Soviets working privately to provide goods and services scarce in the state-run economy without adhering to the official price and wage structure. Without the concept of pay according to work, he said, `` the construction of socialism is a utopia; without it society, a person is alienated from property and power.'' <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said the new government structure approved last month will have to earn the respect of Soviet citizens. Last month, the Supreme Soviet parliament approved <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan for a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will include members selected from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions and other organizations The new congress in turn will choose a smaller, more active Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan also calls for a stronger presidency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1985, has said economic restructuring is needed in Soviet society. He also has espoused glasnost, or greater openness on selected issues.

<HEAD>Outgoing Pentagon Chief Urges Tower To Fight For Budget Boost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice as defense secretary, should let recent reforms to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s weapon-buying system take hold instead promising more sweeping changes, says outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> Tower also should fight as hard as he can for a 2 percent increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget _ and not talk about accepting less _ because anything less jeopardizes the nation's security and the future of the all-volunteer force, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` The last thing the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs is somebody to come in and yank the procurement system out by the roots again and say we're going to reform it or change it,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` The best reform for the procurement system is stability, predictability. The blueprint is laid out ... we've made a large number of changes in the procurement system. Real changes are taking place in the procurement system and I am proud of them.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was interviewed last week in his Pentagon office as he awaited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement of the man who would replace him. The 58-year-old defense chief, who said he was looking forward to finding a job in the private sector but had yet to do so, talked at length about what he considered his achievements, as well as the problems he foresaw for Tower. Of the former, he claimed a measure of credit for: _ Guiding the process and setting priorities in late 1987 in slashing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget plans to comply with a White House deficit compromise with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` We took it -LRB- cuts -RRB- in places the services did n't like and lost a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the process,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, referring to the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> over a decision to retire 16 warships. _ Protecting reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted he had just returned from a visit to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` and our standing could not be higher.'' `` The fact is that we got a high degree of cooperation from the moderate Arab states. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> -LRB- work -RRB- has been a major achievement.'' _ Taking a calm, measured approach to the disclosure of a wide-ranging fraud investigation among Pentagon contractors and private consultants <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had instituted a `` total quality management program'' to impress on contractors the need for quality products as well as ethical conduct. `` We're looking at more innovative ways to base competition on quality and track record as opposed to pure price,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary also cited success in `` establishing a good rapport'' with his Soviet counterparts; impressing upon leaders around the world the dangers posed by the proliferation of long-range missiles; convincing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation allowing obsolete military bases to be closed, and getting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> through a `` silly season'' earlier this year when some politicians were demanding the military be used to seal the nation's borders against drugs. `` We've got the <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> role in drug interdiction sorted out in a way that it is manageable, instead of having us seal the borders in 45 days or whatever the hell it was and shoot everybody who comes in.'' On the problem side, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tower would have to fight for a larger <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget; help develop arms control strategy, and strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> while helping <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies resist `` the seductive appeal of Soviet arms control proposals.'' If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Tower ca n't convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve a 2 percent real growth increase in the fiscal 1990 budget, the only way to make further cuts `` sensibly'' would be to reduce the size of the armed forces, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. If <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> deployments are lengthened, or tours for soldiers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> increased, `` what does that do for recruitment and retention?'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> asked. `` It's not a question of we ca n't afford it. If you look at the domestic programs, they continue to go up at a rate of about 8 percent. Therefore, using that yardstick, I see nothing wrong with 2 percent in defense.'' Asked then if he thought a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would actually go along with an increase, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> replied: `` Certainly if you do n't try, it's not politically do-able With the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, my view is that you've got to make your case.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for the last 14 months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said he had enjoyed the position but found it truly was `` a full-time job.'' `` On a per-hour basis, I make about as much as my babysitter,'' he joked, adding the secretary's salary of $ 99,500 is `` lousy.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to establish dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ends 13 years of officially shunning the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a period which began not long after its leader visited the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> toting a gun. But with the long and bitter tug of war over whether to talk to each other ended, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now begin a debate over peace itself as a wary <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> watches. The existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ its right to exist as a nation _ was at the heart of the American cold shoulder. That policy was halted last week when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> finally said the right words in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, meeting a three-step test set by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He renounced terrorism. He accepted guidelines set by two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions which implicity recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and hold out the prospect for land-for-peace negotiations. And, casting aside previous ambiguities, he recognized `` the right of all parties concerned in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict to exist in peace and security ... including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> had previously rejected other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> formulations, including a declaration by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> parliament in exile, and in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speech. But when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> revised his statements a day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> promptly ended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of shunning all substantive contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and said dialogue would begin. It was a far call from the November 1974 day when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, a pistol strapped to his hip, walked to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> podium in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to declare: `` I have come bearing an olive branch, and a freedom fighter's gun.'' Or the day in August 1979 when <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> resigned as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after holding unauthorized talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives. The no-talk policy was established in 1975 by then-Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. The two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions which <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> demanded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accept sprang from wars <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had fought against invading <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors. Resolution 242 was adopted after the 1967 war in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> territories. It decries acquisition of territory by war and speaks of `` the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every state in the area can live in peace and security.'' The resolution calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to remove its forces from occupied territories and for <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to respect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s independence. Resolution 338, adopted during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, called for a cease-fire and implementation of Resolution 242. Both resolutions speak of a negotiated settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was created by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 by welding together a number of competing Palestinian groups, including <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatah </PERSON>. By 1970, it was conducting guerilla and terrorist war against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from bases inside neighboring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in 1970 used his army to expel the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and its major elements moved to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ upsetting that country's delicate Christian-Muslim balance and helping ignite the Lebanese civil war Terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> continued across <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southern border and in June 1982 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded, hoping to expel the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. At that time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> help in evacuating Americans but officials said no substantive talks were involved. On Sept. 1, 1982, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces supervised the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s evacuation of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the organization moved to its current headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terrorist attacks continued through most of the 1980s and in October 1985 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blamed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> elements for the attack on the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> during which <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>, an American Jew confined to a wheelchair, was murdered. Despite worldwide condemnation of such acts, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> found growing support for its ultimate aim, the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the occupied territories. Arab leaders in 1972 had declared the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the only legitimate representative of Palestinians and two years later the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officially recognized the organization, granting it observer status. Although no official contacts were allowed, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was permitted to open an information office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices on grounds the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was a `` terrorist'' group. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attempt to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office ended up in court and the case has not been resoloved. Last month <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> refused to allow <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terrorist activities, a move that led to the shift of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. But 18 days after he denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> the visa, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to open `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy that brought exultation in the Arab world and shock and disappointment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Guatemalan farm workers have sent word back home that this dusty community east of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> is the promised land, prompting a torrent of refugees that some locals want to stop. `` Everyone told me there is work in the fields here every day of the year,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON>, 26, who arrived this month after picking crops in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` This is where I want to stay forever.'' But the last thing many longtime residents of this low-income farming community want is more Guatemalans. With the town's population of 5,500 already made up of nearly 3,000 Guatemalans, some residents are grumbling about the competition for jobs, the possible drain on public services and the feeling that `` they'' are taking over. `` The resentment against them is building,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON>, owner of a fertilizer business and outgoing president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's simply too many here for the town to absorb.'' Still more Guatemalans, mostly <ORGANIZATION> Kanjobal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> who speak a dialect even <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> speakers from their own country ca n't understand, flow into <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION> to escape the violence in their Central American homeland Word of mouth and letters from relatives and friends already here send out the message that year-round jobs providing free transportation are plentiful for those willing to pick oranges, grapefruits, tomatoes, cucumbers and cabbage. Smugglers called `` coyotes'' charge the Guatemalans upwards of $ 1,000 to sneak them across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Federal officials say about 300 to 400 Guatemalans cross the border in this way each day. The `` coyotes'' charge an additional $ 500 to transport refugees to farms in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, most to <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Immokalee </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials, who estimate 30,000 to 40,000 Guatemalans are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, say most who entered illegally have applied for amnesty to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. New immigration policies enacted this week may slow the flood of Central Americans into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The measure would sharply limit the number of people granted asylum. But the flood has already swamped <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION>. `` The blacks that live around here used to get all the work, but the farms want those Guatemalans,'' said <PERSON> Stetson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, a cabbage farm work contractor. `` Guatemalans are the hardest damn workers I've ever seen. They're like machines.'' Often criticized for its role in helping the Guatemalans settle in <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which began its efforts with the first arrivals in 1982. It operates a refugee school, a thrift shop and a service center to help new arrivals complete immigration papers, learn English and find housing. `` If the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to help them, let's help them in their own country,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, ranking officer of the <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's substation in <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION>. Church officials `` create problems by giving them legal assistance.'' Church workers say the 30 refugees who arrive every month are diligent, gentle people who are n't being given a chance by an intolerant community. `` There has always been resistance in <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION>. It's not a place that adapts well to change,'' said <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a staff member at the church service center. `` It was the same way when blacks came and Mexicans came,'' she said. `` They love them out picking the oranges, but they do n't like to see them walking around the street.'' Other church workers remember when actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> donated a bus for the refugee school in 1985, and days later it was pelted with rocks by white teen-agers. Many of the refugee families live in an area called Blue Camp consisting of rows of tiny shacks and one-room apartments, often without electricity or running water. With no public housing in <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION>, some landlords charge the Guatemalans as much as $ 300 a month. The refugee area has been the site of a 20 percent increase in police and emergency calls in the past year, county officials said. The most serious crime came last month when a Guatemalan was arrested in the rape of 5-year-old boy. `` It's usually never anything big _ lots of fights, wife beating _ and it can normally be traced to alcohol,'' said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` They drink like crazy. That, more than anything, turns people here against them.'' At the tiny post office, where refugees send money home so family members can make the trip, the postmaster refuses to help anyone who ca n't speak English or is not accompanied by an interpreter. `` They're in this country now _ they should learn how to speak the language,'' said Postmaster <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. Despite growing resentment among longtime residents, there have been no formal complaints from local governments against the Guatemalans, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Deputy District Director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldroup </PERSON>. `` I say they should all be rounded up and checked out,'' said <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` If they do n't belong here, they should be sent back to wherever they came from.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years ago, three days before Christmas, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> was getting ready for bed when the phone rang. It was a routine call for a medical examiner _ police had found two bodies. But there was nothing routine about the case that began unfolding that night, when <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> was called to the home of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> looked out a window and grimaced at the snow that was burying <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, then dressed warmly for the drive to <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> just east of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He walked into <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s ranch-style home and caught a whiff of trouble. `` It was the odor of death,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said, recalling that two evidence technicians had found two decaying bodies in the crawl space. `` I said, ` Oh brother, let's stop right here.' I was convinced there were more bodies. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> later drew a diagram on a piece of paper and showed that there were many, many bodies.'' In the crawl space alone, 29 bodies were found. Four more were dumped in nearby rivers. Ten years ago this week, <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> _ successful building contractor, decorated <PERSON> Jaycee </PERSON>, amateur clown, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activist _ became king of the mass murderers apprehended in this country. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> told police he strangled all but one of his 33 male victims by wrapping rope around their necks and twisting it with a stick. He had sex with some of them before killing them. The murders were committed over a three-year period beginning in 1975. In 1980, he was convicted of 33 murders _ more than anyone before or since. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, 46, received death sentences for 12 of the killings and life in prison for each of the remaining 21. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the convictions and the sentences. Execution is scheduled for Jan. 11, but is almost certain to be delayed by appeals. Illinois' last execution was in 1962. Today, <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> sits in a 46-square-foot cell on death row at <ORGANIZATION> Menard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, a small town in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He is allowed to exercise an hour a day and to spend another 60 minutes in the prison law library. `` He's not a disciplinary problem,'' says <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was painting landscapes the last time I saw him.'' <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s name surfaced briefly in this year's presidential campaign when a pamphlet distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> claimed that <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> would have been eligible for weekend passes had he committed his crimes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> under Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> labeled the pamphlet `` garbage,'' and <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> later wrote to state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials complaining about the `` sleazy'' tactic. At <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s request, corrections officials no longer relay oral requests for interviews. The uneasy memories of <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> and the crimes that stunned the world remain close to the surface. `` What I especially remember was the ghoulishness of people on the outside of the house,'' said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, who is still <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner and owns two <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> paintings. `` Just like counting down the seconds in a basketball game, they were counting up the bodies that were pulled from the ground.'' <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native, lived in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> before returning in the early 1970s to start his own business, specializing in remodeling work at retail stores. He often hired teen-age boys. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozenczak </PERSON>, chief of detectives in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> who is now police chief, had been looking for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Piest </PERSON>, a 15-year-old who disappeared after telling his mother he was going to see <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> about a summer job. A few days later, the detective got a search warrant for <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s home `` We never suspected we were in the middle of mass murders _ we were looking for one kid,'' <PERSON> Kozenczak </PERSON> said. Eight of the bodies were so badly decomposed they were never identified. At a funeral where authorities hoped they might get clues to the identities by watching the mourners, this was the final prayer offered for them: `` Lord, you alone know the names of these brothers, names you have written on the palm of your hand. We praise and thank you for the gift of life you gave them. We are sorry for the violence which took away their mortal lives.''

 Two Norwegians trawling for shrimps in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> caught a World War II German Messerschmitt ME-109 fighter plane, the national <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Saturday.

The wings are hardly damaged, with its Iron Cross marks still clearly visible. The front of the cabin is smashed but the pilot's seat and machinegun are intact,'' the report said. ME-109s were widely used by the German Luftwaffe during World War II.

 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> spends years nurturing firs on his Christmas tree farm in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Across the river at a factory in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keen </PERSON> can snap out one in 10 minutes. They both represent rival camps in a multimillion-dollar industry fighting to win a place in the living rooms of some 61 million American households. On a cold December day, families bundle up for an outing on <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s farm; youngsters romp while their parents search for the perfect tree. `` People like to be sure they're getting a fresh tree,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who has grown trees for nine years. <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s trees sell from $ 3 to $ 5 a foot. For $ 40, he'll dig up a white pine and cover the roots in a burlap bag for replanting after Christmas. He charges $ 10 a foot to dig spruces. Forty miles away in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, Keen, plant manager of <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is finished with Christmas 1988. He's thinking about manufacturing trees for 1989 At <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, no Christmas carols are played over the loudspeaker to get workers in the holiday spirit. Keen has considered the idea but thinks some workers might find the music distracting. Besides, it's hard to hear anything above the racket of machinery as 160 workers twist pieces of flame-retardant polyvinyl chloride _ PVC _ together with green twine, making branches that are blue, green or a combination for spruce trees, and box them up. They also make wreaths and garlands. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> worries mostly about insects or bad weather. Keen's challenge is getting all the right pieces in a box Around the country, real trees have a slight edge over artificial ones, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. It says 38 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s households use real trees while 33 percent prefer the artificial kind. The remaining 29 percent have no trees. Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states _ including <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> _ but the majority come from a handful of states. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> are tied for first place, each growing 6 million annually, the association says. Other top producers are <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sales of real trees are expected to generate more than $ 34.1 million this year, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, executive director of the association, which does not collect figures for artificial tree sales. Sales of real trees have been healthy this season, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said, noting that growers in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are reporting increases of 15 percent to 20 percent over 1987. The number of `` choose-and-cut'' Christmas tree farms has grown from 1,000 in the 1960s to 5,000 today, he said. Real Christmas trees are selling for $ 3 to $ 5.25 a foot this year, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. Artificial trees cost from $ 20 to $ 50 for cheaper versions and from $ 80 to $ 300 for better quality ones. `` They wo n't know it's artificial unless you tell them,'' reads a tag on a 7.5-foot, soft-needled <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir at <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> that retails for $ 229, comes with a 10-year guarantee and has 75 individual branches. A 14-foot version sells for about $ 999 and has 5,624 branches. `` I tell our people how important it is to get every branch in the box,'' Keen said. `` If people are setting up a tree at Christmas time and they do n't have a pole or branches are missing, it's kind of depressing to the children.'' <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which has its home plant in <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has net sales in excess of $ 25 million, said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, vice president of finance. People are switching to artificial trees, he said, for safety and convenience. `` Tradition is an argument, but that's up to you. Real trees get needles in your vacuum cleaner. I do n't think you get them out of the carpet until spring,'' he said. `` With ours, it folds right up, goes into a carton and you can use it next year.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, having made a series of concessions to lure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into a dialogue, believes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is now isolated and an international conference to negotiate a comprehensive <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace is on the horizon. `` There is an international moral force facing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said Saturday. That moral pressure, he said, is what led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to change its policy. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s moves began last month when its parliament-in-exile, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, declared an independent Palestinian state based on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> then set about meeting all three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for opening talks with the organization. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had demanded that the organization clearly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renounce terrorism and accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize the right of all nations in the region to live within secure borders. When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday as not clear enough, he came back a day later with another, more explicit declaration. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> then abruptly reversed its longstanding policy of refusing to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and two days later opened what it called a dialogue _ not negotiations _ with the group. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s priority now, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters Saturday, is to `` push forward with the international conference to be held very soon.'' The change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position caused shock in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejects the idea of an international conference or any talks with what it calls a `` terrorist organization.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has opened a new era, an era of peace,'' <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said. `` The Israelis have failed to enter it. We put an agenda of peace on the table.'' The revival of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` peace process,'' moribund for the past two years, is a direct result of the yearlong `` intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that has resulted in more than 320 Palestinian deaths. Thirteen Israelis also have died. More than anything else, the rock-throwing youths in the streets of the territories and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tough response has won new sympathy for the Palestinian cause. As <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation that met with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <PERSON> Tunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, put it: `` We are here in the name of the intefadeh.'' American officials in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> refused to make any substantive comment about the 90-minute meeting Friday, refering all queries to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But in the Palestinian view, there is no distinction between `` dialogue'' and `` negotiations.'' They say the talks, whatever they are called, mean recognition of Palestinian rights. The only suitable framework for working out an overall <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace, the Palestinians say, is the long-discussed international conference, involving all parties directly concerned, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our impression is that the Americans are serious, and that they understand that this dialogue should lead to a comprehensive peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> talks. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now could be neutral in its peace efforts. `` We started this dialogue according to their -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- desire,'' the chairman said. `` We will continue with this attitude because we know that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is one of two superpowers, and also one of five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. No peace can be settled without their participation and their efforts.'' The Palestinians say the next U.S.-PLO meeting will not take place until after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office Jan. 20. Both <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON> said they expected an international peace conference to get under way `` soon,'' though neither said when. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s acceptance of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 in <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON>'s words, `` the passport to the international conference.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now has the official ear of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and is counting on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to get the attention of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The decision for war or peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, not in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reagan To Focus On Budget After Presidency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged today to work on reforming the nation's budget process after leaving office, calling the effort a `` vital campaign.'' `` The budget system simply has no control and no internal discipline. And that's the problem,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office. With less than five weeks left in his presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used his five-minute address to argue once again that the president needs greater authority to limit spending in order to curtail the country's deficit. In the 1988 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, a $ 155.1 billion deficit was recorded. Under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law, a $ 100 billion deficit target has been set for the 1990 fiscal year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for getting the nation into its red ink dilemma, saying, `` Every dime of deficit spending has been mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Emphasizing that he believes the deficit can be solved without raising taxes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said such spending woes could be avoided if a laundry list of changes in the budget process were enacted. The president has argued repeatedly during his White House tenure for the proposals, such as the presidential authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills, a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, and granting the president authority not to spend money that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated, among others. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must reform its faulty budget process and we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so that the federal government does not spend more than it takes in,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` After I leave office next month, I will campaign for these reforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaign for the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve these reforms, the deficit will be ancient history in no time,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is required under the law to submit another budget on Jan. 9, and it is expected that he will include his budget reform recommendations in that spending plan. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the option of scrapping <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s entire budget if he wants and submitting his won proposal after he takes office Jan. 20 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has declined to say whether he will submit his own plan, but has said he wants to open negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over ways to reduce the deficit.

 <LOCATION> KHAO-I-DANG </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> refugees who lost their limbs in a decade of war against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> competed in a special athletic competition on Saturday, pushing themselves to the limit on crutches and wheelchairs. A young man with a wooden right leg jogged into a soccer field with a torch to inaugurate the event at this refugee camp, where 55 disabled veterans competed in 11 sports. Most are the victims of landmines strewn over vast areas of embattled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Several thousand refugees watched the games, standing or sitting in the dirt of this camp of bamboo and thatch-roof huts at the base of a mountain in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Prachinburi </LOCATION>. For the second straight year, <PERSON> Suk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, 22, won the dash on crutches, leaving his closest competitor far behind on the dirt-swept field. The guerrilla soldier lost his leg in 1986, when a mine exploded as he was fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978. `` Sports keep you healthy, and I participated for the honor of my camp,'' said the mild-mannered young man. `` I felt very sorry about losing my leg, but I realized that many other people lost their limbs too, and I was doing my duty to my country.'' <PERSON> Suk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> said that after he lost his leg, fighting prevented him from being evacuated from the front for six months. <PERSON> Ching </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>, 29, who won the wheelchair race, lost both legs to a landmine in a fierce 1982 battle for <PERSON> Pnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Malai </PERSON>, opposite the central Thai border. `` I thought I would be No. 1 in a wheelchair, and I wanted to find out if I would succeed,'' said Ching Pan. Prizes for the winners included scarves, T-shirts, books, sweets and other items donated by foreign relief workers. The fourth annual competition was organized by Operation Handicap International, the French-based agency that sponsors rehabilitation services for thousands of handicapped refugee in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border. The athletes competing Saturday were brought to Khao-I-Dang from other U.N.-aided refugee camps. <PERSON> Khao-I-Dang </PERSON> is neutral, but the other camps are controlled by <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas, including the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the forces of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s former leader, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> allowed athletes to leave only its Site 8 camp, which is U.N.-sponsored. Aid officials say the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who killed hundreds of thousands when they led <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1975-78, are holding refugees as virtual captives in their three other camps. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which has promised to withdraw its 120,000 troops by 1990, is supporting the Cambodian government against the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other rebels. `` -LRB- The guerrillas -RRB- are all separated for political reasons, but some of the refugees do n't care about these differences,'' said <PERSON> Myriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtart </PERSON>, a Belgian medical coordinator for Operation Handicap and an Olympics organizer. `` All these people are within the same walls here and there is no fighting. They just enjoy the games.'' <PERSON> Houtart </PERSON> said the handicapped tend to be separated from the other refugees. She said some camp administrators give the amputees special food and other items, but `` after that, they do n't want to hear about them any more.''

 For <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the Godfather of Soul, Soul Brother No. 1, the self-proclaimed Pope of Music, it has finally come to this: six years in a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> prison for trying to run over two policemen. Just two years after a comeback run, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s life is a mess. The man praised by presidents for his good works can not stay out of trouble. The singer of love ballads was charged this year with trying to kill his wife; it's his third tumultuous marriage. The crusader against drugs apparently has a PCP habit. `` Obviously, there is trouble within the confines of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the man,'' his attorney, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said last week. `` It's unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Flash'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, who worked for the singer-businessman's three radio stations in the 1970s, before <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> lost the stations and much of what he owned in tax and other money troubles. `` I ca n't imagine anything like this happening to him,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said Friday from <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, the day his friend checked into prison. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 55, has shown little sign of slowing down, either on or off the stage. He still performs around the world. He still makes records. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was arrested at least seven times in the past year and a half, including twice in a bizarre 20 hours in September that culminated in Thursday's sentence in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> On Sept. 24, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> led police on a two-state chase until they shot out his tires. According to blood tests, he was strung out on PCP, a hallucinogen known as `` angel dust.'' After posting bond, he was arrested for drunken driving. His trial in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on 10 misdemeanors stemming from the chase is scheduled for Jan. 23. `` This is not the real <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, his attorney of four years. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s problems, he said, `` originated during a time of domestic difficulties'' with his wife, <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON>. `` He just ca n't get it to smooth out. `` I programmed three radio stations for him,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> recalled. `` He did n't allow anything like that. If you even had any alcohol or anything like that, you lost your job. I do n't know what has happened to him.'' Long-time employee <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Daviss </PERSON> saw him in September. `` He had passed the point of no return,'' <PERSON> Daviss </PERSON> said. `` He had trouble speaking. His wife was hiding the car keys from him. I pleaded with her to get him some help.'' In the past, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> made it on his own. Jailed for auto theft at 15, the former shoeshine boy got out and formed a singing group that became his Famous Flames. In 1956, he released `` Please, Please, Please.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was on his way. A string of hits _ `` I Got You -LRB- I Feel Good -RRB-,'' `` Papa's Got A Brand New Bag,'' `` Cold Sweat'' _ defined 1960s soul music. With frenetic, repeating guitar rhythms, bullet-sharp horn blasts and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s inimitable yowls and growls, nothing before _ or since _ sounded like it. With his sweat, his jet-black pompadour and his constant shuffling, leg-splitting dancing, nobody looked like <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, either. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> took a step toward the political with songs such as `` Say It Loud _ I'm Black And I'm Proud,'' and his influence was large. His TV appearances following the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION> were credited by President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> with helping avoid further violence. He urged kids not to get messed up in drugs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> later tried to ride the disco tide, with only partial success. Financial problems followed. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says he still owes $ 6 million. But the late'80s brought nostalgia for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s music. And unlike many rock legends, the Godfather of Soul was still out there working. His `` Living In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' from the film `` Rocky IV,'' won a Grammy in 1987, his second. But 1987 also saw <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s life beginning to crack. He was getting arrested, for driving violations, assaulting police, drugs. Before, he had gotten probation and fines. Not this time in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> courtroom. `` I do n't want to take too much of your time, sir,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Aiken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` But I'm fighting for my life. `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the man, wants to do right,'' he continued. `` I've wanted to do right all my life I'll do anything I can not to go to prison, so I can continue my work.'' `` I've considered that you've done a lot of good,'' the judge said. `` But I've got to consider some of the bad.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 18 months _ earlier, if he behaves himself. `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is a survivor,'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said. `` We have not even touched the depths of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> yet. This is a setback. It is not the end. I do n't think people want it to be the end.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended Saturday that the nation's deficit could be `` ancient history in no time'' if the president had more power over the budget process. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who leaves office in less than five weeks, used his weekly radio address to blame <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> once again for the nation's deficit spending habits `` Every dime of deficit spending has been mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the address, delivered from the Oval Office. `` Under the Constitution, only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can spend money; the president ca n't appropriate a penney,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

Under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law, a $ 100 billion deficit target has been set for the 1990 fiscal year. `` The verdict is in.

Saying, `` The only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the increases in spending,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his final budget will reduce the deficit target by some $ 35 billion for the 1990 fiscal year and meet the Gramm-Rudman target. The president also contended that his budget plan will do so `` without touching Social Security or raising taxes.'' `` Economic growth will increase revenues by $ 80 billion without new taxes.

 No, I'm not asking you to pay more taxes. I think you already pay plenty, and those trying to tax away more of your hard-earned money should be ashamed of themselves. Instead what I need is for you to help me fix a budget system that has broken down. First let me describe the problem, and then I'll tell you what we can do about it. The record is not good. In all but eight of the last 56 years the federal government has run a deficit, and every dime of deficit spending over these many years has been mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. You see, under the Constitution, only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can spend money. The president ca n't appropriate a penny. Up until 1974, the president did have one effective way to control spending. He could refuse to spend money appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and this ability to impound funds was routinely used by such presidents as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. In fact three of my predecessors _ Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> _ used this power each year to reduce federal spending by between five and eight percent. During my presidency, that would have reduced the deficit by billions each year. But all that changed in 1974. In the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stripped the President of his ability to refuse to spend funds. Let me try to describe the effect of this change. Suppose the rules of hockey were changed and the goalie was removed from the game. Would you be surprised if hockey scores quadrupled? Well since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the budget law, federal spending has in fact quadrupled and it has come right out of your pocket. And under the new rules the deficit has taken off. For a quarter century, the average annual federal deficit was just seven-tenths of one percent of Gross National Product. Then in the mid-1970s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the rules and since then the deficit has been running five times higher than before. The verdict is in. The current system does not work. Can you imagine if a head of a household or a business were forced to spend every dime that was budgeted even if savings were available? Well that's the situation the president is in now. All he can do is ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take back funds it appropriated. Since 1982, I have requested <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take back unneeded funds more than 460 times and 83 percent of the time they refused. Most of the time they did n't even bring it up for a vote. They simply said, `` No, spend it all.'' During my two terms, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated over $ 100 billion more on domestic spending than I requested. But this is typical. Between 1976 and 1987, a period spanning three presidents in which we ran a deficit each year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spent an average of $ 30 billion per year more than the president requested. The budget system simply has no control and no internal discipline, and that's the problem. Now here's what must be done. To solve the deficit problem it is essential that we restore the constitutional balance and repair the system. We need to give the president greater authority to limit spending; that means the line-item veto which 43 governors have, and also greater authority for a president to return unneeded funds to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must reform its faulty budget process, and we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so the federal government does not spending more than it takes in. After I leave office next month I will campaign for these reforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaign for the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve these reforms, then a deficit will be ancient history in no time. What wo n't solve the problem is raising taxes. In fact, over the last 40 years the record is this; on average, every $ 100 of new taxes has led to $ 158 of new spending. And since 1981, yearly tax revenues have gone up sharply by some $ 375 billion, but that has n't balanced the budget because spending has gone up $ 450 billion, and less than one-third of that went for defense Yes we've heard a lot about cuts, but by there terms, even when spending goes up they call it a cut. For example Medicare spending, which we've been charged with cutting, in fact has doubled. The only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the increase in spending, and that's what my last budget will do. Without touching Social Security or raising taxes, our fiscal year 1990 budget will reduce the deficit by some $ 35 billion _ more than meeting the Gramm-Rudman target. You see, economic growth will increase revenues by $ 80 billion without new taxes. Just by holding spending increases to less than $ 80 billion we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track for a balanced budget by 1993 and with your help that will be done. Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has five weeks to go until he assumes command, but his offhand remarks and news-conference performances are providing an early glimpse into the policies and style he is likely to pursue as chief executive. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has backed off one campaign pledge completely: his promise to name Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to head the nation's drug enforcement effort. And he has modified other campaign positions in light of changing political realities, such as his vow to not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In the area of relations with the Soviets, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has displayed more caution than was evident in his campaign utterances, urging a go-slow approach both toward a summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and to new talks to cut strategic arms. And on the federal budget, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been shifting his stance: first hinting that he would not submit his own budget this winter, then saying that he recognized he must take the initiative. In areas of style, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has displayed a certain zest in his frequent encounters with reporters and has suggested he will hold more frequent news conferences than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But he also issued a warning: no more answering of shouted questions at photo-taking sessions once he takes office _ a tactic that had become a standard practice of reporters covering the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. Meanwhile, the vice president has been meeting with scores of individuals and organization in an effort to reach out to friend and former foe alike, including meetings defeated rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the Coretta <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the widow of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. During his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped to have a summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as soon as possible after he takes office However, on Friday, answering questions after announcing his selection of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` there is no expectation that we will or wo n't'' have such an early session _ saying he did n't want to send the wrong signal and appear over hasty. A few days earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he plans to move slowly in arms talks with the Soviets and said `` there is no way'' his administration would have a detailed program on arms talks by a scheduled Feb. 5 date for the resumption of talks. `` It will be a different kind of White House. It's going to be brimming with kids, a very uplifting kind of family setting. In terms of style, I think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be closer to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a moderate Republican. `` He's going to be very hands-on and involved. Capitol Hill has been increasingly frustrated in dealing with a disengaged president. I think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will have a very positive attitude,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> continued. But <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is trying to balance and juggle in the transition, as he did in the campaign, two very different personalities.'' `` One is the tough, hard-nosed, ` read my lips, make my day' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> That's the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who basically says, we've got to take it easy with the Soviets. We're not going to rush to judgement on a -LRB- strategic arms limitation treaty -RRB- with the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` The other is the kinder and gentler, thousand points of light, to reach out to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, to various groups <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the one who writes who writes little notes to everybody. `` He's managed to juggle the two personalities very adroitly. But I ` m not sure it's going to be as easy to do once he's inaugurated,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> added. After vowing repeatedly to make his vice president a drug czar in his administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent days has suggested he wo n't, saying to do so would `` circumvent a law'' passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that requires him to name someone other than the vice president to such a post. On the subject of one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pet projects, the `` Star Wars'' Strategic Defense Initiative, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has reiterated his support for the program to shield the nation against incoming nuclear missiles. But, just as in the campaign, there was still some ambivalence to the vice president's commitment to the plan _ heightened by comments by Tower on Friday suggesting SDI's usefulness as a bargaining `` lever'' in dealing with the Soviets. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has voiced support for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration decision to open talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> _ a decision that spares him from having to make the tough call but means the talks will proceed on his watch. At the same time, he has indicated skepticism and caution, telling reporters, `` I honestly do n't know where it will lead.'' `` I would n't overstate the importance of this in terms of the formulation of our own <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week. But, asked whether he would pursue a campaign demand that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> change its covenant to eliminate language supporting the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he would not. `` I do n't want to set the clock back,'' he said. On other issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to decline to spell out where he would make cuts to trim the federal budget deficit, brushing aside specific questions on what he would do for the homeless and how he would pay for refurbishing antiquated nuclear weapons plants. On farm programs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared `` I do n't believe we are going to balance the budget eventually on the backs of the farmers,'' but went on to say he favored allowing `` more market forces that lead to lower supports and lower subsidies.'' On trade issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated that he would continue recent <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of firing `` rifle shot'' trade sanctions at economic allies that discriminate against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods to `` show our determination to have fair trade and equal access.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address: My fellow Americans, today I want to ask you a question. Will you help me to reduce the federal budget deficit and then balance the budget once and for all? No, I'm not asking you to pay more taxes. I think you already pay plenty, and those trying to tax away more of your hard-earned money should be ashamed of themselves. Instead what I need is for you to help me fix a budget system that has broken down. First let me describe the problem, and then I'll tell you what we can do about it. The record is not good. In all but eight of the last 56 years the federal government has run a deficit, and every dime of deficit spending over these many years has been mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. You see, under the Constitution, only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can spend money. The president ca n't appropriate a penny. Up until 1974, the president did have one effective way to control spending. He could refuse to spend money appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and this ability to impound funds was routinely used by such presidents as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. In fact three of my predecessors _ Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> _ used this power each year to reduce federal spending by between five and eight percent. During my presidency, that would have reduced the deficit by billions each year. But all that changed in 1974. In the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stripped the President of his ability to refuse to spend funds. Let me try to describe the effect of this change. Suppose the rules of hockey were changed and the goalie was removed from the game. Would you be surprised if hockey scores quadrupled? Well since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the budget law, federal spending has in fact quadrupled and it has come right out of your pocket. And under the new rules the deficit has taken off. For a quarter century, the average annual federal deficit was just seven-tenths of one percent of Gross National Product. Then in the mid-1970s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the rules and since then the deficit has been running five times higher than before. The verdict is in. The current system does not work. Can you imagine if a head of a household or a business were forced to spend every dime that was budgeted even if savings were available? Well that's the situation the president is in now. All he can do is ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take back funds it appropriated. Since 1982, I have requested <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take back unneeded funds more than 460 times and 83 percent of the time they refused. Most of the time they did n't even bring it up for a vote. They simply said, `` No, spend it all.'' During my two terms, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated over $ 100 billion more on domestic spending than I requested. But this is typical. Between 1976 and 1987, a period spanning three presidents in which we ran a deficit each year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spent an average of $ 30 billion per year more than the president requested. The budget system simply has no control and no internal discipline, and that's the problem. Now here's what must be done. To solve the deficit problem it is essential that we restore the constitutional balance and repair the system. We need to give the president greater authority to limit spending; that means the line-item veto which 43 governors have, and also greater authority for a president to return unneeded funds to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must reform its faulty budget process, and we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so the federal government does not spending more than it takes in. After I leave office next month I will campaign for these reforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaign for the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve these reforms, then a deficit will be ancient history in no time. What wo n't solve the problem is raising taxes. In fact, over the last 40 years the record is this; on average, every $ 100 of new taxes has led to $ 158 of new spending. And since 1981, yearly tax revenues have gone up sharply by some $ 375 billion, but that has n't balanced the budget because spending has gone up $ 450 billion, and less than one-third of that went for defense Yes we've heard a lot about cuts, but by there terms, even when spending goes up they call it a cut. For example Medicare spending, which we've been charged with cutting, in fact has doubled. The only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the increase in spending, and that's what my last budget will do. Without touching Social Security or raising taxes, our fiscal year 1990 budget will reduce the deficit by some $ 35 billion _ more than meeting the Gramm-Rudman target. You see, economic growth will increase revenues by $ 80 billion without new taxes. Just by holding spending increases to less than $ 80 billion we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track for a balanced budget by 1993 and with your help that will be done. Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 Thousands of buzzards have come back to winter in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but some people complain that the ugly birds with a wingspan of up to 6 feet have returned in unprecedented numbers. `` We joke and say, ` The birds are coming, the birds are coming,''' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, a resident of the Township condominium complex. But he says the birds are no longer a joke because they have come in such numbers. They dine at dumps, soar over parks, congregate at high-rises and even visit some of the mansions in tony <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` When they fly, they look like something out of <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> resident. `` They're taking over,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON>, president of the Township's Applewood Village I condominium association. `` It's frightening,'' she said, despite reassurances that vultures are considered harmless They are known to eat only garbage and the flesh of dead creatures. The condo's proximity to a landfill near <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> may be its attraction. `` We can hear them bouncing around on the roof at night,'' said <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackman </PERSON>, who lives on the top floor of a Township building. `` Sometimes they go at each other. That's making love, I guess.'' `` We love Mother Nature, but this is too much,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON>, another Township resident. `` They sit and preen their feathers,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the landfill near <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` There are hundreds of them here. They hang out and pick through the garbage.'' Shooting the birds is out because the destruction of wildlife and migratory birds is against federal and state laws. <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON> built a fashionable scarecrow on the lawn near his building. `` I built a scarecrow in Christian Dior clothes,'' said the retired Dior distribution manager. The creation worked on some of the buzzards, but <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON> says when a maintenance worker knocked it down by accident, the birds attacked and tore it apart. `` I guess they thought it had died,'' <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON> said. `` This time I'm going to build one and dress it in <LOCATION> Levis </LOCATION>.''

 Sinhalese militants, accused of killing more than 430 people in the past month, set fire to a bus Saturday and threw a firebomb at a shop in attempts to spread terror two days before presidential elections, police and witnesses said. Three people were injured in the bomb attack, witnesses said on conditon of anonymity. Also Saturday, security forces shot and killed a suspected Sinhalese radical and the bodies of four other suspected radicals were found in the last 24 hours, officials said. There was no word on who killed the four. No one was hurt in the bus fire in the center of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, but the flames engulfed three nearby shops, a police official said. He also spoke on condition of anonymity. Witnesses said a gang of militants entered the parked bus, sprinkled gasoline and set it on fire. Sinhalese militants also hurled a firebomb at a shop opposite the city's main train station, other witnesses said. At least three people were injured in the attack, they said. The attacks prompted authorities to move up a night curfew on the island by one hour. The curfew now is to start at 8 p.m. Saturday and end at 5 a.m. Sunday. Officials say Sinhalese militants have killed more than 430 people since Nov. 16 in an attempt to disrupt Monday's balloting. Cabinet minister <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that 405 people were killed by the militants between Nov. 16 and Thursday in Sinhalese-dominated central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The 168-member Parliament then voted 65-2 to extend emergency laws in effect since 1983. At least 26 people were killed by the militants since Thursday, military officials said on condition of anonymity. The killings are a part of a campaign of violence aimed at disrupting presidential elections scheduled for Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main militant Sinhalese group, has called for a boycott of the polls, claiming they will not be conducted fairly The group, which has called for the dismissal of the government and organized a series of crippling strikes, says the government gave too many concessions in a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old insurrection by guerrillas of the minority Tamil community. Members of the front have been blamed for bomb attacks on meetings of opposition presidential candidates <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonasekara </PERSON>. Two bombs exploded at a public meeting Friday addressed by Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, a former prime minister and leader of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. She was unhurt. <PERSON> Abeygoonasekara </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> composed of four leftist parties, has survived three assassination attempts since he announced his candidacy last month. The polls will elect a successor to President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who by law can not be elected to a third term. His <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has put up Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. Sinhalese form 75 percent of the island's 16 million people. Tamils make up 18 percent of the population. Tamil rebels have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland on the island's north and east, claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese in jobs and education. At least 8,500 people have died in the separatist war.

<TEXT>
 Every morning, when people return to the streets of this town after a dusk-to-dawn curfew, the talk is of bodies: how many were found, whether the victims' names are known, how they died. Like the rest of the population of this tropical island once known as an ideal of democracy, <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>'s residents are to vote Monday for a new president. Although voting is only hours away, they speak not of ballots but of bullets, charred bodies and people who disappear in the night. `` Have you seen the body at <LOCATION> Katuwana </LOCATION> village?'' asked <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>. `` It is almost burnt beyond recognition.'' Bodies of young Sinhalese men have been found almost every day for the last two weeks, according to the people of <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION> and other towns along the south coast. <PERSON> Anula </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamage </PERSON>, a 26-year-old mother of three in <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, often slips out of her house at night to see whether more bodies have been dumped by the roadside _ and whether her husband is among the victims She said he was taken away on Nov. 12 by armed men in civilian clothing. Villagers blame government troops for the killings. They accuse the troops of rounding up people suspected of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese radical group that has vowed to disrupt the elections and kill anyone who supports a government peace plan for ending a 5-year-old insurrection by members of the Tamil minority. Military officials deny the allegations. They say the killings are spontaneous civilian retaliations against the front, which the government blames for the deaths of more than 600 people since the peace accord was signed July 29, 1987. The front has accused President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> of selling out his own Sinhalese community, which comprises 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, in attempts to make peace with the Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the population. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, barred by the constitution from seeking a third term, has fielded his prime minister, <PERSON> Ransinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premedasa </PERSON>, to represent his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Extremists have killed members of the incumbent party, as well as supporters of the other two major candidates, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonesekera </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, a bomb went off at <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s final campaign rally, injuring three people. No one knows for sure how many people have disappeared or been killed for their suspected links with the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. But conversations with villagers indicate scores have died. Military officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said Friday that the bodies of eight suspected front members had been found in the last 24 hours in the Sinhalese heartland. They blamed the killings on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group unheard of a few weeks ago `` There were 62 bodies in Southern province in the last three days,'' said <PERSON> Mahinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajapakse </PERSON>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. `` Some of them were burned with tires to prevent identification.'' <PERSON> Rajapakse </PERSON>'s home is a magnet for those whose sons and husbands have vanished. He said he does not know how many are missing but said they number in `` the hundreds, maybe thousands.'' `` The men came in vehicles without license plates and took away my son, <PERSON> Amirth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nandasena </PERSON>,'' his mother wailed, sitting on the ground in her mud hut in <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Amirth </PERSON> was found later shot to death, his body dumped along the road a mile from her hut. Brig. <PERSON> Lakshman </PERSON> <PERSON> Algama </PERSON>, military coordination officer for Southern province which includes <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, denied security forces were responsible for the charred bodies. `` This is a new trend of revenge killings by relatives and friends who were earlier killed or harassed by the extremists,'' he said in an interview in <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>. An emergency government decree Nov. 9 gave the army the power to shoot on sight anyone demonstrating against the government or instigating strikes. Security forces subsequently were empowered to bury bodies without waiting for inquests. Government forces acknowledge they round up suspected radicals. <PERSON> Algama </PERSON> said 1,235 Sinhalese men were detained at <LOCATION> Boosa </LOCATION> prison near <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>. `` They have been apprehended in various police areas in the south and are sent here to go through a process of being screened, and then the innocents are released,'' <PERSON> Algama </PERSON> said. He claimed the security forces' actions would allow the country to choose a new president. `` We have created a climate for elections to be held,'' he said.

<HEAD>Papandreou Says He'll Resign if Parliament Rejects Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, whose socialist administration has been rocked by a financial scandal, said Saturday the government will resign if Parliament does not approve his 1989 budget. The 69-year-old premier told a nationwide television audience that he would consider a rejection of the nearly $ 28 billion budget a no-confidence vote in his socialist government. `` If not approved, the government will resign with all the consequences that would follow such an action'', he said. If the government resigns because of failure to win a majority in the vote scheduled for Sunday, general elections must be held within 45 days. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s speech came as rumors circulated through the Greek capital that the government was about to collapse because of a widening financial scandal. The scandal broke in October when opposition parties charged senior government officials of involvement in illegal deals allegedly set up by banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, who is accused of influence peddling, embezzlement and fraud. The deals allegedly involved _ directly or indirectly _ the prime minister and members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who is Minister of Education. Seven ministers have left the 59-member Cabinet as a result of the $ 300 million banking and arms scandal. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> Nov. 6 and has been arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, who ran a house-painting business in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 1974 to 1979, is also charged with attempting to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A hearing is scheduled in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Jan. 9. On Wednesday, Deputy Defense Minister <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON> <PERSON> Yiotas </PERSON> resigned, saying: `` I refuse as a member of this government to be associated with adventurers, swindlers and embezzlers of public money.'' Yiotas charged the directors of the Greek Arms Industry of paying commissions of millions of dollars for unfulfilled contracts to arms dealers hiding behind dummy companies. He also resigned his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and left the governing party's central committee. The scandal widened when a banking commissioner investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> said public service organizations had more than $ 133 million on deposit with the bank. Greek newspapers and opposition political parties accused officials working for the post office, telephone company and other public services of receiving interest rates above the legal limit from the bank and pocketing the difference. In his speech, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> charged `` domestic and foreign circles'' of `` undermining and orchestrating'' the overthrow of his socialist administration, basing `` their hopes in God that I would not return from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> underwent bypass cardiac surgery there on September 30. Political observers said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s speech appeared to be a warning to his deputies to adhere to the party line or _ if they failed to approve the government's budget _ be considered defectors. According to parliamentary procedure, lawmakers cast ballots by voice vote and therefore are hesitant to oppose party policy. His party controls 157 seats in the 300-member single-chamber <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party has 112 seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 12, and other parties, 19. Debate on the budget began Thursday and a vote is scheduled for Sunday. New Democracy, led by <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, has called on the government to resign and call elections.

<HEAD>Local Governments Soften Blow Of Having A Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local governments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, faced with growing peasant resistance to the one-child policy, are trying to soften the blow to families whose one child turns out to be a girl. A county in southeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province has set up an old-age insurance program for couples that have a girl and then agree to be sterilized, the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Another county in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province has set up a similar program with the local government and parents of girls jointly contributing to a pension fund, the paper said Monday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, seeking to control a population that already exceeds 1.08 billion, has mandated that most families can have only one child. But peasant families want boys to help in the fields and support them in their old age. For centuries girls have been regarded as a burden because once they become old enough to make money they marry into another family. As <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms have made peasants wealthier, more and more are willing to pay fines and have a second or third child if the first ones turn out to be girls. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also has acknowledged a growing problem of girl babies being aborted, killed at birth or abandoned, creating a sex ratio imbalance. The People's Daily said the new old-age insurance plans are designed to overcome the disadvantages of having a girl. In the <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> case, local governments and industries have donated to a fund that will be invested, and parents of girls who are sterilized can receive payments after they reach age 55. In <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, families can draw on the pension fund after 25 years. Women are under strong pressure from their husbands and in-laws to have sons. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> recently reported the case of a young woman in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> whose in-laws threw her out of the house because she had a girl. A survey of nearly 300 rural families in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province found that more girls than boys were born from 1977 to 1984, but that since 1984 the number of surviving boys babies has been nearly twice the number of girls. An official report on the survey said the mortality rate for baby girls was higher among the surveyed families than that for boys. In one effort to cope with the problem, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s family planning officials said in August they were beginning to allow peasant families whose first child was a girl to have a second one. However, local family planning officials remain under pressure from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to meet birth control quotas. The pension plans appear to be another approach to the problem.

As a result of <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>'s action, attorneys said Friday the case against defendant <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> must start over, and she may have to face trial and even a possible death sentence. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 27, is charged with the stabbing and beating death of the night manager of a suburban motel where she worked as a maid. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> had indicated at a pre-trial hearing with attorneys for both sides that he would sentence Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to 50 years in prison in exchange for a guilty plea, Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said that during the course of the plea Thursday, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> believed he heard some additional information about the crime and felt it might merit a stiffer sentence. `` Judge <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> recused himself ... and -LRB- the case -RRB- was reassigned'' to another judge,'' the prosecutor said. `` Recuse'' is a legal term meaning to withdraw because a judge or juror is prejudiced or otherwise incompetent to act. `` It's very unusual for this to happen. But the rules provide that this is how it's done,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON>. Under the agreement reached at the pre-trial conference, <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> said, his client escaped a trial and a possible death penalty had she been convicted. In disqualifying himself, however, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> also vacated Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' guilty plea, so the case essentially will start from scratch, <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> said. Both attorneys said they thought the details described in court Thursday were virtually the same as those told to the judge previously. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> declined to specify what made him change his mind. <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> said he is not bitter, even though the judge's action means his client could now face a trial. `` He's a conscientious and thoughtful kind of a judge,'' and felt he had no choice but to disqualify himself, <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> said. `` He followed the rules, if he's second-guessing himself on what he was going to do.'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is charged with murder, armed robbery and arson in the Feb. 15 death of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngjohns </PERSON>, 61. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is accused of using a rock, knife, and a heavy metal dustpan to kill Ms. <PERSON> Youngjohns </PERSON> in her motel office. Prosecutors say she then set the body on fire. A Jan. 4 hearing is scheduled, but <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> said he hopes an agreement can be reached with the new judge that will enable his client to avoid a trial.

 The writer-director of `` Platoon,'' `` Wall Street'' and `` Talk Radio,'' known for his angry film characters, says parenthood and marriage counseling have mellowed him. `` You probe your feelings and your relationship to your mom, your relationship to women, whether you're a misogynist or not,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said, adding, `` The issue came up: ` Why in your films do you treat -LRB- women negatively -RRB-?'' `` And I think there's some truth to it.

<TEXT>
 A song in memory of fallen police officers, written and recorded by a policeman who died two days later in an accident, has become the most popular song at the radio station where it debuted. The calls to WQIK-FM have n't stopped since the song `` When Daddy Comes Home'' was first played Friday. `` We have just been swamped on the phones,'' program director <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` It's been the most requested song of the day.'' Officer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinholser </PERSON>, 30, died Wednesday from injuries suffered when he was thrown from his motorcycle Tuesday night on his way to work. His funeral was Saturday. After <PERSON> Shinholser </PERSON>'s death, his 4-year-old son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s voice was added to the song, reciting the plaintive refrain, `` I miss you, Daddy. I miss you.'' `` That's it. That's the part that really gets to people,'' said Officer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shinholser </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>, the officer's manager and two fellow officers brought the first copy of the song's master tape to WQIK Thursday night. The song was inspired by the death of Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevel </PERSON>, who was fatally shot in May 1983. But the lyrics foreshadow the songwriter's own death, saying in part, `` Momma, when's Daddy coming home to hug his little man? <ORGANIZATION> WQIK </ORGANIZATION> news director <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> called the offices of syndicated radio commentator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> this week to relay the story; <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> opened his Thursday broadcast with <PERSON> Shinholser </PERSON>'s story. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said his office has received hundreds of calls from radio listeners wanting to buy the tape. Shinholser originally intended all proceeds to go toward the construction fund for a police memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said. Now, part of the profits will be placed in a college fund for <PERSON> Shinholser </PERSON>'s two children. The police union is producing tapes of the song.

 Tanks and soldiers that could be used for earthquake relief instead patrol <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, evidence that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> believes a show of force is still needed to keep a lid on nationalistic unrest. Already, dozens of Armenian activists have been jailed for alleged curfew violations. Other activists say, however, that the real reason for the arrest has been their continued political agitation. It was the activists' heated campaign for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s annexation of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> district in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that drew world attention to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> for most of the year. But the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> became the focus of the republic's 3.4 million people. The activists did not give up, however, and despite the government's avowed policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, it has launched a crackdown against them. Three days after the quake, while Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to check on disaster relief, five leaders of the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> committee, an activist group, were arrested. Another leader was arrested later, and the other five are now reported in hiding. The unsanctioned group has spearheaded the annexation campaign, which has led to bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The Kremlin has refused to turn <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. During a visit to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blasted committee members as `` provocateurs'' trying to take advantage of the instability created by the earthquake. `` They must be stopped,'' he said. The Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, accused the militants of harming earthquake relief efforts. `` From a snug headquarters, the committee contacts hospitals with incompetent instructions, disseminates wild rumors and sends spurious data to the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, thus hampering the effort to organize effective medical aid to quake victims,'' <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> charged, according to a summary of the article carried Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. Some Armenians agree with some of the official criticism. <PERSON> Larisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gishiyan </PERSON>, 36, said the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> issue must remain a priority but that it `` should n't be brought up during mourning.'' But the activists believe the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> issue must not be put aside for anything. `` If a person dies in your home, you still must eat, breathe,'' said <PERSON> Ruzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, whose husband Mofses, an Armenian nationalist, was arrested Nov. 27 and sentenced to 30 days in jail. A Politburo commission overseeing earthquake relief said Saturday that <PERSON> Karbakh </PERSON> committee members were making `` instigatory talks'' and handing out leaflets calling for demonstrations and strikes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The activists' anger is increasingly directed at <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They say he was heckled and sworn at during his visit to the disaster area because of his handling of the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> issue, but those reports could not be independently confirmed. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Martirosyan </PERSON> of the Armenian group <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Determination </ORGANIZATION> have even claimed the destruction in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was caused not by an earthquake but by some government-run operation to punish the Armenian people. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- used a national tragedy for his goals,'' <PERSON> Martirosyan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Hacker Apologizes For Invading Weapons Laboratory Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hacker who browsed for weeks through the unclassified computer system of a top federal nuclear weapons laboratory has been identified and has apologized to authorities. No arrests have been made, officials said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and lab officials refused to identify the hacker. `` In a communication, he regretted the difficulty caused by his actions and agreed to stop accessing <ORGANIZATION> LLNL </ORGANIZATION> computers,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Garberson </PERSON>, spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. Lab officials had pleaded through local media for the hacker to contact them. The pleas led to several phone calls identifying possible suspects, but it was unclear if the identity of the hacker was discovered through a tip. A spokesman said earlier in the week that the hacker did not invade the lab's top secret nuclear weapons research computers, which are physically and electronically separated from the unclassified system. The lab, run by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, is one of the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons. The other is at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, N.M. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the case, spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garberson </PERSON> said because criminal charges may be filed, lab officials will not provide any further information. The hacker first appeared on the lab's Internet system about two weeks ago. The system connects research facilities and universities nationwide. The hacker accessed various computers at the lab and even gave himself `` super user'' status so he could roam through files. However, no data or files were destroyed. Lab officials described him as `` joy riding'' through the system to see what he could get into. He made at least 11 system trespasses, the last on Dec. 10. The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a computer `` virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by another hacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were through different holes in the system and there may yet be other access points that have not been patched.

<HEAD>Leaders Of Electricity Workers' Strike Sentenced To Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government tribunal has sentenced 11 officials to life imprisonment for calling a strike by workers at the national electricity utility that caused a four-day nationwide power outage. The tribunal sentenced the men Friday in the northern city of <LOCATION> Kaduna </LOCATION> after they were convicted of instigating the Oct. 5-8 blackout. The men are top officials of the staff association that represents the utility's senior officials, who struck to demand a review of their salaries and benefits as part of a plan to run the authority on a commercial basis. Authorities say the blackout caused untold hardships and many deaths in public hospitals. Justice <PERSON> Mofoye </PERSON> <PERSON> Oyetunde </PERSON>, chairman of the tribunal, said the convicted men had placed their own needs above the needs of society. `` With every right there must be a duty. Your duty was not to put the whole country in total blackout. Only God knows how many persons died as a result of the strike action and the great economic loss incurred by the government and the nation as a whole,'' said <PERSON> Oyetunde </PERSON>. The sentence is subject to review by the military government's <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and the men had 14 days to appeal In the past the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has charged rates well below cost, failed to collect many accounts and failed to guarantee a stable electricity supply.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> announced Saturday it has stopped jamming Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after two decades, and the U.S.-owned network urged <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to stop its interference with the station's signals. The Czechoslovak government said the jamming of the Munich-based radio station ended on Friday. `` We will be happy to be able to get our message through at last,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, the executive vice-president of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said the station will consider how to take better advantage of the cleared air waves between <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` We would be able to include more music, and we could also eliminate some repeat programs. All our jammed services had been repeated to make sure we got through,'' <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is the only Soviet bloc country that continues to hinder Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> signals. `` We'd like to see the last of the jamming countries stop the jamming.'' <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> had unexpectedly turned off some jammers aimed at Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday night, but switched them back on after several hours. Sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, who insisted on anonymity, said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also had stopped jamming <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welle </ORGANIZATION>, a West German radio station based in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrik </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welle </ORGANIZATION>, said interference of Czech-language broadcasts had stopped `` several months ago.'' <PERSON> Petrik </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Welle </PERSON>'s sister station, <PERSON> Deutschlandfunk </PERSON>, was responsible for the Czech-language programs. `` But they sometimes use our shortwave transmitters to send them.'' He said <PERSON> Czechosovakia </PERSON>'s jamming of both West German stations had stopped.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> informed the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that if it engages in terrorism the newly opened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks would be discontinued, a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday. `` There is no way this dialogue can be sustained if terrorism is persistent and traceable to known elements of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, made the point strenuously to a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation in their talk Friday in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, an ancient city on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, at a brief news conference at <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, said Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would `` do all our best to stop'' terrorism but said he could not guarantee that `` one person here or individual there'' might not ignore his wishes. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s main priority in the talks is to push for an early convening of an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said any resolution of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis would have to come from direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors, while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused to include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in any talks. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> described Friday's meeting as a `` step in the right direction'' toward a `` just and comprehensive settlement.'' At the same news conference, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> charged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO contacts by using deadly force against Palestinians. One potential sticking point in the talks was apparent: <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said a settlement must include establishment of an independent Palestinian state while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said its decision to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to such a state. Friday's session was the first authorized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in at least 13 years. No further meetings have been scheduled as yet, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who said major developments in the final five weeks of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration are unlikely. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said he did not expect a second meeting until after President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office next month. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said terrorism was the `` lead item'' on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agenda and took up half of the 75-minute meeting with a four-man <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation. While the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not make a specific promise in response, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, `` there was the general comment from their side that this dialogue is too important to have it messed up.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation implied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would make a special effort to restrict the activities of more radical elements, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s senior <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> specialist. Some Palestinian leaders have denounced <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Official newspapers in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also opposed the U.S.-PLO meeting, saying `` real peace should be taken by force,'' while President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said at a prayer meeting Friday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that `` the way to fight Zionism is by force and power.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was shocked by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision and announced he was preparing a new peace initiative. `` Of course it's painful to receive such a blow, especially from friends,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` But let's not exaggerate, we have had differences of opinion with our friends.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has offered to hold direct peace talks with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> while excluding the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> had promised <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1975 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would shun the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it did not accept the legitimacy of the Jewish state. The promise helped induce <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish land in the Sinai desert to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation made the point to <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> that `` not everybody is under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> control'' and can be deterred from terrorism. `` That obviously is not going to be a sustainable position should there be a rash of incidents which we would term terrorism,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Wednesday renounced terrorism `` in all forms.'' The statement was one of three conditions set by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for opening talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The two other conditions were explicit acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and approval of 1967 and 1973 resolutions of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> affirming all Middle Eastern countries should be able to live in peace within secure boundaries A little more than two weeks earlier, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had condemned the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization, called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> an `` accessory'' to terrorism and denied the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman permission to speak before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> shifted its debate on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s decision authorizing `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not changed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s view of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or his opposition to establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. In fact, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` nothing that happened Wednesday has changed our position or approach to the peace process.'' These include the view that an independent Palestinian state on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which are now held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, would not be viable, and that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should not have a separate seat in any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. `` We have n't pulled back from any of the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> initiative,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. He referred to the plan for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> took to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> earlier this year. It was not accepted by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, while Palestinian Arabs invited to meet with him in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> did not show up. Key features of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal included a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and having <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> give up some _ but not all _ of the land it won in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>'s meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials `` did n't answer any of the tough problems'' but with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue established it will be easier for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to understand each other's positions In the past, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had informed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stood. `` Cutting out the third party in a conversation should make it clearer,'' he said. The decision to open the dialogue, meanwhile, won praise from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly radio address, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions was `` long overdue'' and said progress would depend on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s success in controlling `` those factions within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> who believe that terrorism is a legitimate recourse.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to support the dialogue as `` an opportunity to be seized, an opportunity to develop a new national consensus regarding negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Cambodia Must Accept Peace Plan Before Talks Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the Cambodian rebel leader, said Saturday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> must accept a five-point peace plan before negotiations can continue. `` It's take it or leave it,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> told a meeting of his followers, who make up one of three rebel groups fighting the Cambodian government. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who has met <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> three times in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ the first in December 1987 and the latest last month _ called the prime minister `` a collaborator and a traitor,'' and the `` valet of the Vietnamese'' who `` sells off his country to the foriegners.'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s communist government was installed by the Vietnamese after they invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978, ending the four-year reign of terror by the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The five-point peace plan was outlined in July, when the leaders of the four Cambodian factions met in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The fourth group is the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> led by former Prime Minister Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. The points of the plan are: _ A precise timetable for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> claims <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but Western experts put the figure at more than 100,000. _ The dismantling of <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s regime _ General elections under the control of an international commission _ Formation of a new government and army that would include supporters of the four sides _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said Saturday he would run for president when the elections are held. The prince, speaking in French, said his meeting with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> last month was `` a total 500 percent failure.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> last week also met <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, in the village of <LOCATION> Fere-en-Tardenois </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. After the meeting, <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> told reporters his group considered <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> the `` national leader'' of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and he endorsed the five-point plan. `` They are not sincere, but they're intelligent,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said Saturday of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Although they were `` murderers,'' he added, they could not be ignored in planning <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians when they ruled the country in 1975-78. The 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the strongest of the three rebel groups, followed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s force, which the prince said Saturday has 20,000 soldiers and is growing. If the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is excluded from a new Cambodian government, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> added, they would become `` bandits, outlaws, terrorists, and every time we built a bridge they'd destroy it.'' He said any future agreement among the Cambodian factions must include guarantees that human rights will be respected. The Cambodian government insists it must have a guarantee that outside aid to the guerrilla forces, especially the Chinese-supplied <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, must cease before the Vietnamese withdrawal. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also has said the elections should be held under the present government, while <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> insists on the resignation of the governmnet before the vote. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also told reporters Friday that he opposes an international peacekeeping force.

 A newspaper editor who was deported from <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> for publishing articles about alleged government corruption arrived in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> on Saturday night and was allowed to stay in the country temporarily. The editor, South African-born <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON>, was detained for six weeks in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> before being deported by security police earlier today. Police allowed a few relatives and friends of the 29-year-old editor of The Mirror to see his plane off at the airport in <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a mountainous kingdom surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We have allowed him to stay in the country temporarily. Until he can find some place to go,'' an immigration officer in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the airport in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> that he wants to go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to join his father. He said he was born in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, and `` I have many relatives there.'' <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> claims he is a <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> citizen through his parents were working across the border when he was born. He fled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1980 after becoming involved in anti-apartheid organizations. Police in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> is a South African refugee. Under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner of Refugees, the <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> government does not send South African refugees back to their homeland or allow them to remain in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>.

All political activity is banned in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON>'s troubles began in November after he published articles stating that Minister of Finance <PERSON> Evaristus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekhonyana </PERSON>, who held the same portfolio in the <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> government, had authorized the transfer of millions of rands to the Swiss bank account of an Italian construction company, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION>, which had failed to finish a building project in 1981. The directors of the company had fled <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and the government liquidated the company. <PERSON> Maseko </PERSON> was detained under the Internal Security Act, which allows temporary detention of people considered a threat to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s national security When he appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for release on the ground that he posed no such threat, he was charged with criminally defaming the finance minister. When that charge was dropped, the head of the military council, Maj.

<TEXT>
 A thriller about the kidnapping of the president-elect which also features a vice-president from a <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> state has gone into a second printing since its release two months ago. The novel's author says it illustrates how the Constitution and federal laws are unclear and contradictory about what would happen if a president-elect were kidnapped between Election Day and when the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes. In real life, the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> meets Monday. In `` Oath of Office,'' a popular, crime-busting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> defeats a one-term president but is kidnapped while watching election returns. The country is plunged into a constitutional crisis. Author <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON>, a lawyer, said his first novel poses the question of what would happen if the president-elect were kidnapped. Would the vice president-elect be inaugurated instead? Though the book does n't mention President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the fictional vice president-elect in <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON>'s book _ which he sold in 1986 _ is a young senator from a Midwestern state selected to give the ticket geographical balance. `` The electors would be going through the same mental gymnastics if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were kidnapped,'' <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> said. `` What happens in real life would be what I described in my book.'' The 20th Amendment provides for the vice president-elect to become president if the president-elect dies before he can be sworn in. But what if the president-elect were kidnapped? Would the electors qualify the president-elect as president, even though he's missing Would the vice president-elect be named president? Or would the decision be thrown into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House? `` Everyone has agreed there is no precedent for this,'' <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> said. `` There is no clear-cut answer, and if it happens, the country would be in a worse crisis than Watergate.'' In <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON>'s 355-page book, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> defeats <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> to become the nation's first Jewish president-elect. But on election night <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is kidnapped from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hotel room by henchmen of <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, a corrupt labor leader. The country is plunged into a constitutional crisis. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, who is negotiating a secret <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan, considers whether he should have himself declared the winner. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkin </PERSON>, the power-hungry speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, plots to steal the election. And the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the press scramble to find <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>. `` The politics would be brutal,'' <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> said. `` Our allies would n't know what would happen. It would be so unsettling to the stock market. And people would be very worried.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>, an associate professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, agrees that the Constitution is ambiguous about what would happen if the president-elect were kidnapped. `` It's not anticipated in the Constitution and it's not clearly covered,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON> said he does n't believe a constitutional crisis would result. `` If it should happen, a way would be found to cover it,'' he said. `` Probably the courts would not have trouble advising what to do.'' <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON>, 37, said he began thinking about writing a book about a Jewish president while a college student in the mid-1970s. He said he found himself wondering how a Jewish president would deal with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He also was intrigued by what would happen if the president-elect were kidnapped. He thought about a 1933 assassination attempt on President-elect <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, in which <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON> was killed. `` I thought, ` That's it. I'll merge the two stories,''' <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> began writing the book in 1980. Five years later, he hooked up with an agent, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who also represents espionage-thriller writer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> and `` Rambo'' creator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>. After the book was rejected by 10 publishers, the paperback division of <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bought the manuscript in 1986. The publisher, <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> said, decided to hold off issuing the book until 1988 to capitalize on the presidential election. <ORGANIZATION> Fawcett-Crest </ORGANIZATION> published `` Oath of Office'' in October. More than 100,000 copies of the book have been printed, according to <ORGANIZATION> Fawcett-Crest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sold her grocery store in the 1960s and retired here, but she still has a file cabinet full of bills due her from the Depression years. Last week she got a $ 100 check in a Christmas card from a family that charged their groceries at her store in <LOCATION> Ratliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> around 1935. A note said, `` Daddy wanted me to send you this on the debt we owed you.'' `` I opened it, and I did n't know what to say,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` The file cabinets in the storage shed are full of statements that have been left unpaid for more than 50 years. We've still got people owes us over $ 1,000 bills.'' She still has the records, but she no longer expects payments. `` I did n't expect this one, either,'' she said. The bills are past due because the <ORGANIZATION> Sullivans </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> and her late husband, <PERSON> J.E. </PERSON>, opened the store in <LOCATION> Ratliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which she still calls <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Corner </PERSON>, in 1927. Unfortunately, the store and the Depression started at the same time. `` We sold groceries on the credit and charged them. We sure let a lot of groceries out we never got money for.''

<TEXT>
 The government on Saturday ruled out calling early elections in response to a one-day general strike against economic policies that shut down nearly all business and labor activity. Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> told reporters no resignations of any ministers were planned due to Wednesday's strike by the two major leftist unions. She reiterated the Socialist administration's willingness to open wide-ranging talks with the two major leftist unions that organized it and top business leaders But the Socialist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the Communist-dominated Workers Commissions again rejected Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s offer to take part in talks with the government and the head of the nation's key business organization. The Socialists hold a comfortable majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and do not have to call elections until June 1990. The general strike was the first in 54 years. The unions want unemployment insurance coverage broadened to include up to 48 percent of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 2.7 million jobless and the smallest retirement pensions increased to the legal monthly minimum wage of $ 394. Ms. <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> said a government representative, perhaps <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, would explain the administration's view of the strike and the demands of the unions before parliament Wednesday. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> issued a statement a day after the strike acknowledging it as a `` political success'' and a `` tough political blow to the government.'' He repeated his offer to discuss demands with unions and the head of the top business organization. On Friday, leaders of the socialist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the communist-dominated Workers Commissions appeared at a large, peaceful demonstration in central <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and rejected the meeting offered by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> if he insists the head of the nation's key business organization attend. At least 40,000 people attended the rally. Despite an economic growth rate of 5 percent annually that puts it at the top of Western European economies, 18.7 percent of the people are unemployed, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest rate.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is further scaling back operations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and will reduce its forces from 15 to 14 ships early next month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said Saturday. In the latest change of procedure, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships will use radar to monitor U.S.-flagged vessels in the waterway, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The move means the warships may no longer be within quick reach in emergencies. One source said the change, like some earlier ones, reflects a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> judgment that the threat to shipping in the gulf has decreased since the cease-fire in the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> went into effect Aug. 20. At least 1 million people have been killed or wounded in the war, which followed border skirmishes and an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> invasion in September 1980. The fighting spilled over into the gulf with attacks on foreign ships. There have been no armed incidents reported in the gulf since the truce, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has already reduced its forces in the region by two ships. Other foreign navies are also reducing operations or pulling out. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said during a visit to the region Dec. 5 that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had made no plans for major changes in forces because U.N.-sponsored peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are stalled. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have talked recently of an eventual force of about 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in the gulf. The cut in force strength results from cancellation of orders last week for a missile frigate, USS Klakring, to leave for the gulf from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Three others, the destroyer USS <PERSON> O'Bannon </PERSON> and the missile frigates USS Hawes and USS De <PERSON> Wert </PERSON> sailed for the Gulf as planned, however, and on arrival in January will replace ships completing three-month duty tours in the waterway. The four leaving are the missile cruiser USS <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and the missile frigates USS <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, USS Doyle and USS Taylor.

 A Soviet delegation on Saturday opened a new round of talks on prisoner exchanges with Afghan guerrillas, who said the Soviets refused to move the discussions beyond that issue. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported, in an apparent reference to guerrillas, that `` criminal extremists'' blasted <PERSON> Mehthar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON>, the capital of the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Laghman </LOCATION>, with 1,500 rockets over the last three days. The radio said 15 people were killed and 24 injured. The radio report, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said Afghan government troops repulsed the guerrillas who were trying to overtake the city about 60 miles northeast of the Afghan capital <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The talks in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s capital, centered on return of four Soviet soldiers held by guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> province, said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, one of two guerrilla delegates to the talks. He said the Soviets, who back the Marxist Afghan government with thousands of troops, refused to move the talks beyond prisoner exchange. He said attempts to steer talks toward what guerrillas call a Soviet escalation of combat failed. `` We showed our concern that we thought they were not serious'' about peace, he said. The guerrillas say about 5,000 Soviet soldiers have returned to the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in recent days. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> has been under guerrilla seige for several months There has been no independent confirmation of a renewed Soviet presence there. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which sent its forces to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, began withdrawing its troops in May under an agreement brokered by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Half of more than 100,000 Soviet troops left the country by Aug. 15 and remainder are to leave by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the four-member <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation wanted proof of the identity of the four <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> prisoners. The rebel representative said it is impossible to show the Soviets the four prisoners because of the `` war situation.'' He accused the Soviets of stalling the exchange. He said the guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or islamic warriors, are ready to hand the four prisoners over for 100 guerrillas. `` They are delaying _ not us,'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. The one-hour meeting in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Saturday ended without any agreement, he said. The Soviet Embassy declined to make any immediate comment. An earlier round of Soviet-rebel talks in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in November ended without reports of significant progress.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> has cut off funds to a gang-control organization once considered a model program for reducing street tension, forcing a halt to its programs. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems, including a $ 203,000 debt to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, were insurmountable `` We will not use city funds to pay off an old debt,'' he said. The mayor said he hoped the private, non-profit agency's program and employees could be absorbed by another agency so that its work could continue, but he said no alternatives have been explored. The group's executive director, <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swans </PERSON>, said 38 of the 48 employees were laid off Friday and its programs were shut down. He said he and the other nine employees would stay until Jan. 5, when city funding ends, to tie up loose ends and try to find another source of funds. `` Everyone agrees we've performed a valuable service,'' Swans said. `` I think that the services are sorely needed in the community and I think people are going to suffer because of it.'' The decision to close the agency came after months of uncertainty over its future, sparked by complaints of financial mismanagement. The Crisis Intervention Network was founded in 1975 as an arm of city government. Its approach to gang warfare _ using street-savvy workers, many of them former gang members, to mediate disputes and reduce community tension _ won praise and became a model for programs around the country. The network became a private, non-profit agency in 1979, but the city has remained its principal source of funds, with city contracts paying $ 1.5 million or more in each of the past three years. But three months ago, a group of current and former employees wrote to elected officials and news media accusing Swans of spending abuses and mismanagement. Swans called the allegations groundless, but acknowledged bookkeeping problems, including a failure to send to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> about $ 80,000 withheld from employee paychecks. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> filed a $ 203,000 lien against the network Dec. 9, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON>, co-chairman of the agency's board. He said the board had not decided `` whether it's over, whether to reorganize, bankruptcy. ... We have choices.'' `` I think the city has gotten used to CIN stepping in when things get hot,'' <PERSON> Kairys </PERSON> said. `` We are the envy of cities around the country. It just seems unnecessary and detrimental for the city to cut off the funding.''

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defense minister on Saturday tried to defuse tensions behind a recent insurrection, defending the military view of a repressive campaign against leftists that convulsed the nation a decade ago. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> said civilians who applauded a March 1976 military coup must share some responsibility for the campaign by security forces, known as the Dirty War, that killed 9,000 Argentines. He called the action necessary. The repression remains a burning political issue and the question of whether it was necessary in order to end chaos divides <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which resumed civilian rule in 1985 after the military returned to the barracks. <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON>'s remarks, in a speech to newly commissioned officers, is an apparent attempt to placate military resentment that burst forth in a four-day insurrection earlier this month and lingers despite the acceptance by the government of a key rebel demand _ a pay increase. `` The great part of the -LRB- 1970s -RRB- struggle was outside the framework of constitutional governments, leaving open to question the political and legal legitimacy of a battle that was necessary,'' <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> told the officers at the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The military view is that it fought an unconventional war against leftist guerrillas using unconventional means and deserves a better role in society. The view by human rights groups is that what happened amounted to organized murder. `` The phenomenon -LRB- terrorism -RRB- was eliminated, but not the rebuke'' by society, he said. `` We should admit that we made a mistake. Are we going to keep trying to put all the blame on one side ... or are we going to accept the reality that is evident to every sensible Argentine?'' He said civilians in 1976 wanted an end to the bombings, assassinations and kidnappings that had become almost daily occurrences, and must share the responsibility. `` The coups through which we Argentines have lived were not the exclusive action of the military,'' <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> said. While the army fought guerrilla battles with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, security forces as a whole have been condemned for arresting several thousand Argentine citizens _ alleged sympathesizers _ who `` disappeared'' and were presumed executed The presence of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> indicated that <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> spoke for the government. `` It is necessary to bring to an end a period of mutual scorn and reciprocal ignorance,'' <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> said. `` Our society has gone through a crisis which should be confronted with the essential key of unity.'' A day before, army chief Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> said in a TV interview that he agreed with demands made by rebel commander Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, including the need to reintegrate the armed forces into society as valued members. `` I say emphatically: there was a war against subversion and it is absolutely unjust to accuse the armed forces of genocide,'' <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> said. The rebels demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, a shakeup of the command structure, and a bigger military budget. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and leaders of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have said publicly that they oppose any amnesty for officers already convicted of human rights abuses, or under prosecution on murder and torture charges. In December 1985, a civilian court convicted five former military junta members, including ex-military Presidents <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, for human rights abuses.

 Palestinians shut down the occupied territories Saturday to mourn the fatal shooting of five Arabs a day earlier, and 18 Palestinians were wounded in new clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, hospital source said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 9-month-old girl from the Dolev Jewish settlement suffered a serious head injury in a stone-throwing attack. Dozens of angry Jewish settlers blocked a highway in retaliation, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said without providing details. The impromptu strike paralyzed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> as well as Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Palestinians hurled stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, and students abandoned classes to march with outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, an Arab reporter said. Black mourning flags were raised on school rooftops. `` Strike against the occupation army,'' said a slogan painted by Moslem fundamentalists in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Groups of masked youths walked the streets, ordering merchants to close their shops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Palestinians clashed with troops in some of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s refugee camps. Twelve people were wounded in stone-throwing protests in the Jabaliya, Nusseirat, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, Shati and Bureij camps, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army clamped a curfew on Shati, home to 42,000 Arabs. The army confirmed six wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and two in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and said it was checking the other reports. Among the wounded was a 41-year-old woman struck by a bullet in the back of the head, said officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. They said they also treated two sisters, aged 3 and 7, who were hit by rubber bullets. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, students took to the streets to hurl stones at policemen. Ten young <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters were detained during a riot near national police headquarters, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, nine miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, streets were empty except for groups of masked youths hurling rocks at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Officials at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> hospital said they treated two wounded men from the nearby Kafr ed-Dik village. Palestinians also held mourning processions in many <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> areas, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Hundreds of residents marched through the narrow streets of <LOCATION> Zawata </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, carrying black flags, wreaths and outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, and a mourning procession of women was reported in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. A 25-year-old curfew violator who decided to sneak out and visit his neighbor was shot in the leg, hospital officials said. The strike was to protest the deaths Friday of five Palestinians in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. Four of the victims died Friday, and the fifth, 20-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Kuni </PERSON>, died overnight of a chest wound at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' Ittihad Hospital, officials said. Thirty-two Palestinians were wounded Friday in other parts of the occupied territories. Hundreds of black flags flew from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> rooftops Saturday. The city and surrounding refugee camps, where 120,000 Palestinians live, have been under military curfew since Friday. Despite the curfew, dozens of youths, their heads wrapped in traditional checkered Arab headdresses, were in the streets, pelting troops with rocks and eggs. Soldiers responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Three young Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hawara </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Abush </PERSON> villages, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. At least 329 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed since the uprising began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has controlled since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The violence cast doubt on the scheduled reopening of secondary schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military administration said about 230 secondary schools with over 30,000 students would reopen Sunday after being closed since September.

 Deposed <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was scheduled to go home Sunday after more than a week in the hospital, an attorney said. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said final tests were being conducted Saturday, and three doctors have been retained to review the results of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' stay at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The doctors are expected to provide evidence to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too ill to travel there for arraignment on fraud and racketeering charges, <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, was hospitalized Dec. 10 after reportedly suffering chest pains. His doctors confirmed he suffers from weakened heart muscles. A hospital spokeswoman said Saturday that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` is doing fine.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> faces federal racketeering charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accusing him of plundering his nation's economy during his 20-year rule and stashing some of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was to be arraigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but he and his lawyers contend he is too frail to make the 10-hour flight. A court-appointed doctor who examined him before his most recent hospitalization concluded that he did have medical problems, but not severe enough to prevent him from traveling. The doctor also said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> faked symptoms of pain during the examination. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, has pleaded innocent to the same charges and is free on bail. The couple have lived in exile here since they were ousted from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1986.

 A second defendant charged in the takeover of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> newspaper has fled to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> reservation, saying he is in fear for his life, his attorney said Saturday. `` I view him as I would anyone fleeing a Third World dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s attorneys, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` He has no intention of returning to <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> unless or until democracy is restored there.'' He said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> had telephoned him to say he was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but would not specify where. However, in a phone call Saturday to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said he was with co-defendant <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> on the Onondaga Indian Reservation near <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I have left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I have taken sanctuary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and I intend to stay here. I can not be forced back. There is no jurisdiction where I am. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no jurisdiction, and the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does not.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 20, were indicted Dec. 6 by a <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, grand jury on state kidnapping charges, less than two months after they were acquitted of federal hostage-taking charges in the Feb. 1 takeover of The Robesonian newspaper in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>. A trial date has not been set. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> contend taking over the newspaper was the only way they could draw attention to what they call public corruption in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was free on $ 25,000 bond posted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, with the stipulation that he stay in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and appear for his court dates. `` This would appear to violate that,'' <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said. `` It's unfortunate, but I understand why he did it. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said he had written a letter to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` I'm sure they will understandand it will be worked out in the end,'' he said. `` They realize the situation we're in and they're sympathetic to our cause. No one answered the telephone Saturday afternoon at the church group's headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Onondaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that it had no jurisdiction over the reservation and could not go onto the property to look for <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials said Saturday they had no information on <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s whereabouts. `` We did not have him under surveillance,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynor </PERSON>, chief of detectives for the sheriff's department. `` If he has fled to avoid prosecution, then necessary steps will be taken if he fails to appear in court.'' Onondaga Indian Chief <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shenandoah </PERSON>, reached at his home Saturday, said he did not know where <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was and refused further comment. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> fled to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reservation when the state charges were filed and was arrested Tuesday after a car chase with state police near <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION>, N.Y. He is scheduled to appear in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, court Jan. 12 on charges stemming from the chase. He was released Friday under $ 25,000 bond, also posted by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, after Onondaga Indian leaders gave a sworn statement that they would not harbor him if <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> orders his extradition to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has said he'll push for <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' extradition. <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said he has received recent death threats. `` I will not return to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> until we have a just system of government in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and that means the resignation of Governor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and his blood-thirsty vultures,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said.

 Ten days after <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s devastating earthquake, rescue workers freed a 62-year-old woman from a collapsed building Saturday, but officials indicated they will soon halt efforts to rescue others. In another dramatic rescue tale, a health official said Saturday that a woman trapped in her basement helped keep her 3-year-old alive by pricking her own fingers and letting the child suck her blood. The health of the 30-year-old mother, who was rescued Thursday after eight days, was improving and her child was in good condition, said Dr. <PERSON> Ophelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazaryan </PERSON>, head physician at Childrens Hospital No. 3 in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. A national Politburo commission overseeing relief operations in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> said the `` first and most acute stage of rescue operations is drawing to an end,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital. The high-level commission said preparations were beginning to rebuild housing, factories and farms in the zone struck by the Dec. 7 quake. Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who heads the commission, said `` the focus of the relief effort will soon shift to restoration work,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. However, in a possible split between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and Armenian officials on relief priorities, <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutunyan </PERSON> said `` rescuing people is remaining the main task in the stricken areas,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, leaders of government ministries met Saturday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to determine how to rebuild the ravaged area, where the homes of an estimated 500,000 people were ruined. The official casualty toll in the earthquake that rocked northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is an estimated 55,000 dead with thousands injured. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday night that a total of 23,390 bodies have been recovered. That would mean about an equal number of victims may still lie buried in the ruins. In the past 24 hours, the woman in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> was the only survivor found by rescue parties combing through debris, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said late Saturday. Altogether, 89 bodies were also removed from collapsed apartment houses and other buildings, it said. Worsening weather will bring wet snow and wind to the quake zone, where tens of thousands are living in tents or in the open air, the Politburo commission said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said said 9,862 people were evacuated from the disaster area Friday and Saturday and more than 24,000 people who lost their homes were living in the region in other shelter. An Armenian official told Soviet television Friday night that 20 people had been found alive in the ruins of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> on Thursday and one in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, an Armenian city virtually destroyed in the quake. However, a government official overseeing search and rescue efforts in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, once home to more than 250,000 people, said it was now just as urgent to uncover and bury the dead as it was to find more survivors. Otherwise, disease could spread, said Armenian Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Vardkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> urged a temporary halt to planning new flights of worldwide relief shipments to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic to assess where relief was most needed and avoid waste. <PERSON> Edgard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eeckman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, said `` It's not that that there are no more needs in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The message is, let's stop for a little while to make an evaluation.'' The trapped woman in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, identified by witnesses only as <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, was eased from the rubble after a 20-member rescue team from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> heard her voice from underneath, witnesses said. It took 2 -LCB- hours to free the gray-haired woman from the wreckage of what had been the kitchen of a third-floor apartment. The bodies of four children, apparently the woman's grandchildren, were also found in the debris The woman, who looked alert and gripped the stretcher she was placed on, was rushed to a hospital. Chief Dr. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Uruman </PERSON> marveled that she was still alive after being buried for 10 days, but said she had suffered extensive injuries to a thigh and was in critical condition. `` It was a miracle, but I doubt she will live,'' said <PERSON> Uruman </PERSON>. Near the ruined nine-story building, sobbing by a smouldering campfire, sat the woman's daughter, who appeared to be in her 40s. She repeated the names of relatives killed in the same apartment where her mother was found. In another section of the wrecked building, rescue workers uncovered the bodies of a man, woman and child who had died while huddled together. The Armenian official whose report was broadcast on Soviet television Friday said the discovery of a survivor in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> spurred officials there to continue looking for survivors for 10 more days. An estimated 15,000 of 25,000 people in that city were killed. <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON> said rescue efforts would continue for a few more days in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, but no firm deadline to stop had been set. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> has said some of the rescue work is going slowly because relatives are lying in front of bulldozers to prevent them from moving in until their relatives' bodies were recovered. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON> said demolition of buildings left partially standing could begin in two days.

 A patient was knocked to the ground Saturday during an anti-abortion protest at a clinic in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, one of six states where demonstrations were held. More than 300 people were arrested. Police arrested 79 protesters in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; 58 in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; 101 in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; 40 in <LOCATION> Chamblee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; 13 in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; and 20 in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, about 175 demonstrators gathered outside the <LOCATION> Hillcrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Women </LOCATION>'s Clinic, authorities said. The majority of the protesters were men, said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, director of educational programs for the clinic. One man knocked a patient and an escort to the ground, but no one was hurt, she said. The demonstration did not disrupt operations at the clinic, she said, adding, `` None of our patients called in to cancel.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahlenborn </PERSON>, one of the demonstrators, said the group was `` under the principles of Operation Rescue,'' referring to a <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based group that orchestrated protests this year at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and in dozens of other cities around the nation, resulting in more than 9,000 arrests. <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> Police Cpl. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauasuli </PERSON> said all the people arrested were released a short time later. They will be subject to a fine of up to $ 300. In <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, about 500 people gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, and arrests numbered at least 58, authorities said. Protesters took as long as an hour to crawl on their knees from clinic entrances to police buses. `` I was hoping it would slow them down and keep the clinic closed this morning,'' said one demonstrator, <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Palfrey </PERSON>. `` I'm here to protest the killing of unborn babies and lend support to the women who realize the pain and guilt after abortion.'' Patients began arriving at the clinic about 6 a.m., about an hour before the protesters, and the clinic closed about 9:30 a.m. when all the patients had been seen. `` We did procedures this morning and the patients are ready to leave,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. `` Their goal was not achieved. Abortions have been performed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogillio </PERSON> said those arrested would be charged under a city ordinance for failure to leave a premises _ a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of a $ 500 fine and 30 days in jail. Saturday's demonstration followed similar protests on Friday at another <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> clinic, where 108 of about 250 protesters were arrested. In <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 101 people were arrested Saturday outside a Planned Parenthood clinic at an Operation Rescue-organized demonstration. Police Lt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said protesters did not resist arrest. About 35 to 50 counterprotesters also were at the clinic, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said.

 The world's most secretive giant threw open its borders last week to bare the pain of the Armenian earthquake and let the world _ and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people _ help dig out victims from under the rubble. Suddenly, Soviets were human. They were crying in grief, agonizing over the crumbled concrete hiding their lost loved ones, bleeding from their wounds. They had faces, unlike the thousands of unidentified Soviets irradiated and uprooted under cover of a media blackout following the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power station explosion just two and a half years ago. In opening the region to international relief workers, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also gained $ 100 million in emergency aid, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. It also saved thousands of lives that would have been lost without French search dogs, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> doctors and Belgian artificial kidney machines. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone sent $ 6.6 million in assistance from both government and private sources. It was the first time since World War II that international aid has poured into the fiercely self-sufficient <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and once again it cracked the image of evil Western capitalists fostered by decades of propaganda. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, thanking the world for help last week, fondly recalled eating Spam, an American canned meat product, during World War II. He said he still considers it a delicacy. Foreign journalists, who normally must wait weeks or months for permission to enter the country, flew in aboard relief planes and were handed monthlong visas at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> airport. Others went straight to the stricken area without papers and were n't disturbed by authorities, who ordinarily subject each new arrival to a thorough document check. The government waived its requirement that Moscow-based correspondents give 48 hours' notice and a detailed itinerary before they leave the city, and it reopened <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which had been closed to foreign journalists since a renewed outbreak of ethnic violence in November. Correspondents hitchhiked, explored and conducted interviews wherever they chose. A foreign reporter caught rides with Soviet troops. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which now holds daily press briefings but rarely provides news, gave regular updates on the number of casualties and the state of the relief effort. In the same nation that covered up the deaths of more than 100,000 people in the <LOCATION> Ashkhabad </LOCATION> quake 40 years ago, the Soviet press pounced on the story this time. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency poured out reams of copy and offered foreign agencies wrenching photographs of the tragedy starting the day after the quake. Newspapers printed daily interviews with victims, rescuers and even critics of the disorganization hampering the relief effort. They printed articles with talk of shoddy construction practices that caused concrete-slab buildings to collapse and contributed to the huge death toll. Only hours before the quake destroyed most of three cities and more than 100 rural villages, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that advances in mass media and transportation were making the world `` more visible and tangible.'' `` Today, the preservation of any kind of closed society is hardly possible,'' said the leader of a nation that has tried for much of its history to insulate itself from the outside. He did not know then that in a few hours he would have the opportunity to demonstrate that belief.

 An elderly man despondent over his retarded 36-year-old daughter's illness shot her to death and turned the gun on himself, neighbors and family members said. Police were still investigating the double shooting, but Police Chief <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> said it's `` a pretty clear case of a homicide-suicide.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON>, a 73-year-old retired truck driver, and his daughter, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>, were found Thursday in the woman's bedroom. Each had bullet wound in the head. Miss <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> lay in bed in her pajamas, a stuffed dog tucked in her arms. `` It's sad that it happened, but I can understand why he did what he did,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, 39. `` He hated to see her suffer. He loved her.'' Miss <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> was discharged Wednesday from <LOCATION> Christ </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, where she was admitted Oct. 31 for treatment of a large tumor, apparently non-cancerous, on her neck. Her father spent most of his time with her at the hospital, as she went through surgery and tests. <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> took his daughter home the day before their bodies were found, according to his grandson, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 27. She was depressed and not eating, he said. `` We had no hint something like this would happen,'' the grandson said. `` Maybe <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> thought she was going to suffer.'' <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> left a suicide note saying `` he was sorry, that <PERSON> God </PERSON> told him this is what he had to do,'' said <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumbelic </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office said tests on the woman's body showed no signs of cancer, but that she did have `` endocrine abnormalities.'' She said further tests were being conducted. <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON>'s wife died more than 19 years ago and he cared for his daughter with devotion and without complaint, neighbors said. <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> DeYoung </PERSON> would help with the cooking and cleaning. `` Ed was always friendly, always joking, and that was unusual considering what he might have been going through taking care of his daughter,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>. `` He was very devoted to her and I know he did it out of love,'' she said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Saturday he was shocked by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and announced he was preparing a new peace initiative to counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move. In downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, thousands of right-wing Israelis and Jewish settlers demonstrated to protest the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. Some protesters later marched to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. `` We must break terrorism in the field and the state terrorism of both the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' one speaker told protesters. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s comments on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio were the first by the right-wing leader since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> announced Wednesday it had ended a ban on talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not surprising that we were shocked by the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- decision to talk with the organization which is our most radical enemy,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move posed `` a very serious test'' to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s alliance with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the strongest supporter of the Jewish state and the donor of $ 3 billion a year in foreign aid. In making the decision, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave in to external and internal pressures, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. He predicted U.S.-PLO dialogue will fail when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is put to the test of halting terrorism. He reiterated his staunch opposition to any dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also confirmed earlier reports of his plan to announce a new <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> initiative after the formation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new government. He declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s close ally in the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, said on the radio that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s next government will discuss a unilateral move to grant Palestinians limited self-rule, as envisioned in the 1978 U.S.-mediated Camp David accord between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says it will settle only for an independent Palestinian state. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> views the accord as outdated. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said two Labor Cabinet Ministers, <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaakobi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON>, plan to raise the autonomy issue at the Cabinet meeting Sunday. The self-rule idea could bridge the gap between <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. The two main parties have been locked in complex coalition talks since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 parliament elections. They disagree sharply on the issue of peace moves. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes conceding land captured in 1967, while <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> favors a territorial compromise in exchange for peace. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and other Labor leaders, responding to the recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, have proposed elections in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and talks with elected Palestinian representatives as a substitute for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> may include the idea in his autonomy program. Palestinian notables in the occupied territories, however, reject moves that would exclude the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, said Friday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was `` a grave mistake, both regarding terrorism and the possibility of open political talks.'' The decision, he said, `` actually granted legitimacy to the uprising in the territories,'' or the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> revolt in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Since the uprising broke out Dec. 8, 329 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed. Demonstrators in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate lit candles and waved signs that read: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave a medal to the killers of our children,'' and `` <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, stay out!'' The organizers said they later glued to the consulate door a letter addressed to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accusing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` falling to its knees'' before the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

 A gang member aiming at a member of a rival gang opened fire inside a crowded mall, fatally wounding a 16-year-old bystander, police said Saturday. In other gang-related shootings, a reputed 27-year-old gang member was killed while walking with his girlfriend and two 17-year-olds were wounded near the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Memorial Coliseum. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpuche </PERSON>, 16, was shopping at a mall in <LOCATION> Panorama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 15 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, on Friday when he was hit by a bullet intended for a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> gang member, police Detective <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alpuche </PERSON> died at Holy Cross Medical Center on Saturday. The intended victim was fighting with a rival gang member among the crowd of holiday shoppers when one of the rival's friends fired a handgun, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. The gunman was in his early 20s, he added. No arrests had been made by Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, a reputed gang member strolling with his girlfriend was gunned down by rivals at 11:20 p.m. Friday, said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hom </PERSON> The girlfriend was unharmed. Two carloads of gang members confronted <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as he walked late Friday night in a southwest <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighborhood and one man shot <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> three times, sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hom </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was pronounced dead 30 minutes later. The two youths wounded in the shooting near the Coliseum were hit by the same bullet as they rode in the back seat of a car, police said. They were both hospitalized in stable condition.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter on Saturday rescued two pilots who were stranded four days on a remote Canadian glacier after making an emergency landing in their vintage World War II-era airplane. One of the pilots said they were tired but in good condition after living on snacks, water and beer in the snowbound plane. The vintage Grumman Widgeon amphibious plane was equipped with survival gear. `` We both lost a little weight, but that's about it,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. Whiteout conditions had prevented rescuers from getting to the pilots during daily attempts that began Tuesday. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 38, said in a telephone interview from his home that he landed the plane after the engines failed. He and fellow pilot <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, 31, were confident they would be rescued, he said. `` We pretty much knew we were OK. We probably could have stayed there another week without being in too bad a shape,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said The two men had reported by radio earlier that they were unhurt and comfortable, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The H-3 helicopter hoisted the men from the glacier about 10:20 a.m. AST and they were flown to their hometown of <PERSON> Gustavus </PERSON>, about 60 miles south, Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Atta </PERSON> said. The rescue was performed swiftly because of the danger, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. The helicopter hovered about 70 feet above the ice as the men climbed, one at a time, into a basket. `` It was quite a demanding, difficult manuever since snow blows up when you're hovering over something like that,'' <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> said. `` It creates whiteout conditions. It was very difficult for the pilot.'' <PERSON> Ehret </PERSON> credited <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> for waiting out the storm and advising rescuers to do the same. `` They could tell early on that the weather was n't getting any better,'' he said. `` They had cool heads.'' `` It just worked really well,'' said <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. `` There were n't a lot of questions and answers. You just do what you know you've got to do.'' The face of the glacier, at <LOCATION> Tarr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, is in <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and Preserve and is about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Gustavus </LOCATION>, a small southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> port town. The huge river of ice stretches far into <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Nightly temperatures on the glacier were estimated at 20 to 25 degrees, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The pilots were several miles inside <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had received permission from the Canadian government to conduct the rescue. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> lived on cheese, salami, a bag of corn chips and two cans of oysters. They rationed the food and had still some left when they were rescued. `` We just nibbled. We drank plenty of water. We had a case of beer and we drank that,'' he said. `` We really were n't that hungry because we were so inactive.'' `` We did well together. We had three magazines that we both read about three different times, backwards and forwards,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said the plane, which is being restored, was undamaged and would be flown off the glacier later this week if the weather permits. `` We're going to have to go up and get it,'' he said. `` It'll fly right out of there. It's a great airplane.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> operate <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adventures </ORGANIZATION>, a Gustavus-based company that transports anglers, hunters, photographers and tourists to remote spots in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Snowfall and poor visibility prevented the helicopter from reaching the plane until the first break in the weather came Saturday morning. Officials had kept in radio contact with the men by repeatedly flying a C-130 transport plane over the glacier. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been great,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said.

 A moderate Lebanese militia on Saturday surrounded pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists and forced them to free three Irish <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops kidnapped a day earlier in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> indicated he was involved in the release a day earlier of a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official. A leading Shiite cleric said he has given up trying to free 14 other foreign hostages because his efforts have reached a `` dead end.'' Lebanese police said the mainstream Shiite Moslem militia Amal surrounded a house in the village of <LOCATION> Sultaniyeh </LOCATION> and forced about 20 men inside, belonging to the group <ORGANIZATION> Faithful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, to surrender and free the three Irish soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>. A police spokesman said the militia also conducted a sweep rounding up 80 other members of Faithful Resistance, a small fanatic affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police sources said the Faithful Resistance kidnapped the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> soldiers Friday in retaliation for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> detainment of a group leader and other guerrillas. `` Amal summoned the Faithful Resistance's seven commanders individually to a meeting to discuss the release of the Irish soldiers and captured them when they refused to release peacekeepers unconditionally. Their followers gave in a while later,'' said the police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations. The house in <LOCATION> Sultaniyeh </LOCATION> was one mile southwest of <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, where the Irishmen were abducted. The 620-strong Irish batallion serving with <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, a village 13 miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> which borders <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s six-to-10-mile self-proclaimed security zone. The police spokesman identified the three rescued Irish soldiers as <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeken </PERSON>, 35, Pvt <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, 25, and Pvt. <PERSON> Bernak </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarugmey </PERSON>, 30. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> returned the three to their command. `` They are in good shape,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The abductions apparently were intended to retaliate for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s seizure Thursday of Faithful Resistance guerrilla commander <PERSON> Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasfi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> The Israeli military command said <PERSON> Kasfi </PERSON> was linked to attacks on Israeli army forces and an Israeli-backed militia, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, since 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 32, was freed Friday night in the southern city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, where he was abducted Nov. 17. Police said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> boarded a ferry Saturday at the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, heading for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The Swiss Foreign Ministry earlier said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was to fly home via <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> Sunday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> indicated Saturday he played a role in the release when he was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` When I was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> asked me to help release the Swiss employee, and he has been released,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said without elaborating. He spoke shortly after his arrival in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered. In <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, Swiss Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said Saturday that talks between a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> official and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> proved `` useful.'' <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s captors tried to tie his release to a lenient sentence for a jailed Lebanese plane hijacker, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> refused any concessions. He said that in indirect contacts, the kidnappers identified themselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group named `` <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>.'' An official of the <ORGANIZATION> all-Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said the humanitarian agency will negotiate safety guarantees with `` various parties and groups'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before resuming full activities there. The delegation, cut nearly in half after <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was kidnapped, will be brought back to its original size of 30 as soon as possible, said the official at <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s release leaves 14 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing and presumed kidnapped by pro-Iranian factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 Soviet-born cellist <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> played in a charity concert for Armenian earthquake victims Saturday night after postponing a visit to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to take part in the event. `` It was very important for me to take part in this concert,'' the 61-year-old musician said before a last-minute rehearsal with flutist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON>, conductor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> and other musicians who rearranged their schedules and donated time to perform. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the British throne, and his wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, attended the sell-out concert at the 2,026-seat Barbican Hall in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The event was part of an effort called `` Musicians for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' which was expected to raise $ 452,000 from donations worldwide, including gifts from musicians, concert proceeds and film and recording rights. The British <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> organized the appeal to aid some of the thousands of survivors from the killer earthquake Dec. 7 that killed an estimated 55,000 people. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and five other nations televised the late-night performance. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s world service rearranged its radio programming to allow its estimated audience of 25 million to hear the concert live. `` At the moment, with what has happened, I feel that all Armenians are my relatives,'' said <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen of Armenian descent who is conductor of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, one of the most famous cellists in history, gave his first solo concert in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in nearly two decades, also in aid of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, who conducted the English Chamber Orchestra during the concert Saturday, said before the program that it was `` amazing'' the musicians were able to join. `` In our business everyone's booked up for the next two or three years,'' he said. `` It was just good fortune that everyone could make it at such short notice.'' `` This terrible catastrophe has provoked the best qualities in people,'' said <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>. The cellist played <PERSON> Villa-Lobos </PERSON>' Bachianas Brasileiras No. 1, then turned to the piano to accompany his Soviet-born wife, soprano <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishnevskaya </PERSON>, in works by <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>. The program also included <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> playing <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON>'s Syrinx and <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> conducting the English Chamber Orchestra in <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Coriolan Overture Soviet pianist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavrilov </PERSON>, whose family in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> escaped injury in the quake, played <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>.

 A crew planning to take durable, plastic tents to earthquake victims in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> got word Saturday that a Soviet military cargo plane will carry them to the disaster site, the group's leader said. The 17-member team is scheduled to leave Sunday, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON>, president of Protect-A-Boat and Film Applicators of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, company that came up with the idea for the quick-to-build shelters. `` As far as we know, we're ready to go,'' he said, but added that he'll `` believe it when we're on the plane.'' There was no immediate word on when the plane would return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with materials it has picked up in other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. Soviet officials estimate 55,000 lives were lost and 500,000 people were left homeless by the Dec. 7 quake. After hearing of the massive displacement, <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> came up with the idea of using the film for tents. Construction techniques require building frames out of steel and then shrink-wrapping them with resin-based plastic using a propane heat gun. <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> said a tent that can house 30 people takes about two hours to build and includes doors, windows and vents. The arrival of the Soviet plane would end two days of frustration for <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the past two days, I would ` guesstimate' that we've contacted close to 100 people from the secretary of state on down to business people with contacts,'' <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> said, adding he had talked to people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Earlier in the week, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> offered to fly the group, if <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> received permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would have to approve the trip. `` Everybody wanted to be very helpful, but no one seemed able to break through,'' <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON> said. `` We just had to break through the red tape.'' The team intends to go from town to town in the quake area, building five to 10 shelters and teaching the residents how to build more for themselves. `` Then when we get back, we'll be raising money to send more material over there so they can do it themselves,'' said <PERSON> Seraphin </PERSON>. The group had not made plans for their return as of Saturday.

 Striking workers at a government-owned uranium-processing plant voted overwhelmingly Saturday to approve a partial contract settlement with the company that operates the facility, a spokesman said. The settlement will allow 625 workers, who have been on strike since Oct. 7, to return to work Monday, said plant spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. However, about 250 of the workers lost their jobs last week to layoffs resulting from decreased production demands. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said members of 14 unions represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved the agreement by a 3-to-1 ratio. Production at the plant in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, formally known as the Feed Materials Production Center, has been halted since the strike began. The plant, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, processes uranium the government uses in nuclear weapons. Since the strike, the plant has become embroiled in controversy following the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s admission that radioactive material leaked into the environment over a 30-year period. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has pledged itself to a massive cleanup, and recent reports indicate the department is considering closing the facility altogether. The striking workers met Friday and heard details of the proposed settlement. When they struck in October, union leaders said the dispute was not over wages but over fringe benefits and retirement programs. They said the company wanted workers to pay more for benefits. The agreement includes a new health insurance program, but no pay increase. Under the agreement, workers can return to work and pursue up to 4,000 safety and health grievances. <PERSON> Kendell </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, a worker at the plant who has received his layoff notice, said he voted to accept the contract so he could receive his severance benefits. `` I've already received my order saying I'd be let go. I voted for it so I can take the money I'm entitled to, get out and find another job,'' <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said.

 The USS Tennessee, the first nuclear-powered submarine to fire the powerful new Trident 2 missiles, was commissioned into the nation's fleet Saturday. The nation's ninth Trident submarine was hailed as a weapon `` fitted for the demands of modern peace,'' by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who along with other <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> dignitaries were in a crowd of about 1,200 who braved bitter cold to celebrate the submarine's formal entry into the fleet. Nearly 100 anti-nuclear weapons protesters gathered outside the gates of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where the commissioning was held. No protesters were arrested, police said. Members of the Coalition to Stop the Trident had threatened a large demonstration and acts of civil disobedience. Authorities responded by assigning more than 80 police officers to the ceremonies, according to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is the first nuclear-powered submarine designed to fire potent Trident 2 missiles. The missiles have a range of 6,000 miles, and each multiple warhead can strike up to 10 targets. The missile continues to undergo tests, the latest of which was successfully completed Friday at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Tenessee </LOCATION> also is the first vessel to be assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest Trident submarine base at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The other Trident base is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Tenessee </LOCATION> and more recently White House chief of staff, was the keynote speaker. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> also attended the ceremonies. `` Ours is a hard and bitter peace of which President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spoke, a peace guaranteed only by our strength, unquestioned and unsurpassed,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The mission of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> we commission today is to keep that peace,'' he said. Tridents are the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s largest and most powerful weapon. They are 560 feet long and displace 18,700 tons when submerged. Each has 24 missiles and a crew of more than na 150. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the sixth <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Confederate vessel to bear the state's name, was built at the Electric Boat shipyard, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. At the Trident submarine base in <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on Saturday, about 120 people held a vigil to protest the commissioning a continent away of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and its capability of firing Trident 2 missiles The eight Trident submarines at <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, about 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, will be converted to hold Trident 2 missiles within the next few years, said <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Krisko </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, the group that organized the vigil.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Saturday he would do his best to prevent Palestinian terrorist attacks but could not guarantee that some militants would n't step out of line. Palestinian leaders said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> used its first official meeting with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Friday to assure <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> it will pressure its followers to refrain from terrorism. `` We will do all our best to stop all this -LRB- terrorism -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters after returning to his headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. In an apparent reference to some radical Palestinian factions that oppose his strategies, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief said he could not guarantee that `` one person here or one individual there'' might not resort to terrorism. `` Give me one example of any ruler who can have complete control with all the groups,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> serves as an umbrella organization for eight different guerrilla factions which constitute the Palestinians' military arm. The main group is <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, but other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> mount operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its embassies abroad. The factions sometimes fight each other. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, bankrolled by the 21 member states of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, has representatives in about 100 countries. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> added: `` We will use all our efforts and all our influence on our people all over the world not to involve or engage in any operation against civilians, innocent people or Americans.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on Wednesday to drop its ban on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and to open `` a substantive dialogue'' with the group In another boost for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> accepted the credentials of the first ambassador of the newly declared state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, the Algerian government news agency said. In Friday's report based on a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, the ambassador was identified as <PERSON> Moudher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dadjani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> described Friday's 90-minute meeting between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and a four-member <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation as a `` step in the right direction'' toward a `` just and comprehensive settlement.'' `` No peace can be settled without their -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- participation and their efforts,'' he said at a brief news conference. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s main priority in the talks is to push for an early convening of an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say an international conference is no substitute for direct Arab-Israeli talks. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> charged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO contacts by using deadly force against Palestinians. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government is trying to sabotage this dialogue, to stop it,'' he said. He said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials had raised this issue in the talks Friday and urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to halt the use of deadly force against the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, in which more than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also condemned killings in the occupied territories, terming them a `` continuation of state terrorism.'' <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has tightened security measures in recent days for fear of possible attacks by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret services. He said the next round of talks would be held after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office Jan. 20. He said that at the next sessions, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will seek a `` common understanding'' with the Americans on the issue of an international conference, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> statehood and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories. `` We will not have results or solutions in one day,'' <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said. `` It's not like a knockout in boxing. We must go point-by-point.' Last month in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed an independent state, without specifying its borders. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the opening of a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not represent recognition of the state. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, giving a detailed account of Friday's talks, said the Americans outlined their attitude toward terrorism and emphasized that any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terrorism would derail the dialogue. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials on Saturday declined comment on the talks, saying any further comment would come from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said the Palestinian delegates emphasized their opposition to individual, group and state terrorism. `` We will urge all Palestinians individuals and all Palestinian organizations to adopt this strategy for peace,'' he said. `` No one has the right to violate this Palestinian strategy. Any mistake from our side will deteriorate the whole dialogue with the Americans.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to maintain a military presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into the next century in spite of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to abide by the treaties. The Panamanian government statement, issued in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has been following the development of a unilateral thesis in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under which the neutrality treaty would allow a limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> past Dec. 31, 1999.'' The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, signed by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> in 1977, stipulate that on Dec. 31, 1999, `` only the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will operate the canal and maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations inside national territory.'' The Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intention to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after 1999 is `` one of the main reasons for the economic aggression and the threatening use of force against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Asked about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s charges, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said, `` It's not the first time they've said anything like that. They've said it fairly frequently. `` We intend to abide by the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties,'' he added in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have been and we intend to continue to.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> earlier this year and expanded its military force along the canal in an effort to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the armed forces and de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. He denies the accusations. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement alluded to a document issued last week by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> saying that after 1999 `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue showing its determination to support the neutrality and operation of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> as well as regional and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security interests.'' The Southern Command report said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved `` a preliminary plan for an orderly, phased withdrawal from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' but it did not give specific withdrawal dates.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Warns of Further Weapons Plant Shutdowns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department may have to shut more nuclear weapons facilities because President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not proposing enough money to operate them in accordance with safety and environmental laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in its Sunday editions. The newspaper cited a letter in which <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> warned the administration that the proposed 1990 budget fell short by $ 360 million. `` I must in good conscience advise you that ... the system will, in all likelihood, be operating beyond the bounds of acceptable risk,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in the Dec. 9 letter to White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>. Spokespersons for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the White House were not available for comment after the story appeared. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the letter contains a detailed assessment of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s budgetary problems, which <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said may require choosing between upgrading plant safety and meeting the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s production goals for nuclear materials. If the department gives priority to production goals, the paper quoted <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, `` then unresolved environmental and safety issues are likely to lead to further shutdowns in the weapons complex.'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s letter cites years of budget austerity combined with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> military buildup that put more demands on the system. `` Part of today's problem stems from our attempts to stretch, defer and absorb budgetary shortfalls, hoping that next year things would be better and we could catch up,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. `` As a result, the country's ability to produce and maintain a nuclear weapons stockpile is in serious jeopardy,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in the letter. `` The risk is great that without a significant increase in resources over the next five years, we will no longer be able to sustain a strong nuclear deterrent in which we have invested $ 57 billion since 1980.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 17 weapons plants, has proposed spending $ 50 billion in the next 20 years to build new facilities and correct the most pressing environmental problems. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> his department would pay for $ 200 million in upgrades at its <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plants, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, by using the last of a contingency fund. He said the action will reduce the fund `` to zero'' and leave no cushion for emergencies. In addition, the department has said it will help clear up a nuclear waste problem endangering the operation of the Denver-area <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, which handles plutonium. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s letter, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, indicated the department is in line for a $ 900 million budget increase next year _ more than 8 percent higher than its current $ 12 billion budget. The secretary said the problems at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and Rocky Flats will result in a $ 360 million shortfall, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14 Tomcat jet fighter landing at <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> crashed into another F-14 on a runway, veering off into the 12-foot deep <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estuary </ORGANIZATION>. The pilot and a radar officer ejected from the plane Friday before it hit the water on and were rescued apparently unhurt, but were hospitalized for possible shock, officials said. On Saturday, the fighter was lifted from the waterway, damaged but in one piece, by a huge crane. It was taken to a nearby pier at the <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>. Earlier, officials had said they thought the plane had shattered on impact. The $ 30 million jet, the type featured in the hit movie `` Top Gun,'' crashed on the north end of the air station's north-south runway. The air station is located on the eastern side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. One crew member was rescued about half an hour later by a passing tugboat and the second by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescue boat, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Two F-14s landed without incident before a third plane struck the second one and veered into the estuary, <PERSON> Valente </PERSON> said. The planes were from <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, he added. The two crew members in the second plane, which remained on the runway, walked away from the crash, unhurt, <PERSON> Valente </PERSON> said. The plane lost part of its right wing, but officials said they had n't determined the cost of damage or whether the plane could be repaired The F-14 is a large and powerful aircraft that in 1972 became the standard fleet fighter aboard aircraft carriers at sea. Visible damage to the aircraft after it was pulled from the water included a missing hatch and part of the nose, officials said.

<HEAD>Another Crack Found in Reactor at Troubled Savannah River Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A small crack has been discovered in a cooling pipe at a reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> nuclear facility, but it should not affect next summer's scheduled restart of the reactor, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Saturday. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s acting assistant manager for reactor operations, said that the crack in the 4-inch pipe occurred in a weld area where two pipes join, the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB- Chronicle reported in Sunday's editions. The pipe supplies cooling water to reactor control rods, which are raised and lowered within the reactor vessel to control the fission process. <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON> said the crack was detected Friday by ultrasonic tests during a routine check of the reactor's piping. He said he thought this was the first crack found in the reactor's piping this year. All three <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> reactors _ known as the K, L and P reactors _ have been shut down since summer for safety upgrades and maintenance. They are the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons. Because tritium decays 5.5 percent annually, some federal officials say the nation could face forced reductions in nuclear weapons unless the reactors are restarted soon. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary for safety, health and quality assurance, said he was sending a team of experts to the weapons plant next week to assess the situation, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON> said replacing the pipe would not delay restart `` because we have the time to do it ... and especially because it's a smaller pipe. The K Reactor crack was discovered the same day <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said a separate crack found earlier in the L Reactor presented no major safety problems and could have been caused by nearby welding. Sections of pipe are replaced when a crack penetrates more than 50 percent of a pipe wall's thickness, or covering more than 20 percent of the pipe's circumference. The L Reactor pipe was removed under that rule, and the pipe in the K reactor found cracked Friday will be replaced even though it does not meet the criteria, the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> paper reported.

 Rescuers found 21 people alive in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> more than a week after they were buried in an earthquake, and officials said the discovery persuaded them to extend the search for survivors. An Armenian official told a Politburo commission overseeing rescue operations that of the 135 people pulled from ruins, 21 were saved. His report was shown on Soviet television Friday night. `` In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> 110 were pulled out, and 20 were alive. In <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, only one was alive,'' said the official, who was not identified. He said the survivors were found Thursday. The discovery of one person still alive in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> spurred searchers there to continue looking for another 10 days, said the official. It was not clear how large an area would be included in the continued search.

 Political maverick <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says his conviction of tax and mail fraud conspiracy is `` a wrong, gross, disgusting, obscene miscarriage of justice,'' and predicted he will die a martyr's death if sent to prison. `` They do n't want a living political martyr in prison, they want a dead one,'' said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, claiming he was the victim of a hate campaign by the news media and a frameup by a pro-Soviet `` friends of glasnost'' clique in the Justice and State departments. After less than 12 hours of deliberation, a federal trial jury on Friday found <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy for raising more than $ 30 million in loans from supporters without any intention of repaying them.

 The $ 516 million-per-plane pricetag for the B-2 stealth bomber makes it the most expensive aircraft ever built, but <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> says whatever the radar-evading plane costs, it's worth it.
