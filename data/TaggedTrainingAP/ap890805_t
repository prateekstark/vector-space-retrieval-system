 A researcher who spends his time studying roadside trash has found that most litterbugs are men. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Syrek </PERSON>, whose research provided the basis for a cleanup campaign that cut roadside littering by 60 percent in the state since 1985, discovered that men did most of the littering, and they `` do n't respond positively when you use the word ` please' in telling them to stop.'' Some Texans found the `` Do n't Mess With <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' campaign a tad macho, but it worked, said <PERSON> Syrek </PERSON>, who evaluates roadside litter for 16 state governments. With his on-site inspections, <PERSON> Syrek </PERSON> found that men did 70 percent of all deliberate littering, `` and 90 percent of all accidental littering _ where things fly off the bed of a pickup truck, for example _ involve male drivers,'' he said. Seventy-five percent of the men involved were younger than 35. The $ 2 million advertising campaign has included appearances by country singer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, football players and other celebrities. Studying roadside trash is a good way to see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Syrek </PERSON> said. `` There is some incredibly beautiful countryside that we get to see in detail,'' said <PERSON> Syrek </PERSON>. `` At least, we do when the litter is gone.''

 Only three Republicans are left in this town, jokes the man who started the annual <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> footrace, `` and one of them is in bad health.''

And here, in his adopted home, we did n't even have a monument.'' There was opposition to the festival, <PERSON> Kotfila </PERSON> said. `` I think there may be three Republicans left in town and one of them is in bad health,'' he said. `` A lot of people found it hard to believe that we were trying to resurrect <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> and thought we should leave well enough alone.''

 Renewed threats to abortion rights should be viewed as a significant opportunity to unify the women's movement, speakers told the National Women's Political Caucus `` We must bring the same spirit to the fight for abortion rights that we brought to the fight for the ERA -LRB- Equal Rights Amendment -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, told the caucus' biennial convention on Friday. `` That means leaving no state unturned. It means the same grunt work this caucus did in state after state for the ERA. There is no shortcut, no magic pill, no easy way,'' she said. `` Ironically, despite internal and perhaps inevitable disagreement over tactics, this issue can and will bring greater unity.'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congresswoman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a founder of the 18-year-old caucus, said they expect abortion will be the issue that prompts young women to join the fight for women's rights in numbers not seen since the movement's peak during the 1970s It presents `` an opportunity to revitalize the movement so it may complete the mammoth job that remains to secure women their rights and their freedoms,'' said <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, former chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said the caucus `` must not underestimate the need for a resilient, confident mass movement of broad appeal if we are to prevail on the troublesome issue of reproductive choices.'' But, she added, `` we must avoid the single-issue ... approach of the anti-choice crowd'' when seeking to stop efforts to impose abortion restrictions authorized by a recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> said the threat of abortion restrictions will mobilize the nation's young people like no issue since the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War: `` Abortion is the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of this generation for young people everywhere.'' A woman's right to decide whether to have children `` free from intrusion or coercion by government or church or the outright violence of any individual is as precious and individual a liberty as the right to speak and the right to believe and the right to pray,'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> said. Without the free exercise of that right, she said, `` no woman can be deemed to be fully free or equal.'' `` The idea that the unborn fetus is -LRB- entitled to -RRB- protection from the moment of conception is biologically ignorant and philosophically outrageous,'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> said. `` No civilized nation can be allowed to declare an unborn fetus to be a person under the Constitution before women are declared to be persons under the Constitution.'' Although the number of women holding elective and appointive offices has increased during the past two decades, the gains have been incremental, <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> said. `` At the rate we're going it will take 410 years to get equal numbers of men and women in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` We have ... allowed ourselves to lower our sights and lower our demands. I believe we have to begin thinking in new ways.'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> suggested asking both political parties to commit all open seats to women until equity is reached in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House and pursuing the idea of having one of each state's two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators be a woman.

 Singer Billie Holiday and tenor saxophonist <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> were remembered by three singers and three tenor players at the opening of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s third annual `` Classical Jazz'' series. The first of six concerts, each centered around outstanding figures from the history of jazz, was sold out Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Alice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tully </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>. The performers were <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Person </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Buck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, who had the longest set, has an individual timbre, sounding not at all like Billie Holiday. Her delivery is warm, open and generous. She seems a balance of tough and vulnerable and she seems to be giving of herself. She's mesmerizing, pulling the audience with her into the world of Billie Holiday's songs. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> and each member of Miss <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s trio stretched out in interesting solos. <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> <PERSON> Person </PERSON>, who have been performing together since 1976, have their pattern set with his sax providing melodic fills between her lines of singing. Miss <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> wraps her words and syllables around the instrumental music, the way Miss Holiday did. She also had a trio on stage. Pianist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Braham </PERSON> captured the imagination. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> played her own piano accompaniment, with bassist and drummer. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> played saxophone with them on every other song. Miss <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>'s approach is lightness. If the other two singers were airplanes, she was a glider, touching down occasionally. Then right away, and in no hurry, she'd lift off again.

 Hurricane Dean drifted northward Friday in the open <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> after veering away from northern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands and the southeastern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, forecasters said. `` It may strengthen a little bit.

The hurricane was moving north at about 12 mph, forecasters said. `` Our latest reconnaissance positions indicate that indeed it may start a little bit more fast speed toward the north, and you can see that on the satellite,'' Sheets said. A weakening of upper atmosphere currents that steer the storm kept <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> away from the islands Thursday, after it initially headed toward the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The hurricane was moving very slowly. `` We're still expecting it to turn to the north and then eventually go to the northeast,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Groups Regain Offensive With Defiance Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sidestepping an array of state-of-emergency bans, the militant core of the anti-apartheid movement is back on the offensive with a defiance campaign that has government leaders groping for a response. Crushing the campaign by force could wreck the government's ongoing initiatives to improve its international standing Allowing unchecked civil disobedience could fuel widespread black activism and a white backlash against the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in advance of parliamentary elections next month. The campaign, launched Wednesday when about 270 blacks and <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> sought and received treatment at segregated white hospitals, is led by many of the activists who have been detained or restricted during the 3-year-old state of emergency. `` People have decided to take the matter into their own hands,'' said <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, a lawyer involved in the campaign. The campaign's leaders have designated themselves and their various organizations as the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a loose alliance which in effect takes the place of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> was banned in February 1988, and by late last year, activists were conceding that the emergency crackdown had seriously weakened their organizational prowess. The first sign of a resurgence came in January, when <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> affiliates helped organize hunger strikes by hundreds of detained black activists. Faced with the prospect of detainees starving to death without ever being charged, the government chose to free virtually all those held under emergency regulations. Now comes the defiance campaign, which envisions the first sustained use of mass civil disobedience in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the 1950s. Its masterminds are activists who have proved their resilience and persistence. Two of the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s key leaders are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> officials who escaped from detention to sanctuary at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate last year. The government allowed them to emerge without the restrictions imposed on many other <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Another key component of the new movement is the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation, which has defied a government decree barring it from political activity. The government may have trouble responding decisively to the defiance campaign because of a partial power vaccuum at the top. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> will retire after the Sept. 6 election, and neither he nor his designated successor, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, has been eager to make bold moves in recent weeks. The government's point man in coping with the defiance campaign is Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. He asserted last month the organizers sought to provoke violence and had endorsed hand-grenade attacks on election candidates. The Mass Democratic Movement denied the allegations and mocked <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> after the hospital protest proceeded peacefully, with minimal disruption to health services. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> belittled the protest as `` political pestering'' but said further acts of defiance `` are a time-bomb that could explode at any moment.'' Health Minister <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Niekerk </PERSON> complained that sick blacks had been used as pawns and said no hospitals elsewhere in `` the civilized world'' would be targeted by protesters. Anti-apartheid leaders agreed, saying no civilized country's hospitals would be racially segregated. The Mass Democratic Movement says the defiance campaign will be extended soon to other targets, possibly segregated schools and recreation facilities. <LOCATION> Mineworkers </LOCATION> have begun protesting workplace segregation and 17 former detainees in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> said they would defy the restrictions imposed when they were freed. The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, conceded in an editorial Friday the activists `` scored a propaganda victory, highlighting segregation at white hospitals, issuing defiant statements and challenging the authorities without suffering any serious consequences.'' The Citizen said the government might regret its decision to avoid a pre-emptive crackdown on the protest's organizers. The government's dilemma has been aggravated by the fact that its current policy documents repudiate racial discrimination. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> himself declared during the week that `` apartheid is no longer the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' If <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> was speaking the truth, said <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION>, then the defiance campaign would only be of help.

 More than 50 people were injured when a crowd trying to get into a standing-room-only area for a Friday evening grandstand concert at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> pressed into the area before it was opened. State Highway Patrol troopers at the scene said most of the injuries were minor. <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, director of public relations, said 58 people were treated at the fair; about a dozen later were taken to hospitals. Doctors' Hospital North nursing supervisor <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Crader </PERSON> said eight teen-agers were treated for minor injuries. `` I think there was one broken foot, but it was pretty minor stuff. There were varying complaints,'' she said. After the disturbance, Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> met with fair officials and managers of the acts scheduled to appear Friday night. Following the meeting, the manager for one of the acts, New Kids on the Block, announced that the entertainment would be presented one act at a time, and if authorities felt the crowd was getting unruly, the rest of the show would be canceled. After the announcement, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> walked along the perimeter of the grandstand, telling concertgoers to `` Be cool and pass it back.'' Trooper <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Esslinger </PERSON> said he could not estimate the size of the crowd for the 8 p.m. concert. The crowd had been building all day, and the grandstand was largely filled by late afternoon, witnesses said. The standing-room-only area had not been opened when the crowd broke for the seats, witnesses said. A thunderstorm broke shortly after the crowd rushed into the area, adding to the confusion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed and sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> early Saturday a landmark savings and loan bailout providing tens of billions of dollars to cover the losses of savers whose deposits disappeared in a wave of fraudulent lending. By 201-175, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the $ 159 billion financial rescue _ the biggest in the nation's history _ following a frantic 48 hours of negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure only two hours earlier, giving President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a victory on his first and biggest legislative initiative since taking office last January as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recesses for a month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had agreed in advance to the compromise, the second in as many days. The bill provides $ 50 billion over the next three years to close and merge 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls and pay off savers whose billions of dollars in government insured deposits were lost to failed and often fraudulent loans, most of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It also totally overhauls the regulation of the industry to try to fulfill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise that `` never again'' will taxpayers be asked to pay for losses. S & amp; L owners will be required to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk as a buffer between risky loans and the federal deposit insurance funds. The administration lobbied <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans throughout the day to provide the winning margin as Democrats defected from the bill in large numbers in response to a compromise hiding most of the cleanup costs off the budget and out of the official federal deficit. Republicans in the House supported the bill 119-40 while Democrats opposed it 135-82. Fifty-one members did not vote and five voted `` present.'' Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., accused <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of losing their conscience and their backbone in bowing to a veto threat from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and agreeing to financing the bulk of the bailout's costs through 30-year bonds `` It should have been paid for by taxes, but the president could not bring himself to say the word,'' said <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>. `` So we have fostered this unconscionable debt on our children and grandchildren.'' But with the losses of federally insured deposits mounting at a rate of $ 20 million to $ 30 million a day, supporters said it would be equally unconscionable for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to go on vacation without fixing the problem. `` I for one do n't want to take the chance of another bank-holiday crisis,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, referring to the wave of bank closings at the end of the <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> administration in early 1933 that deepened the Great Depression. `` The alternative are unthinkable,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` The savings of million of Americans are at stake unless we do something,'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, D-Mo., said just before the unusual `` divison'' vote in which supporters and opponents indicate their position by standing The procedure leaves no record of who votes yes or no. But four senators stood in opposition and three others asked to be recorded as opponents. They were Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, R-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I think it is the best bill possible to craft under the circumstances,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the `` It will make major reforms in every area.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the phone with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from both parties throughout the day, according to sources, pleading for support. And Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was dispatched to the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to negotiate a resolve to the impasse. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former appointed Republican senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, spent nearly an hour on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor lobbying former colleagues. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> took the bill the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor only after <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reached an accord on off-budget bonds <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> had demanded that the off-budget bonds to be used for much of the financing be registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as carrying a risk higher than normal government securities.

 The crowd of people seeking favors from former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> included his successor and one of his most vocal critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, according to reports published Friday. Four-dozen boxes of documents from <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eight-year tenure at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> contained mounds of requests for his time or help, the reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, report that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> became involved in selected cases at the behest of political associates. In testimony before a congressional subcommittee in May, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he did n't do special favors for consultants or developers and had merely instructed subordinates to give personal requests `` careful consideration.'' Among the documents released to the newspapers were numerous letters asking <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for help or thanking him for the department's approval of one project or another The reports did not specify in every case whether <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> himself interceded on behalf of those who sought his help. According to the Journal, among those who wrote <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> were <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary who at the time was a congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>; Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>; and Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat who has been one of the most outspoken critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the influence peddling that existed at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure In its Saturday editions, the Times said the documents also showed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials withheld from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> records that showed the extent of political favoritism in the award of federal subsidies for low-income housing. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., asked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in early 1988 for two years of records on the awarding of the subsidies The documents show <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> was given data only for a four-month period after the program had been revised to curb political abuses, the Times said. The newspapers quoted a letter from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, in which the former <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary thanked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for his support of a suburban <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> housing project that was awarded $ 28 million in Section 8 moderate rehabilitation funds in May 1986. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> was paid $ 300,000 by the developer of the project to help obtain money from Housing and Urban Development and, according to previous testimony, had met with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to discuss the project. `` Thanks!'' <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on June 6, 1986. `` You are a man of your word.'' Asked for comment by the Times, <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> referred to his congressional testimony last spring in which he said his contacts with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> were proper. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> faces no charges of wrongdoing, but congressional investigators have questioned the truthfulness of some of his testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> could not be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
 A judge has issued a succinct order to the creators of a parody of Cliff's Notes, the yellow-and-black booklets that have aided generations of struggling students by condensing <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>: Change it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kram </PERSON> ruled this week that the upcoming satire looks too much like the real thing, and that the parodists can not use any cover that might be confused with <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>'s Notes The decision was described as unprecedented by <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trager </PERSON>, lawyer for the parody's publisher, <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>. She moved to seek an expedited appeal of the ruling, as well as an immediate stay. `` If this ruling is upheld, it will deal a significant blow to free speech and First Amendment liberties and will endanger the viability of parody as a literary form,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president and publisher of Doubleday. Ms. <PERSON> Trager </PERSON> said that although the judge did not enjoin the production of any parody, her restrictions on the cover meant exactly that. Recreating the appearance of the subject is `` the essence of parody,'' she said, and a parody of Cliff's Notes without a yellow-and-black cover would be like a parody of Time magazine without a red border up front. The satire, `` Spy Notes,'' was produced by the editors of Spy magazine, a brash <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> humor monthly, and was to reach bookstore shelves next month. It ridicules and boils down trendy best sellers like `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' and `` Less Than Zero.'' Like this on `` Less Than Zero'' _ `` Clay meets <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> and Rip at a nightclub called The Roxy. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> takes them all to see a dead body in an alleyway. Then they all go to Rip's house, where there is a delirious, naked 12-year-old girl tied to a bed.'' It also offers `` Questions for Review,'' `` Biographical Notes'' and `` Suggestions for Further Reading,'' mostly a listing of gossip-column appearances of authors <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tama </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowitz </PERSON>. The cover is yellow with black stripes, and the titles of the `` summarized'' works are in the same block letters used on Cliff's Notes covers But instead of the mountain depicted in the lower right corner of real Cliff's Notes, Spy Notes features a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> skyline. In addition, the words `` A SATIRE'' are printed nine times in pink letters on the Spy Notes cover. After Cliff's <ORGANIZATION> Notes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> learned of Spy's plans, the company went to court to seek an injunction against the parody's cover. Cliff's claimed the parody was a trademark violation which would confuse the public. The company's product has been used by generations of college and high school students who either failed to read assigned works or failed to understand them. In its complaint, Cliff's Notes noted `` the excellence of its literary works'' gave it `` an outstanding reputation and acceptance among members of the public throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The judge said she disagreed with <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>'s theory that `` the First Amendment gives the parodist unbridled freedom to use a registered trademark as part of a parody or satire.'' She found that the Spy Notes cover design and Cliff's Notes trademark cover `` are similar to a degree that would cause consumer confusion.'' `` Consumers could believe that <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>'s was satirizing Spy, that Spy was a division of Cliff's, or that <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>'s licensed Spy,'' she said. The judge agreed with <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>'s that Spy Notes `` goes far beyond ` conjuring up' the Cliff's Notes image, and instead merely copies it with minor differences added in an attempt to avoid trademark violations.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, lawyer for Cliff's, said his client `` is as much entitled to the First Amendment protection as Doubleday is. It would be a perverse injustice if someone in the name of the First Amendment was able to take a trademarked cover design and be immune from liability.'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, co-editor of Spy, said the judge's ruling defied understanding. `` It's a shocking and puzzling decision ...,'' he said. `` I do n't see how anyone could possibly confuse the two.''

<HEAD>New Early-Diagnosis Test Finds AIDS Virus Instead of Body's Reaction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> is marketing a new test that detects the AIDS virus rather than the body's response to the virus and can reveal infection weeks earlier than currently used tests, the company said Friday. AIDS-virus tests now in use detect the presence of antibodies _ proteins manufactured by white blood cells to fight invading organisms. Antibodies usually appear in a person's system six to 10 weeks after infection. The new test detects AIDS antigens _ proteins on the surface of the invading virus. The new test can signal the presence of the antigens about two weeks after infection, a spokesman for the North Chicago-based company said. ` This test complements the antibody test. It does not replace the antibody test,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, associate professor of medicine and director of the HIV treatment program at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center Test was approved Thursday for commercial sale by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, making it the only approved test for the AIDS virus in the country. Though antigens are the first detectable sign of infection, they effectively `` disappear'' with the appearance of antibodies, which remain in the body. The antigen test is thus not always able to reveal the presence of infection. Antigens only reappear when the virus becomes more active, a possible signal that the infected person will get sick, either with immune problems, with a mild form of AIDS known as AIDS-related complex or with full-blown AIDS, said <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>. To identify which infected people are likely to develop symptoms _ some may be infected for years without any symptoms _ doctors can check patients with the new test every three or four months, said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. `` If you come up where the antigen test is positive, that might be the opportune moment to intervene with AZT or some form of antiviral therapy,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. AZT, or zidovudine, is the only drug approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for fighting AIDS. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said antigen-positive patients have a 75 percent chance of developing symptoms, compared with 29 percent for antigen-negative patients. The new test, available under the trade name HIV AG-1, is already under manufacture because is has previously been used to monitor the effectiveness of AZT. It will continue to be valuable for that purpose, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said the test will probably cost $ 100 to $ 120 at the lab, which is `` not out of line'' with other laboratory tests for viruses.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved an historic savings and loan rescue plan early Saturday after the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly approved a $ 286.5 billion military spending bill, ignoring President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto threat. In the rush to complete its work before a monthlong recess, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the compromise $ 159 billion savings and loan bailout plan and sent it to the House. The S & amp; L vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first and biggest legislative initiative was anti-climactic, without even a roll call. A sharply divided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 201-175 just moments after midnight. At the outset of its more than 15-hour lawmaking marathon, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 312-105 to adopt military appropriations legislation. The measure would cut $ 1.8 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, strictly curtail production of the B-2 bomber and eliminate all funds for the Midgetman nuclear missile, the advanced tactical fighter and cruise missile. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto the bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also passed legislation on financial liability for oil spills, aid to farmers hit by the drought and a temporary $ 70 billion extension to the $ 2.8 trillion federal debt limit, which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had approved earlier. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pushed for speedy action on a series of bills, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, about <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delays on 120 of his appointments. `` The president wanted to register his deep concern that these were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the candidates themselves,'' presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the White House. The `` artificial reasons,'' according to administration officials and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., are party politics Among the nominations the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not yet acted on are <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who has been linked to the Iran-Contra affair, as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and several nominees to the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> Away from the legislative action and White House complaints, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee said it had decided to investigate three lawmakers accused of sexual improprieties. The committee voted in secret session Thursday to conduct preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was convicted in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a He was sentenced June 30 to 180 days in jail and fined $ 1,000 for having sex with a teen-age girl. Two former aides to <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> have filed a complaint alleging he sexually harassed female members of his staff. Three Democrats filed a complaint against <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> after news reports said a Peace Corps volunteer complained the congressman fondled her while he was traveling in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, D-Minn., disclosed that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has completed a preliminary inquiry of his previously disclosed book contract that an opponent claimed was a device to circumvent limits on fee income The senator said the committee had decided to proceed with its investigation. The last major legislative battle before the recess concerned the thrift bailout. A tenuous compromise with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, agreed to late Thursday night, was threatened as key House Democrats announced opposition. In particular, they objected to financing provisions that would keep much of the cost of the bailout outs they said, add substantially to the overall expense to be borne by taxpayers. With savings and loan losses mounting at a rate of $ 20 million or more a day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote to the lawmakers, `` Final passage remains critical to the stability and solvency of the financial system.'' The landmark bill would close or merge hundreds of insolvent savings institutions. Setting the stage for the difficult task of deciding the S & amp; L bailout, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moved quickly on the defense appropriations bill that largely conformed to the military authorization plan passed by the chamber last week. Despite word from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget office that the president's senior advisers would recommend a veto, and a similar assessment from the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the chamber gave overwhelming approval to the plan. In fact, the vote for the appropriations plan _ 312-105 _ amounted to a stronger statement than the 261-162 approval of the authorization bill. `` They have conformed,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said of the two pieces of legislation. `` But that still makes it veto-bait in my opinion.'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he hoped that when members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meet early in September to craft a final version of the bill, the `` most egregious add-ons and deletions can be modified and limited to make it acceptable to the administration.'' Among the other final-day action taken by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 to increase industry's financial liability for oil spills, create a nationwide system to clean up such accidents and establish a $ 1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages The vote came less than five months after the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> struck a reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, spilling 11 million gallons of oil. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a compromise plan providing $ 895 million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the drought and other weather-related problems <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have indicated that the president will sign the legislation.

<TEXT>
 Three state child-welfare workers were suspended and a fourth has quit following the death of a 2-year-old boy whose parents allegedly dunked him repeatedly in a toilet for soiling his diapers. The workers ignored guidelines in returning <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> to his mother and stepfather, ignoring warnings that they were abusing the boy, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> died of a brain hemorrhage July 28, shortly after the HRS workers returned the boy to his parents from foster care. <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, 22, both of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, were held without bond Friday facing first-degree murder charges in the case. HRS Secretary <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Coler </PERSON> said he was upset that the staffers recommended the child be returned to the Coes despite the abuse reports and their failure to fulfill an agreement to attend drug-abuse counseling. `` We're not talking about facts that were n't known or somebody who did n't show up somewhere or that the information was n't there,'' <PERSON> Coler </PERSON> said Thursday, the day of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s funeral `` We're talking about people not following procedure. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was taken from the Coes' custody in March 1988 after HRS officials said the Coes had been negligent. He was returned to them in late May despite the warnings of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s foster parents, the <LOCATION> Kirklands </LOCATION>. The foster parents said they repeatedly told HRS workers that they feared <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> would be in danger if returned to the Coes. Three child-welfare workers involved in the case, case worker <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, her supervisor <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, and subdistrict administrator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadyen </PERSON>, have been put on a 10-day, paid leave. Case worker <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBoise </PERSON> quit, <ORGANIZATION> HRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Konicki </PERSON> said Thursday. After a closed meeting Friday with angry parents in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, HRS district administrator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said HRS has `` got to intensify the review effort of supervisors in high-level supervision, so we fully understand the complexities in the case.'' The parents who requested the meeting have been protesting for the past several days in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> with placards in the downtown area, criticizing HRS' handling of such cases. They also held a candlelight ceremony along the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> riverfront Thursday night on behalf of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and other child-abuse victims.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Fabrication of Quotes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A psychologist intends to appeal a federal court ruling that allows a journalist quoting a public figure to make up a quote if the quote does not `` alter the substantive content'' of what was said. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled on Friday that <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Masson </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Freud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, could not sue writer <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> for $ 10.2 million over a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine article and book that allegedly quoted him as saying many things he never said. The purported quotes included <PERSON> Masson </PERSON>'s self-description as an `` intellectual gigolo,'' his comment that after <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Freud </PERSON> he would be regarded as `` the greatest analyst who ever lived,'' and a statement that he would have turned the <PERSON> Freud </PERSON> house into `` a place of sex, women, fun.'' In a libel suit by a public figure, who must prove that harmful statements were deliberately or recklessly false, quotations can be fabricated if they are `` rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks'' or `` do not alter the substantive content of unambiguous remarks,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>. He was joined in his opinion by Judge <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. But the dissenter in the 2-1 decision, Judge <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON>, said fabricated quotes were the equivalent of lies. `` If authors are given license to invent quotations on the basis of what they perceive to be a speaker's character, there are no words whatsoever that they can not put into a subject's mouth,'' <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> and her publishers, said the ruling vindicates his clients. He said they never conceded that any quotes had been made up or changed, other than `` a word here and a word there.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleven </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Masson </PERSON>, said the ruling would be appealed. `` We do n't think there's any need to allow that sort of alteration to protect the values that the First Amendment is designed to protect,'' he said. <PERSON> Masson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> resident, was fired in 1981 as director of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Freud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was fired and fell out of favor among psychoanalysts because he had written that <PERSON> Freud </PERSON>, the father of modern pscyhoanalysis, knew the evidence was to the contrary when he declared that women usually fantasized claims of childhood sexual abuse. His suit attacked <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>'s 1983 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> article, `` Trouble in the Archives,'' and her 1984 book, `` In the <ORGANIZATION> Freud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>,'' on the struggle between <PERSON> Masson </PERSON> and directors of the archives over his views on <PERSON> Freud </PERSON>. <PERSON> Masson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> had maliciously painted a false picture of him by fabricating quotes, citing numerous statements that were not in her tape-recorded interviews.

<TEXT>
 One of the most vociferous, revealing and at the same time very ugly events this week took place in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. This can reveal the face of the hegemonistic powers of the world. See how ugly the issue is. A country by the name of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which is from the root up an usurper, officially enters a town with military forces, with a helicopter, and takes the Friday prayer leader of the town along with two of his security men. This is not at all acceptable by any international standard, and no country can say this is right. No international law can condone this action. A country can not enter another country, kidnap and leave ... and then confess to it. OK, it used to do this and not confess, it would deny it. This was n't boastfulness. It was a crime, but not boasting. But it confessed. It announced. This is to make a laughingstock of all those individuals who adhere by international laws. What happened in return? Some innocent people, whose identity is n't even known. A number of unknown people combating covertly, announced that a person they had -LRB- been keeping -RRB- as a spy had been killed. They hanged him in revenge. Their reason was that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s agent, and we will take our revenge on this American person whom we have captive, and who is implicated in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crime, in return for Mr. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. This was what they said. Then they threatened that they would kill the rest -LRB- of the hostages -RRB- too, if you do n't free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 So what should we do in this situation? Here there is one clear point and a somber point: The clear point is that a government has officially confessed, confessed to all about its crime. The somber point is that a group has killed someone, who may be innocent, but we do n't know, therefore we will not make any judgment on this. We do n't even know who he is, and so we do n't make any judgment And we do n't know this group either, whether they are righteous people or not, who they are. We only know only that the people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are innocent people. And innocent people can not be condemned without reason. ...

<TEXT>
 Global arrogance -LRB- The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-, if it wanted to do something, it would have been clear: It should take <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the collar and say free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> so that the issue is finished. If you take a criminal and ask him to stop his crimes, this is popular in the world. They might say, `` No, this does n't concern us and we are no match for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' This is not acceptable to us. No one accepts this. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself does not accept this, the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> do n't accept this. If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> really wants to stop <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> it must announce, it must say, `` Until <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is freed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid will be stopped.'' This Congress that convenes in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, these bigwigs that sit and vote there, this is the way you should vote. Why do you think so crookedly, and speak so arrogantly? Instead of going after a self-confessed, known, boastful criminal, you order that your warships gather from around the world toward innocent <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. ...

 What kind of idiots are you? See how ugly the world is? See how the idiotic are the politicians who rule the world? If they want to solve the problems of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> there are ways, the ways are clear; they do n't want to solve the problems, they are not prepared to stop backing Maronite rule in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are still hoping, waiting for the day to have a Maronite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One Jewish <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, one Maronite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. ...

<TEXT>
 I state, I tell the White House, the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions. These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems. Come let us enter reasonably, we too will help solve the problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace and harmony.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is in a `` holding pattern'' as it pins its hopes on continued diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis involving hostages held by Moslem extremists, an official said. The administration on Friday voiced optimism, tinged with caution, at the promise of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, to help find a solution to the hostage situation. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would explore the overture `` to the fullest.'' `` I do n't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment, but there's reason to be somewhat encouraged,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said about <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s Still, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` always skeptical of what we hear from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' while <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> sounded a slightly more positive reaction. `` Based on the excerpts we have seen, President <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s remarks appear to be moderate and are therefore encouraging,'' she said `` We have reason to believe that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is genuinely engaged and no reason to believe that its engagement is not focused in a positive direction.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which does not have direct relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was using <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> as an intermediary to seek help from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, generally believed to wield influence with the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers, officials said. The president also called the head of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cornelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommaruga </PERSON>, on Friday to voice support for the agency's involvement in trying to free the hostages, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> were alluded to by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> when he said he would help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> find solutions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of a `` very extraordinarily broad exercise of diplomacy here in the last couple of days'' during which aides said he has appealed to dozens of world leaders for help. The diplomatic efforts are continuing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Another administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` It's in a holding pattern,'' while the administration watches for its diplomatic overtures to produce results. No new messages went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Friday, the official said. During a photo session, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about the massing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval strength in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> as a possible indicator he had decided to retaliate militarily if another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage was killed. `` If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last place I'd be talking about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had selected specific Lebanese targets to hit if kidnappers had carried out a threat to kill American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. `` I will say he did not make final decisions,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It does not help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be discussing military tactics ... to be flexing our muscles in public.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was he was `` certainly pleased'' that the kidnappers on Thursday indefinitely suspended their death threat against <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. `` I'm encouraged. But I do n't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again, to have those hopes dashed. This is a brutal process, where you see people paraded before cameras and their families get their hopes up,'' the president said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> capped a pre-vacation flurry of fiscal action by giving final approval of a bailout for the savings and loan industry early today and by granting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for an increase in the national debt limit After weeks of intense wrangling and a last-minute legislative showdown, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the S & amp; L bill without a roll call. Shortly after midnight, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> then sent the package to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a narrow 201-175 vote, with most of the chamber's ruling Democrats voting against. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to sign the 1,000-page legislation, which would overhaul the thrift industry. One of the biggest hangups on the S & amp; L bill was its impact on the federal deficit and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to keep the $ 159 billion cost `` off-budget.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won a compromise from the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by threatening a veto. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also gave voice vote approval and sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a bill temporarily adding $ 70 billion in new borrowing authority to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s current credit limit of $ 2.8 trillion. The interim debt bill, which would expire Oct. 31, was approved earlier in the week by the House. The bill is needed because a permanent debt ceiling increase to more than $ 3 trillion has bogged down in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and without more borrowing authority the government would default on its obligations this month. The permanent debt bill is expected to become a legislative vehicle for a variety of amendments in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns next month for its fall meeting. Earlier Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ignored threats of a possible veto and passed a $ 286.5 billion military spending bill that would slash billions of dollars from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategic weapons programs. The bill, approved 312-105, would cut $ 1.8 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, strictly curtail production of the B-2 bomber and eliminate all funds for the Midgetman nuclear missile, the advanced tactical fighter and cruise missile. Also Friday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved an $ 18.4 billion spending bill for fiscal 1989 operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and other government agencies The bill was approved only after a controversial amendment to restore <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s military pension was put off until the fall, when it will be taken up as a separate bill. Among the items in the spending bill is $ 200,000 to remodel the Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s official residence, to better accommodate his young family. The measure contains $ 5.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, $ 300 million more than this year, and $ 1.3 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, $ 100 million above 1989 spending. It also aims to prevent credit card companies from joining with charities to seek business, and thus taking advantage of subsidized mail rates. Another part of the bill would suspend for one year enforcement of a tax law designed to encourage companies to give health insurance to low-level workers. Business groups have complained that the requirement is expensive and time-consuming. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee announced it will conduct preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was convicted in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a child for having sex with a Two former aides to <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> have filed a complaint alleging he sexually harassed female members of his staff. Three Democrats filed a complaint against <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> after news reports said a Peace Corps volunteer complained the congressman fondled her while he was traveling in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. _ Sen <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, D-Minn., said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has decided to proceed with its investigation of his book contract that an opponent claimed was used to circumvent limits on outside income _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in a bill reacting to the Exxon Valdez disaster, voted 99-0 to increase industry's financial liability for oil spills, create a nationwide system to clean up such accidents and establish a $ 1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved and sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a bill providing $ 895 million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the drought and other weather-related problems

 Actor <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> passed out after videotaping two young women having sex in his hotel room, and the women took the tape and began circulating copies of it the next day, <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine reports. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> last week agreed to perform 20 hours of community service to avoid prosecution for allegedly seducing then 16-year-old <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. Her mother drew attention to the video of Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and the girl's friend, <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON>, when she filed suit in May against <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. The civil suit is pending. The movie star and Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> met at a downtown disco during the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Rolling Stone, in its Aug. 24 edition, quoted the dance club's publicity director, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, as saying Miss <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON> called her the morning after the tape was made to tell her about it Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON> told her that when <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> passed out, she and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> left the hotel room, taking $ 200 from his wallet, along with pills and the tape. The young women arranged through a friend at a hair salon where they worked to have someone make copies, the magazine said. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who is filming a movie called `` Bad Influence,'' declined to be interviewed for the article, and his publicists refused to comment. Rolling <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the videotape consists of three segments, starting with a sex escapade involving <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> and a male and a female friend in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> before he went to the convention. The second segment shows <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s visit to an <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> baseball game with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and the third shows the encounter with the two young women, which took place at a hotel on July 18, 1988.

 A group of adoptees, birth mothers and adoptive parents say their rally at the Lincoln Memorial is part of an effort to seek the unsealing of confidential birth records. The 40 participants concluded a 2 -LCB- - week march from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday and launched a two-day public awareness campaign that will include the rally today at the Lincoln Memorial The group picketed Friday in front of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> while five members went inside to request original birth certificates. The five, including two adoptees and three women who had given up children they bore in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> when they were teen-agers, were turned down by Registrar <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>. `` I have the old nothing answer, I guess, because it's the law,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, an adoptive father himself, told the group. `` The law says that when a person is adopted ... we create a new birth certificate and the old certificate is under seal and can only be opened by order of the court.'' Similar efforts to obtain birth records had failed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> earlier in the march. The president of another adoption group objected to the marchers' efforts to have records unsealed. `` People have a right to be left alone,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 141 adoption agencies and 2,000 individuals. `` The courts have said rather clearly that ... a person's right to privacy is greater than the right to the information.'' He pointed out that many birth mothers do n't want to be found, but <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> insisted adoptees would not abuse an open record system by disrupting the lives of birth mothers. `` If a birth mother does n't want to be found, all she has to say is, ` I do n't want a relationship''' when her child contacts her, said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he favors a mutual consent arrangement, in effect in 22 states, which allows birth mothers and their adult children to meet if both register to express that desire. He called mutual consent `` a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to get together if they both want to.'' `` If most of them do have a burning desire to meet, then most of them will voluntarily register,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. Ten states use a system that allows an adult adoptee to request a search for his or her mother and then meet her if she consents, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Three states _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ open records once an adoptee reaches age 18. The remainder of the states have sealed records.

 Zipping back and forth in front of the Capitol, the knee-high vehicle looked like a space age toy. But senators who celebrated the completion of the no-fuel, cross-country journey of the prototype solar-powered vehicle are taking <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>'s creation seriously. `` This really is the wave of the future,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., calling it `` one of the most exciting things we could witness. With bemused tourists looking on, three-wheeled vehicle was inspected on the Capitol lawn Friday by lawmakers who hope solar-driven cars can eventually replace gas-burning autos. Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., pondering the possibilities of pollution-free solar cars, said traditional automobiles produce their weight in carbon each year, emissions that add to air pollution and global warming The 3,200-mile trip from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> via the South was made in two weeks, setting a new world distance record for solar cars. <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, 22, the car's chief designer and one of four drivers, said his group is working on two solar powered cars _ an economy model that would sell for about $ 12,000 and a sports model for $ 20,000. They would look much more like traditional autos, he said. <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> hopes to have the cars in `` semi-mass production'' within two years. `` Our message is ... everyone can drive to work and back in a solar car,'' said <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, a 1989 graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> who built his first solar-powered car while in high school. The 270-pound `` Solectria'' has a single-seat cockpit styled like the inside of a racing car, with the driver's legs extending straight forward and a tiny steering wheel. An 11-foot by 6 -LCB- - foot rectangular solar panel sits flat atop the body, with a small bubble in the middle for the driver `` It's actually comfortable,'' said the 6-foot 4-inch <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, looking decidedly uncomfortable as he sat in the car. The vehicle is powered by a small electric motor that can get the car up to 90 mph. <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>'s prototype clearly has limitations _ he could not get the vehicle to get over a curb to get to the site of the news conference _ but it has responsive turning and fast pick up. The designer raced around the Capitol parking lot at speeds that ordinarily would bring a warning from security guards. <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, wearing a white racing jumpsuit and flashing a thumbs up sign, said the team had few troubles other than a couple of flats in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. But the traditional gas-powered truck that brought the solar car from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> broke down.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be making a mistake by following <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s lead and barring high school dropouts from driving, said the lawyer for the teen-ager who failed in his challenge of the state law. <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> upheld the law Friday, saying the government has a compelling interest in keeping children in class. The case involved an appeal filed by 17-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, who lost his license when he dropped out shortly after his 16th birthday. The law has drawn national attention, and on Thursday an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman introduced a bill for a similar nationwide statute. Means' lawyer, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON>, said that would be a mistake. <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> said inner-city youths often do n't have access to cars and wo n't care if their driver's licenses are taken away. `` White, suburban kids will go back to school so they can have the car on Saturday night and go cruising,'' he said. `` Kids in the inner-city are going to have no reason to stay in school because they can use the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> subway.'' Means, whose 16-year-old wife is expecting their first child this month, lives on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and says he ca n't get a job to support his family without driving privileges He overslept, <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> said, and did not attend Friday's hearing. Means does not have a home telephone and messages left with his family were n't returned. In his ruling, <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> said Means was not denied due process because he was granted a hearing by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> before his license was suspended. He also ruled that Means failed to prove he was forced to drop out of school by circumstances beyond his control, an exemption provided by the state law. Noting that 40 percent of the state's residents have an eighth-grade education or less, <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> said the law is a legitimate way for the state to persuade students to stay in school. `` The failure to graduate or complete a secondary education not only adversely affects the juvenile, it affects the society as a whole,'' <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> said. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who represented the state at Friday's hearing, said 400 dropouts whose licenses were suspended because of the new law returned to school last year. The state normally has 5,000 dropouts each school year, but in 1988-89 the number was just 3,400 to 3,500, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` This ruling establishes that driving is a conditional privilege and not a basic right,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Further, this law acts as a positive tool in building a solid foundation for a prosperous and more educated generation.''

<HEAD>Report: Statehood for Puerto Rico Could Raise Social Welfare Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> becomes a state, federal spending for some social welfare programs could rise, a congressional study says. The study, released Friday by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who requested it, looked at the effects of a proposal for a referendum on the status of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, currently before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Congressional Research Report analyzed what would happen to some social welfare programs if <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> were to become a state; be granted independence; or receive `` enhanced'' commonwealth status under which federal grant-in-aid programs could be consolidated and streamlined. For example, replacing <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s program of aid to the aged, blind or disabled with the <ORGANIZATION> Supplemental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> program would significantly expand the eligible population, increasing benefits by as much as tenfold, said the report. The study did n't make definitive cost or budget estimates but looked at the general implications of the alternatives. Demographically, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is younger, poorer and suffers higher unemployment than any of the 50 states, the study noted. The programs that would have the greatest impact if extended to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as a state are food stamps, Supplemental Security Income and the earned income tax credit, for which benefits are nationally uniform and not set by the states, the study found. Currently, SSI is not available in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The program, which is administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, guarantees a minimum level of cash income to the needy blind, aged and disabled. Instead, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> operates an assistance program of aid to such people, although disability payments are restricted to those age 18 or older. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government pays 75 percent of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s assistance payments to the aged, blind or disabled up to a specified limit, the report says. In fiscal 1987, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> qualified for a maximum of $ 12.9 million in matching funds, according to the study. But if <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> were treated like the states, <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> would replace the current system, providing much larger benefits but setting much higher eligibility limits, the report says. Furthermore, SSI would cover disabled children not currently included. If <PERSON> Puerto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> became a state, the federal food stamp program would replace its Nutrition Assistance Program, under which eligible people receive cash benefits. All benefits would have to be issued in coupons, and while it is not clear what the levels would be, they would be higher than in the rest of the country, according to the report.

<HEAD>Administration Supports Farm Disaster Assistance Package</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is embracing a nearly $ 900 million package of federal disaster aid for farmers passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover crop losses this year from severe weather. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> indicated Friday the president would sign the legislation and he vowed to implement the relief program `` as promptly and fairly as we possibly can.'' Passage of the measure by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ended weeks of uncertainty for farm-state lawmakers, who worried they would have to return home empty-handed for a month-long recess. Now they can assure farmers that federal relief checks will be available to cover expenses for the fall planting season. `` When our farmers suffer catastrophic loss, whether it's due to drought, flood or other disastrous weather, we must keep our pact with those who work the land,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure on a voice vote and forwarded it to the White House The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill earlier in the day without a recorded vote. In general, farmers can qualify for federal payments if they suffer crop losses from 35 percent to 50 percent because of weather-related disasters. The measure also offers payments to livestock producers facing drought-related feed and water shortages for their herds. Key eligibility and payment provisions in the assistance package are identical to legislation approved Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill is projected to cost about $ 895 million. `` It seems to me that the final outcome is about as sound as could have been expected under the circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The legislation is aimed primarily at farmers in portions of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and western Corn Belt, which have not recovered from the drought of 1988, and in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where flooding has destroyed rice and cotton. The bill has different eligibility standards for various crops but in all cases, producers would receive payments designed to cover 65 percent of their lost income from crop losses. In most instances, the projected income levels will be based on federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have received had they not suffered losses. Lawmakers intend to pay for the relief package with savings from commodity subsidy programs, which are costing less because of higher market prices this year from weather-shrunken harvests. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 3.9 billion in assistance for farmers hurt by drought. Supporters of this year's legislation said continued severe weather required another relief package but they pledged to improve the federal crop insurance program to alleviate the need for agricultural disaster aid in the future.

 Responding to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has passed environmental-protection legislation hailed by Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> as reducing `` the potential for damage to our nation.'' The measure boosts companies' liability for oil spills, creates a nationwide system to clean them up and establishes a $ 1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages. Similar legislation is pending in the House. Such legislation had been under consideration for years, but the issue took on a new sense of urgency after the tanker struck <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, rupturing the ship's hull and spilling 11 million gallons of oil that stained the coastline. Added impetus came from two smaller-scale spills over a 24-hour period off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. `` The purpose of this bill is to make sure that we never again allow an oil spill to become an ecological disaster,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., the bill's floor manager `` This legislation, when enacted into law, will discourage such oil spills in the future and reduce the potential for damage to our nation,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who worked for passage of oil-spill legislation for eight years. `` And if they do occur, they will be cleaned up and compensated much more readily than has been the case,'' he said. The bill was approved 99-0, with Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., not voting The legislation directs that contingency plans be drawn for dealing with oil spills on land and water and requires the establishment of cleanup teams with pre-placed equipment. The $ 1 billion trust fund will be financed by a 3-cent-a-barrel fee _ or tax _ on all domestic and imported petroleum. The bill provides for increasing the limit of compensation for each oil spill from $ 500 million to $ 1 billion. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> praised the action. `` This bill is a major step forward for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and all other coastal states whose residents face enormous economic, environmental and human damage from oil spills,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said in Fairbanks. `` This bill wo n't end the suffering, but it will make major spills less likely and the response to them quicker and better.'' In acting on a series of amendments, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sharply raised an owner's liability for compensating for oil spills and their destruction of property and the environment. The legislation preserves the authority of the states to impose unlimited liability if they wish and to impose their own oil spill standards and requirements, set up cleanup or compensation funds and levy fees and penalties. It also gives the president extensive authority to take overall charge of cleanup efforts, including issuing orders to owners.

 Education Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and two veteran politicians from the ruling party today applied to run in next week's election to choose the third prime minister in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> this year. Scandals involving bribery and sex have forced <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, from office prematurely. While the 58-year-old <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> remains the front-runner, some party leaders complained that he had been selected in backroom factional manuevers. Offended by those wanting reform pledges, two party veterans announced at the last minute Friday that they would challenge <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>. All three put in nomination papers shortly before the deadline this morning at the headquarters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a secret ballot Tuesday to elect a successor to Prime Minister Uno. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> took office June 2, replacing <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned as an influence-peddling scandal sent the party's popularity skidding to record lows in opinion polls. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> became the target of allegations he kept paid mistresses, and he decided to step down after the party lost in July voting for half the seats in the upper house of Parliament. The other candidates are <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, 62, a former welfare minister, and ex-Transportation Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, 56, who comes from the strongly nationalist wing of the party. Whoever is elected to head the party is assured the prime ministership because of its majority in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, known as an eloquent speaker, pledged to promote political reforms to restore public trust in the scandal-plagued party. In a statement formally announcing his candidacy today, he also stressed the continuation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s close ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and development aid to third world countries. `` In order to protect the peace of our nation and the world, I will maintain the Japan-U.S. security system and continue our efforts to defend our own country by our own hands,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said. Though his career as a 10-term member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> qualifies him as a contender for prime minister in the eyes of many party members, he has not served in top Cabinet or party posts, and his faction in the party is one of the smallest, giving him little political power. On Friday, the large faction led by former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> decided to support <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, who also belongs to one of the smallest groups in the party. <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohta </PERSON>, a leading member of the <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> faction, called for an open selection process for the next leader and criticized <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s candidacy as a product of factional maneuvering. The ruling party is a collection of a half-dozen major factions that are differentiated more by personal and financial allegiances than by policy or ideology. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, a prominent author known for his conservative, often nationalist views, is supported by some young members of the party across factional lines. He said Friday, `` Politics do not exist for politicians, but for the country. If we leave the situation as it is now, factionalism and power politics will continue to prevail.'' Analysts said <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> remained the leading candidate because of strong backing from factions led by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, two of the most powerful members of the party. The party's 405 lawmakers and 47 representatives from local chapters will vote in a secret ballot Tuesday to chose its new president. The party plans to have the winner elected as the new prime minister in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. A new cabinet is expected to be announced by late Wednesday. The Liberal Democrats have been seeking a strong leader who can restore public trust in the scandal-ridden party. The party's popular No. 2 official, <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, 52, had been regarded as a potential contender, but he formally declined to run Friday, saying his candidacy would have created a further split in the party. Party officials said the new leader will serve only until the end of October when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s original term expires. The party then will hold a new election, they said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has suspended two mechanics who are suspected of having accidentally left wheel chocks in both wing wheel wells of a jet that was forced to make an emergency landing in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The mechanics, whose names were not released, were suspended without pay pending an investigation by the airline of the incident, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He estimated the airline's investigation would take four days and said, `` Until that time, the full disciplinary actions will not be determined.'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> owns <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> and was scheduled to merge the carrier into <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> today. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, with 100 people aboard left <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> bound for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday with a stop in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. It was diverted to <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> when the crew could n't get the landing gear down. No one was injured in the emergency landing. Triangular rubber blocks about called wheel chocks, about 2 -LCB- feet on a side, are used to keep the plane from rolling while it is on the ground. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday a 2 -LCB- - foot wheel chock had been found in the left wheel well immediately after the landing and investigators found evidence _ bent hydraulic lines _ that a chock in the right well was thrown out during maneuvers to shake the gear loose The two mechanics were assigned to check the plane Tuesday night, and during that check, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, director of the safety board's regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the aircraft was moved six times. The chocks were apparently placed in the wells during one of those moves, he said. Ground crews sometimes stuff the chocks in the wheel well while moving planes, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, a practice he called `` not a normal procedure.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said routine preflight inspection should have included checking the wheel compartments. Pilot <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> told investigators he delegated the walk-around inspection to First Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> before takeoff. Fuda landed the jet on its right main gear, then touched the nose wheel down before settling the plane onto its left engine and skidding to a halt on the 10,000-foot runway, a shower of sparks coming from the scraping metal. Only the left engine, suspended below the wing, was damaged and the plane is expected to be returned to service after repairs.

<HEAD>Bush Voices Support for Nicaraguan Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with leaders of the Nicaraguan Contras to reinforce his support for their cause on the eve of today's meeting of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents to discuss disbanding the rebel force. Contra commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, Contra directorate member <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and other leaders told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the 20-minute meeting Friday that any demobilization must be tied to democratic reforms by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. `` They said if worse comes to worse, they're prepared to continue their struggle,'' said one administration official with knowledge of the meeting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` he had supported them in the past and would continue to do so in the future,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the rebels he was urging the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents `` to preserve the integrity of the resistance'' until the Nicaraguan elections in February. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said that could mean the forces will remain encamped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> or move into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under conditions negotiated with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The White House meeting came as Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced the domestic political opposition had agreed the Contras should disband. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he will insist at the presidents' summit that camps housing 12,000 Contras in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> be emptied. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the rebels support the principles laid out in the <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreement announced in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, but only if democratic reforms come first. The Central American presidents meet this weekend to work on specifics of their earlier agreement that the rebel army should be disbanded in return for reform in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants clear signs of democratic change before the Contras have to disband. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have sidestepped the question of whether that means they want to keep the Contras together as a fighting force until the elections. `` You can argue over timing, but the answer is ... we feel that we should not be disintegrating the Contras until there's some assurance that the Sandinistas are meeting their democratic commitments,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Friday. Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vote of confidence, <ORGANIZATION> Matamoros </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels were upset with efforts from `` certain sectors in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'' to divide the Contras, to speed demobilization. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> this week, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of breaking an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by urging the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents not to disband the Contras until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Feb. 25 elections are concluded He warned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could off the $ 40 million aid package agreed to in a bipartisan accord between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats. The aid package is to keep the Contras supplied with non-lethal materials, but also can be used for voluntary relocation of rebels into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Prepaid Tuition Plan Could Ease Parents' Worries Over College Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like a lot of 5-year-olds, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> dreams of being many things when she grows up. Like a lot of parents, her father is already worried about paying for her education. `` She wants to be a fireman, she wants to be a nurse, she wants to be a doctor,'' said <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. With the introduction of the first national prepaid tuition program, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and other parents would have the option of paying now for their childrens' education _ a hedge against the rising costs of college. Under the National Prepaid Tuition Plan, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> could be signed up for four years at a college before she can even pronounce its name. `` If I can have the opportunity of locking in the cost now without having to worry about the rate of return in future years, that would certainly be one of my considerations,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he works as a high-yield bond analyst. Universities such as <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> have expressed interest in the plan, proposed by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> Paul-based <ORGANIZATION> HEMAR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but many others doubt whether it will ever get off the ground. Parents would pay a lump sum into independent investment funds selected by colleges with the help of <ORGANIZATION> HEMAR </ORGANIZATION>, which would charge 1 percent annually from the interest on the accounts. This would guarantee a four-year education, as long as the student was admitted to the college. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said he wondered whether highly competitive schools with tight admissions policies would ever partake in the plan. <ORGANIZATION> HEMAR </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said he hoped the plan would be available this fall or winter pending rulings from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>, a former bank official and assistant director of financial aid at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he envisions at least half of the nation's colleges, including top schools, signing up within five years. His company, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a student loan insurer, mailed announcements about the plan last month to 1,350 schools. `` It gives them a recruiting device they did n't have before. Now they're in a position to recruit students at the age of birth if they're particularly aggressive,'' said <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said the plan was flexible in allowing students to select schools other than the ones invested in by their parents. Such investments could be transferred in some cases, although parents would receive only their original investment back _ without interest _ if their children decided not to go to college, or selected schools not included in the plan. `` We worked pretty hard to make sure this plan had value to colleges as well as consumers,'' <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tuition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, is introducing its own prepaid tuition plan, set up as a taxable mutual fund, to 30 colleges' alumni and supporters this month. Some experts have reservations about prepaid tuition, saying it would be extremely risky for colleges to participate in the plan. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON>, a policy consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an association of about 1,400 colleges and universities, said it could mean that taxpayers or other students would have to pay if the invested prepayments do n't keep pace with rising tuition costs. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said a school that had n't done well in investing the prepayments might be tempted not to accept some of the children as students, because prepayment is no guarantee of admission. `` I really do think this tension between the admission office and the business office could become very problematic, where the economies of the plan may dictate who gets admitted to school,'' <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said. State-sponsored prepaid tuition programs exist already in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> pioneered a plan four years ago allowing alumni parents to pay a lump sum guaranteeing four years of college assuming the child was accepted for admission. But <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> suspended the plan last year because of higher-than-expected tuition increases and lower-than-anticipated earnings on investments that rendered it uneconomical.

 Federal courts get bogged down interpreting unclear laws, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is moving toward returning to a method of interpretation that would force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to legislate more carefully, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` It is a truism to say that over the years <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has come to be the primary source of change in federal law ... the upshot has been that much more of the work of the federal courts has involved the interpretation and application of statutory law,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said in a speech Friday night before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention. In the past 50 years, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, courts have determined congressional intent of a law based not only on the statute itself, but on it's `` legislative history,'' including committee hearings and reports, debates on the floor and conference committee actions. The courts follow the statutory language if it clearly relects legislative intent, he said, but many cases involve `` ambiguous language, and in these cases resort to legislative history has been the usual course,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` This is often a very large undertaking, taking hours and hours of effort by judges, law clerks, and librarians, to say nothing of the time lawyers spend and charge for seeking to present the materials that the judiciary has indicated are relevant to decision.'' With the increasing complexity of subject matter, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> is advocating a return to interpreting statutes based mainly on the legislation's text, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The debate over how statutes should be interpreted `` is extremely important since it involves how the courts may best carry out the will of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Sometimes, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is vague on purpose, to force court decisions.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent a landmark savings and loan bailout to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> early today after a frantic two days of wrangling over the finishing touches on the biggest financial rescue in history. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the $ 159 billion legislation shortly after midnight Friday on a 201-175 vote, allowing weary members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to begin a monthlong vacation that had been threatened by a bitter fight with the administration over the financing of the package. House Democrats abandoned the bill in large numbers after key congressional negotiators bowed to a veto threat by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and agreed to hide 60 percent of the bailout's cost from the federal deficit. But with the losses of government-insured deposits mounting at a rate of $ 20 million to $ 30 million daily, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders from both parties _ with vigorous personal lobbying by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the telephone _ put together enough votes to replenish an insolvent S & amp; L insurance fund with $ 50 billion. `` The savings of million of Americans are at stake unless we do something,'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, R-Mo., said just before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill on a non-roll call late Thursday night Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the nation risked `` another bank holiday'' similar to the wave of bank closings of 1933 when depositors lined up for blocks demanding their savings, turning what was then a recession into the Great Depression. The $ 50 billion will be used over the next three years to close and merge 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls and pay off depositors whose savings were lost to failed and often fraudulent loans over the past decade, most of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The legislation also overhauls the regulation of the industry, requiring owners of the nation's 3,000 thrift institutions to put up billions of dollars more of their own money as capital to serve as a buffer between risky loans and federal deposit insurance funds. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration had worked out the reforms weeks ago, leaving the sticky issue of how to pay for the bailout without raising taxes or dipping into other government programs as the major roadblock to fixing the S & amp; L crisis. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted that the money be raised through an elaborate scheme using non-Treasury bonds to be issued by a new government agency created only for that purpose as a way of keeping the bailout costs out of the government's official deficit figures. Democrats demanded that the money be borrowed directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, a move that would have swelled the deficit by $ 44 billion over three years but would have reduced the 30-year interest costs on the borrowing by $ 4.5 billion. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday threatened to veto the bill if it ballooned the deficit, the two sides agreed to split the financing both ways. Under an accord hammered out by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> with key lawmakers, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will borrow $ 20 billion before October, swelling the estimated deficit for this year from $ 148 billion to $ 168 billion. But the non-Treasury bonds will be used to raise the other $ 30 billion in 1990 and 1991, raising the deficit a maximum of only $ 3.5 billion _ the annual interest payments on the borrowing _ each of those years if current interest rates prevail. Just before the vote today, Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, one of 135 House Democrats voting against the bill, complained his colleagues had lost their conscience and their backbone in response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto threat. `` It should have been paid for by taxes, but the president could not bring himself to say the word,'' said <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>. `` So we have fostered this unconscionable debt on our children and grandchildren.'' By the administration's latest estimates, the bailout is expected to cost $ 159 billion _ including interest on the borrowing to pay for it _ over the next 10 years. Over 30 years, the costs mushroom to $ 285 billion, of which taxpayers will pay at least $ 157 billion, according to the congressional auditors in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The bill also requires S & amp; Ls to channel more of their lending to home mortgages and away from speculative commercial real estate ventures and high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. It gives the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> $ 75 million a year to root out fraud at financial institutions and establishes a new agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to dispose of $ 300 billion of real estate and other property falling into the government's hands through failed S & amp; L loans. For the first time, banks will be able to buy and own healthy S & amp; Ls, their biggest lending market competitor in many communities. And the thrift industry will be required to pour $ 50 million to $ 100 million of its profits each year into subsidizing mortgages at below-market interest rates for low-income families.

<TEXT>
 The source of future paychecks is uncertain, but musicians of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> believe the show must go on. `` You've got to think optimistically,'' trumpet player <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. `` Not being paid is a big thing. But it takes a lot to get here, and it would n't be the first time I did n't get paid.'' The orchestra, regarded as one of the nation's top 10, is verging on collapse with an $ 8 million deficit. If not for a recent $ 1 million state appropriation, the symphony already would have closed. Without $ 18 million in donations, bankruptcy court is the next step for the 75-year-old orchestra, Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. As an executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> helped guide the No. 3 automaker out of a financial abyss a decade ago and hopes to reprise that success with the symphony, which he took over last year. The musicians believe <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> needs a symphony to help offset a national reputation of being ridden with drugs and crime. `` A good orchestra would provide better public relations for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> than any car this city could produce,'' said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollman </PERSON>, a viola player in the orchestra since 1973. `` If a city has any intellectual activity, it has to have a symphony. `` If you do n't have appreciation for arts, then you do n't have much.'' That appreciation has been lacking, and symphony management concedes it has n't been nurtured. `` The graying of American audiences is one of the crucial problems that all orchestras face,'' orchestra Executive Director <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Borda </PERSON> said. `` If you go to one of our concerts, you see the average age of the audience is in the late 50s and early 60s.'' Attendance has lagged at a little more than 50 percent, for the orchestra has failed not only to draw younger concertgoers, but also minority patrons. The city's population, some 1 million, is about two-thirds black. `` The orchestra had not listened seriously to a number of concerns that were raised by the community about it being a part of the community,'' <PERSON> Borda </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't live in a community and be totally divorced from it.'' The symphony has hired a black bass player, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, but without going through the normal blind audition procedure, in which those choosing among the finalists for a position ca n't see the candidates. That drew criticism from many musicians who, while praising <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s ability, think his hiring without an audition could compromise the symphony's artistic reputation and keep qualified musicians from trying out. <PERSON> Borda </PERSON> said the orchestra's decision to hire <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> `` has had a profound effect in the symphony industry. It has made people question themselves about what does the symphony orchestra need to do to be more inclusive, while not lowering their standards.'' As for the financial problems, the musicians blame previous management. Fund-raising also was hurt when Music Director <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON> announced he would move to the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> after next season. The Detroit Symphony is one of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> symphonies to run at a deficit. The <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>, considered among the most financially secure, reported a $ 1.5 million loss last season, its largest ever. Orchestras in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> recently resumed operations after closing temporarily because of money woes. And the financially plagued <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> started to make plans for this season thanks to a survival plan approved Friday that includes shortening the season by half and cutting musicians' salaries. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Borda </PERSON> have a five-year plan to eliminate the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> orchestra's debt by 1993. The plan seeks to control costs, attract urban professionals and blacks, increase the orchestra's endowment and name a replacement for <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON> by March. The orchestra also is moving from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> downtown to the acoustically superior Orchestra Hall. The new programs already have shown signs of success. Subscriptions are running 20 percent ahead of those during the past five years, <PERSON> Borda </PERSON> said. `` There has been so much bad news about the symphony for so long that that general atmosphere makes it tougher to raise money,'' <PERSON> Borda </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>USDA Announces $9.5 Million in Payments to Apple Growers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has announced details of $ 9.5 million in payments to apple growers under a program to combat surpluses arising from concern over use of the chemical Alar. Under the plan, 57.5 million pounds of fresh apples will be diverted by 56 growers in six states to an array of organizations requesting them, including manufacturers of ethanol and livestock feed, the department said Friday. The plan is designed to divert the apples from normal trade channels and thus, without disrupting the market, reduce a huge surplus that piled up during the first half of the year after an environmental group charged that Alar posed an unacceptably high risk of cancer. Governmental officials say that apples are safe to eat and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is taking steps to ban the use of Alar, which is sprayed on fruit to enhance red color, extend storage life and make harvesting easier. The payments were awarded to bidders under a $ 15 million overall program to aid the industry that was announced July 25 by the department. it said growers participating are located in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 The five miners who prospector-cannibal <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> fed upon in the winter of 1874 were viciously beaten to death and their bones picked clean of flesh with knives, researchers say `` The pangs of starvation can not adequately and totally account for the brutality manifested in these killings,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, a professor of law and forensic science at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we have seen is not merely murder but butchery, a butchery at once wholesale, remorseless, unremitting and deliberate,'' he said at a news conference Friday. <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> organized a scientific inquiry that last month unearthed the bones of the five men in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of southwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The expedition was launched to solve one of the grisly mysteries of the Old West, the story of <LOCATION> Packer </LOCATION> _ a harness maker, guide and prospector from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> _ and the men he ate. A team of 13 scientists and anthropologists using radar-mapping equipment recovered the remains two miles south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> and five other gold-seekers became snowbound on a 9,000-foot-high pass in February 1874 <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> walked out of the mountains the following April. In his confession, he admitted having eaten the others to survive, but said he had shot one of the men, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, in self-defense when he returned to camp and found <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had murdered the other four with a hatchet. `` There is no visible evidence for gunshot wounds on any of them,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and curator of physical anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist, initially had said last month there appeared to be a bullet hole in one pelvic bone. But he said laboratory examination showed it to be a hole caused by the canine tooth of a flesh-eating animal. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said the youngest victim, believed to be 17 or 19, was beaten the most severely. `` He was hit at least 11 times in the head with an axe.'' The young man's shattered upper left arm suggested that he had been able for a time to fend off his attacker. The victim would have been in better shape, stronger and perhaps better able to withstand the rigors of starvation and temperature than his older co-victims, the oldest of whom was between 50 and 60, <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said: `` Someone had an insatiable hunger. Whether for human flesh or not I am not about to say. This was not mindless cannibalism in any sense. These bodies were denuded of their flesh in a concerted and calculated way.'' <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> escaped from custody but was captured in 1883 in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and was convicted of murdering one prospector and sentenced to hang. The sentence was overturned on a technicality and on retrial he was convicted of manslaughter and given a 40-year prison sentence. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> died in April 1907, six years after he was paroled. <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said the bones will be reinterred Aug. 14 at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A previously unknown group claimed in a statement published today that a man killed in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel explosion was preparing an attack on British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since Feb. 14, when the late Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said his novel `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam and called on Moslems to kill the author. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said a man was killed Thursday as he worked with a handmade explosive charge inside a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel near <LOCATION> Paddington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. The statement from a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> did not identify the man, which it said was the group's `` first martyr.'' `` Others would follow his example to try to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>,'' said the statement published in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, An-Nahar. `` Henceforth, we warn all those who supported and facilitated <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s works and helped publish the satanic book to back off because our hand will reach out for them all,'' the group said. The statement called on British authorities to preserve the dead man's body, saying it would make arrangements to recover it later. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> said police were discounting claims that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was the intended target of the bomb. The dead man, the only victim of the Thursday blast at the 18-room <ORGANIZATION> Beverley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Hotel, had been staying there for several days, police said. He was believed to have a French passport and be of Moroccan background, according to hotel records, although his passport had not been recovered, said a representative of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's press office, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The dead man's surname was given as <PERSON> Mazeh </PERSON>, he said, but there was no first name yet.

<TEXT>
 A judge ruled the Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> will have to wait until at least next week to take possession of four sixth-century mosaics as attorneys for an art dealer fought to keep the artworks in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> said Friday he would decide Tuesday when the Cypriots could take possession of the mosaics, which remain locked in an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> vault. The delay was in response to a motion filed by the Cypriots seeking immediate possession of the artworks. <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> ruled Thursday that <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> must return the mosaics, which were stolen from a Greek Orthodox church in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> about 10 years ago. Attorneys for Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, meanwhile, filed a motion Friday to keep the mosaics in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> pending a possible appeal. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, an attorney for Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, said that if the Cypriots were allowed to take the mosaics out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> there would be `` grave difficulties'' in getting the artworks back. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, an attorney for the Cypriots, said his clients were determined to reclaim the mosaics `` as soon as possible.'' A local Greek Orthodox priest had stood by Friday to bless the mosaics. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, senior counsel for the Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said an icon which belongs to a church can only be removed after a blessing is given by a priest. `` The same procedure is followed when you want to take it back,'' <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> hailed the court decision Friday as opening the way for the recovery of stolen archaeological treasures worldwide. `` This encourages us to seek the recovery of other looted treasures because it will discourage international art merchants who deal in such stolen property,'' he said. In his 86-page ruling Thursday, <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> never obtained title to the mosaics, which she bought for $ 1.1 million last summer in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> had the mosaics restored last year at an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> museum. The mosaics, which date to 530 A.D., depict <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a young boy, the apostles <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and an archangel. They were originally part of a larger mosaic on the ceiling of the Church of the <LOCATION> Panagia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kanakaria </LOCATION>. The Cypriots learned the whereabouts of the mosaics in January, when Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> offered them to the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> <PERSON> Museum </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for $ 20 million. The Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Autocephalous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> sued Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and her art dealership, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and Feldman Fine Arts of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, in March to recover the mosaics. The trial began May 30 and lasted six days.

The hottest topic of conversation at the conference is the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, a black <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> priest who has formed a separate church that combines Catholicism with African and black American religious traditions. Of <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> would say only that he is `` praying for everybody involved'' and is leaving the priest's fate up to local church authorities. The church has suspended him from performing sanctioned Masses and other sacraments but has not moved to excommunicate him. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> implored black Catholics not to let racial questions force them from the church. `` The church can not be exclusive, whether it's exclusively white, exclusively black, exclusively yellow,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` We are all one in the body of Christ.'' The conference, whose theme is `` Creating a Spirit of African-American Leadership,'' centers on ways to eliminate racism in the church and bring more blacks into top church positions. Archbishop <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the first black archbishop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said he was saddened at the schism highlighted by <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' break, but he pointed to himself as evidence that blacks can attain power within the hierarchy. `` The majority of us intend to stay in the church and bring about change, and a lessening of racism,'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said. Still, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> might accomplish some good with his boldness. `` I think it has shown the leadership of the church that there are these concerns,'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said. A spokeswoman at <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' church, the <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the priest had no plans to attend the conference, held by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The groups represent more than 1 million black Catholics. One speaker during the conference, <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conwill </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> could boost black efforts to improve their standing in the church. `` We may not agree with his method of leaving the church but he is a catalyst,'' <PERSON> Conwill </PERSON> said. In his speech, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> stressed that leaders of black Catholics or of any other ethnic group must not try to teach their own version of Christianity. `` There are some people ... campaigning for all sorts of things who will promise you a pie in the sky,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` But are they leading where God wants people to be led?'' The cardinal said church leadership could do more to expunge racism from its congregations. `` The church leadership must make racism a priority,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` We must get rid of racism in the hearts of Catholics.''

 National anti-drug director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is targeting drug users to get them to quit, and he says he'll use arrests, fines and public embarrassment. A draft of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s national drug strategy, obtained Friday, says he wants drug users to lose their driver's licenses, their cars, their federal grants. And he wants them to get treatment, even if they do n't want it, saying, `` It is time to reexamine the premise that voluntary drug treatment should continue to be the mainstay of our treatment system.'' The strategy calls on states to `` consider expanding the use of ` civil commitment,' whereby addicts are sent by the courts to residential treatment facilities. Upon their release, they are required to participate in carefully monitored outpatient programs.'' The judicial procedures required in many states for such involuntary commitment `` are exceedingly cumbersome,'' and the draft says the federal government will propose a model state commitment law. The plan includes what <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> referred to last week as `` carrots and sticks.'' If states want full federal highway funds, they must adopt policies to revoke the drivers' licenses of people convicted of a drug offense, the strategy says. If states want federal criminal justice funds, they must adopt drug-testing programs for all arrests, prisoners, parolees, those out on bail and throughout their criminal justice systems. If schools, colleges and universities want federal money, they must implement firm prevention programs, according to the strategy. The strategy seeks a 49 percent increase in federal treatment money for 1990, from the current $ 621 million to $ 925 million. `` In 1987, about 834,000 individuals received some form of drug treatment, or one out of every seven people with a serious drug problem,'' the strategy says. `` There is little doubt that if we continue to treat only one in seven heavy drug users, treatment will not make a very large dent in the nation's drug problem.'' The objectives outlined in the strategy seek 10 percent reductions in drug use in two years and 50 percent decreases within a decade. The plan would set up similar reduction targets for supply, as represented by estimates of illicit drugs coming into the country and estimates derived from reports of the ease of obtaining drugs. The Domestic Policy Council held its first meeting on the draft Friday, and an administration source said the `` situation is fluid,'' with the strategy to undergo revisions before it is sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 5. While the strategy does not indicate the total spending proposed for law enforcement efforts in 1990, it calls for $ 1.2 billion for new prisons, expansion of federal prison capacity by 85 percent and increases in most law enforcement efforts. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also had sought $ 1.2 billion for prisons in his May crime proposals. One of the main focuses of the strategy is the use of crack, a crystallized form of cocaine, in the inner cities. `` It is an acid that is fast corroding the hopes and possibilities of an entire generation of disadvantaged young people,'' the strategy says. `` They need help. Their neighborhoods need help.'' The plan proposes a $ 200 million increase, for a total of $ 350 million, in aid for state and local authorities for street-level law enforcement. It also asks $ 50 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, $ 45 million of which would be used for security improvements at public housing projects. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> currently gets $ 8 million for such security work. The plan's proposals include:

 _ Subjecting users to fines, community service and having their names published in the newspaper and prison substitutes _ Asking states to enact `` user accountability'' laws that would include such penalties from drug possession as suspension of driver's license for one to five years, loss of student loans and fines _ Ensuring a drug-free federal workforce _ Promoting drug-free workplace policies in the private sector and in state and local governments, including clear penalties for use, with drug testing where appropriate

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has banned two Soviet publications because they allegedly promote anarchy and are fascinated with the bourgeois American way of life, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state news agency reported today.

<TEXT>
 The premieres of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new prime-time news shows resulted in mixed reviews but relatively good ratings. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' made its bow Wednesday to negative reviews for its cheesy special effects, dull stories and use of re-creations to illustrate some of its stories. But the reviews did n't deter viewers. Twenty-two percent of the viewing audience opted for `` <ORGANIZATION> YTT </ORGANIZATION>,'' putting it several points ahead of reruns on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` Wiseguy'' -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'' -RRB-. It did as well or better than the parade of entertainment shows <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has tried in the time period, which no one network has dominated. `` Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' is getting a three-week summer tryout, but is n't on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fall schedule. The much more highly publicized debut of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` PrimeTime Live,'' pairing <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, got good-to-so-so notices. `` Prime-Time Live'' is a weekly series from here on out. Though it came in last in its time period in the Nielsens, `` PrimeTime Live'' was a dramatic improvement for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which has been unable to make any headway against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> powerhouse Thursday lineup with entertainment programming, such as `` HeartBeat.'' Most recently, low-rated `` Thursday Night Baseball'' was in the time period. `` PrimeTime Live'' drew 18 percent of the viewing audience. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> normally gets about an 11. A rerun of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` L.A. Law'' got 21, as did the movie on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Outback Bound.'' <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> TV critic <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shales </PERSON> praised `` PrimeTime Live,'' saying, `` Network television experienced a welcome electrical charge last night.'' He called the premiere `` one of the smoothest maiden voyages in television history.'' Other critics were less enthusiastic. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, writing for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> `` made a workmanlike team.'' He said, `` No potatoes will be knocked off their couches,'' but dubbed the premiere `` a respectable effort.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> called it `` a good college try, but not a must-see yet.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianculli </PERSON> was not impressed at all. `` This is a show,'' he said, `` that started out with more flash than substance and with more desperation than direction.'' The critics were pretty unanimous, though, in criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> program, which featured three co-anchors _ <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, recently acquired from <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>; and local <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> critic <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> started out his review, `` This is a re-creation,'' then constructed a fictional _ and unflattering _ account of what the three anchors might have been saying when watching the show: `` Scarborough: God, I'm a commanding figure. Notice how I speak deeply and earnestly, my granite chin thrust toward the camera just so, implying strength and authority. My eyes have never sparkled like this before. And I'm having such a good hair day, I can hardly stand it.'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, like other critics, was especially bothered by the network news program's use of re-creations, a device identified in recent months with syndicated news programs of questionable journalistic integrity. `` Do n't the news divisions realize they have enough of a credibility problem without shooting themselves in the knee this way?'' wondered <PERSON> Shales </PERSON>. As for the program itself, he said, `` If you called it journalism as entertainment, you'd be stretching both terms.'' Concluded <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> critic <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was not any good at putting together a newsmagazine show yesterday, it's not any better today. It would be foolish to assume they can do better tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Telephone Workers in 24 States Prepare For Possible Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Four regional phone companies faced possible strikes tonight pending negotiations with unions representing 226,000 telephone operators, linemen and other communication workers in 24 states. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> were holding separate talks with workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on the contracts that expire at midnight. The main differences were over health benefits; each of the four companies, trying to save on medical and insurance bills, were trying to get unionized employees to pay a larger percentage of their medical bills. The four phone groups are among the seven so-called Baby Bells that were created as a result of the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup. `` We're in what I would call tough negotiations; they're going to be negotiating quite heavily in trying to meet that deadline,'' said <PERSON> Vira </PERSON> <PERSON> Milirides </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Workers may stay on the job past the deadline if the issues are close to settlement, she said <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the company was hopeful about reaching agreement with the union, which represents 44,000 workers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and 6,000 in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, 90 percent of the non-management work force. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> together form <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milirides </PERSON> said the group wants employees to start paying a percentage of their health benefits, previously paid entirely by the company, and is offering wage increases of about 5 percent over three years, which the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> says is insufficient. Pay ranges from about $ 228 a week for some operators to $ 650 for skilled technicians, <PERSON> Milirides </PERSON> said. Similar issues were being debated on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, the telephone company for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, on Friday raised its offer on health insurance in talks with the two union locals representing 60,000 workers. But <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> Local 2222 in <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said he doubted the offer would avert a strike. `` It amounts to about $ 2 a week,'' he said. `` It's not a substantial increase. It's not something we can accept.'' He said many employees joined the telephone company because of its generous benefits. `` The membership is really 100 percent behind us on this one,'' <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON> said. `` Most employees could understand if the company was in some kind of a financial problem, but they've made record profits.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said hundreds of management personnel are ready to take temporary assignments to maintain service in the event of a strike, and he predicted that customers would barely notice, since most telephone operations are automated. But <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON> contended that customers would quickly see a decline in service if the unionized operators, service technicians, linemen and clerical workers walked off their jobs. Other down-to-the-wire contracts were taking place in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> was negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> on contracts for 64,000 workers in nine states, and in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, involving the more than 52,000 <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> employees in six <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will press for the disbanding of the Contra rebel force in talks with other Central American presidents, and he has the backing of opposition leaders at home. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s leftist Sandinista government and 20 opposition parties in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> signed an accord Friday calling for the U.S.-backed rebel force to be dismantled. The issue is expected to top the agenda when <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> today open three days of meetings in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. Contra leaders met Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who reiterated his support for their cause. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the rebels to remain organized until after general elections next year. In the accord signed Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> pledge to hold free and fair elections Feb. 25, without any restraints on campaigning or news censorship. They also promise to suspend the military draft from September until after the balloting to prevent it from interfering with electoral activity. The Sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaints by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in earlier elections, their movements constrained and their exposure to the public restricted by news censorship. `` Even though the opposition is not completely satisfied, the electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition wants,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 parties. `` The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the peace process at the summit.'' The summit of Central American presidents is a follow-up to a February meeting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. At that meeting, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> promised to hold democratic elections next year and the five presidents agreed to devise a plan for disbanding the Contra force. The 11,000 rebels and their families are living in Honduran base camps. They began retreating to the camps near the Nicaraguan border last year when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid ran out. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to continue giving the Contras non-military aid until the elections. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said it wants to see democratic change in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> before the Contras disband. It has not made clear if that means keeping the Contras together as a fighting force until the elections. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the rebels support the same principles laid out in the agreement. `` We are not opposed to the question of reintegrating ourselves into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under democratic conditions. But those conditions have to be negotiated,'' he said. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the rebels could stay in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> until all issues are resolved or return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under conditions negotiated with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> wants the Contras out as soon as possible. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> has said he will present a plan for their immediate demobilization at the summit. The presidents at the summit also are to discuss having <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers monitor the Honduras-El <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and Nicaragua-Honduras borders. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s new rightist president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, has said he wants to link Contra demobilization to ending the 9-year-old civil war with leftist rebels in his country. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is arming the rebels. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which describes its support for the Salvadoran rebels as moral and logistical, opposes linking the two issues. The Tela summit will be the fifth held under a peace plan that President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> drafted in August 1987 to negotiate an end to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civil war and leftist insurrections in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Despite the regional language of the accord, the focus has consistently remained on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Contras have been at war with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> since 1981, two years after a popular revolution toppled dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. An estimated 50,000 people have died in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s war while the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> conflict has claimed about 70,000 lives, most of them civilians. Nearly three generations of political violence in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> have claimed more than 100,000 lives, the vast majority of them civilians.

<HEAD>Death Toll From Quake Rises to 116</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rescue teams have found 19 more bodies, bringing to 116 the death toll from an earthquake that triggered landslides in the country's easternmost province, a government official said today. The Social Affairs Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said rescue workers retrieved the bodies Friday from under demolished houses and masses of earth in the village of <LOCATION> Soba </LOCATION>, in the mountainous district of <LOCATION> Kurima </LOCATION>. Soba was the hardest hit of three villages, including <LOCATION> Holuan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pasema </LOCATION>, nearest the quake's epicenter 219 miles south of the provincial city of <LOCATION> Jayapura </LOCATION>, 2,188 miles east of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. The official said workers also rescued 20 injured people who were trapped in the rubble of mountain slopes that were crumbled by Tuesday's quake, which measured 6 on the Richter scale. The scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph, and every increase on the scale means the motion is 10 times greater. A magnitued of 6 can cause severe damage. Authorities have evacuated more than 700 people from the stricken area, which has a population of about 3,500 people, the official said. `` Rescue workers still are busy searching for missing villagers,'' he said via telephone from <LOCATION> Jayapura </LOCATION>. He could not say how many remained missing, however. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> said an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 shook the southern coast of west Java on Friday, but that there were no reports of casualties or damages. He said the quake was centered in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. In 1981, more than 300 people were killed in <LOCATION> Kurima </LOCATION> by an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 Tornadoes touched down in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> early today, hours after thunderstorms rumbled across much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms in northeastern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> today spawned tornadoes around <LOCATION> Lemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, and produced high winds which downed trees and power lines around <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Friday night, heavy rains and severe winds ripped the roof off an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Bolingbrook </LOCATION>, and caused flooding that left patients at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital without water or hot food.

<HEAD>Weekend Brings More Bad Fire Weather to the West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Army soldiers set up camp on <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> fire lines today, just in time for dry, hot weather that had officials worried about lightning storms. Shifting winds pushed a brush fire away from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> observatory, which 500 firefighters had been rushed in to protect earlier Friday. Smaller forest, brush and grass fires burned in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. More than 21,000 people were at work fighting fires throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the nation's fire suppression headquarters. Almost 225,000 acres had been blackened or were burning since a rash of lightning storms in the middle of last week. The fire center has managed so far to get people and supplies where they are needed most, said spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON>. `` But if we get another bust -LRB- of lightning-caused fires -RRB-, things are going to be challenging.'' About 1,300 soldiers and support personnel from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, were arriving in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> today, said 8th Infantry Col. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Trifiletti </PERSON>. Another 1,300 soldiers from the 9th Infantry, based at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, began setting up camp Thursday in eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and on Friday about half of them began training on relatively safe fire lines before moving to more hazardous duty today. The other half of the contingent from the 9th Infantry, which served on the fire lines in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> last summer, was helping firefighters mop up after a fire at <LOCATION> Dooley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, that burned nearly 20,000 acres before being contained Thursday. Residents of the old mining town of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northeast of <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, crossed their fingers while waiting out the 4,244-acre Wangdoodle fire. `` They have retardant lines, handlines, dozer lines and hoselines in there to protect <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Felmy </PERSON> said. Still, the fire could `` hook around'' and make a run for the buildings in the event of erratic winds. The forecast was for a warmer weekend. `` We're in an increasing warming and drying trend,'' said <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Persing </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> forest. `` If we reach the weather we had several days ago, things could really start popping.'' Six major fires and at least four smaller fires in eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> had damaged about 82,000 acres of the timber and grazing land, killing cattle and chasing residents from their homes. Cool and moist weather this week has helped firefighters get the upper hand, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` But we're getting back to more normal weather now and that means firefighters are going to have to work extra hard,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said from a fire camp in the <ORGANIZATION> Malheur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, about 2,000 firefighters had contained 60 percent of a week-old blaze in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and officials could n't say when they might control the fire, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON>. The 11,000-acre conflagration 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> burned to within three miles of the historic <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest optical telescope, before shifting away, authorities said Friday. Astronomers at the observatory, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, were forced to cease their work and close the observatory to prevent ash from damaging the telescope's $ 20 million mirror. A fire in northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> had rushed through 4,000 acres of timbered canyon Friday and up to 30 people were evacuated, but it was declared contained after two South Dakota National Guard helicopters dumped fire retardant on hot spots. The fire was near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, which was ravaged a month ago by a blaze that charred 48,000 acres. Firefighters were close to containing a 60-acre brush fire near <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, this morning.

<HEAD>Oldest Shuttle Ready To Fly Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mission scientists began counting down today for the first flight of the space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in 3 -LCB- years, to release a military reconaissance satellite and a smaller scientific payload. The oldest space shuttle, last launched in 1986, has spent much of the past few years as a `` hangar queen,'' stripped like an old car to provide spare parts for its sister ships Discovery and Atlantis. Workers began in earnest last November to put <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> back together, under the direction of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, the first woman to manage the processing of a shuttle for launch. The countdown began at 12:01 a.m. with liftoff between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not be more specific, citing national security but not making it entirely clear why the secrecy is needed. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which first flew in 1981, last was launched on Jan. 12, 1986, its seventh flight. It returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Jan. 18, and 10 days later its sister ship Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing its crew of seven and grounding the remaining three shuttles. The post-accident investigation dictated more than 200 changes on each shuttle to improve safety and performance. With a shortage of manpower and new parts, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> decided that Discovery and <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>, newer than <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and more easily refitted, would have priority in the overhaul. For most of the time since then, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> languished in a hangar, with no engines, most of its protective skin torn away, no workers scrambling around on scaffolds. On Sept. 29, 1988, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronauts returned to space aboard Discovery. Atlantis followed in December, Discovery flew again in March and Atlantis again in May. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> several months ago set July 31 as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s launch date. Launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said he's pleased the agency is missing it by only a few days, considering all that had to be done. `` It will be a tremendous relief to get this one done,'' he said. Once in orbit, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s all-military crew reportedly will release a 10-ton reconnaissance satellite with high-resolution cameras, along with a much smaller scientific payload. This will be the fourth of 30 shuttle flights dedicated fully to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. As on the earlier ones, the Pentagon is mum about most details, including the length of the flight _ expected to be about four days. Defense officials would like to launch these military missions in complete secrecy, but, with thousands of people working on the shuttle, they know that would be very difficult. So the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> allows <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to announce a four-hour launch `` window'' _ from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, in this case _ and to make the countdown public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff.

 <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> disappeared today as the carrier joined with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> in one of the largest mergers in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation history. All over the <LOCATION> Charlotte-Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> logo was being replaced by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s red and blue colors Friday as officials gathered to bid farewell to the airline founded more than 40 years ago in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` The people of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> are justifiably proud,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USAIR </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` The only way we can prove we're as good is by doing a good job. As the midnight deadline approached, few vestiges of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> could be found at the airport that was the airline's major hub, with 300 departures a day. In early 1987, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth largest airline at the time, agreed to pay $ 1.6 billion in cash to acquire <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, the nation's ninth-largest carrier. On Friday afternoon, officials, city leaders and a few employees gathered at Gate 12B to say goodbye to the airline founded by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>. The union will create the country's seventh-largest airline with a fleet of 426 jets and 48,000 employees. The airline will operate in 36 states, two Canadian provinces, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` It was inevitable,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Neither of us wanted to merge; we both wanted internal growth. But one of us was going to be bought, and we wanted it to be compatible.''

 <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, the third-place finisher in May elections, was elected president of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> following an all-night debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, officials said today. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> garnered 98 of the 156 votes after former dictator Gen. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> cast his support to the 50-year-old. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, had been arrested by <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> in 1974 and accused of trying to overthrow the government. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjines </PERSON>, an ally of <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was elected vice president. Swearing-in ceremonies for the Bolivian leaders' four-year terms is scheduled for Sunday afternoon. The opposition had held up balloting because of alleged voting irregularities in the May 7 election. No candidate received a majority in the voting, so under <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s Constitution, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chose from the top three contenders. Squeezed out by the <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora-Banzer </PERSON> alliance was <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON> had received 24 percent of the vote in May while <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> from 1971-79, had 23 percent and <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> 18 percent. The alliance with <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of the votes to win the presidency with their two parties holding 79 of the congressional seats. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has had more than 100 coups or revolutions since it gained its independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1825 and Sunday's inaguration will be the first time in 25 years that a government has completed its term and transferred power to a democratically elected president. The alliance between <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s party and <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>'s conservative Nationalist Democratic Action could be an uneasy partnership <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> was jailed for six months after he was arrested in 1974 and accused of trying to overthrow <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>. Announcement of the alliance came as a surprise to many Bolivians and led to a run on banks. In two days depositers withdrew the equivalent of $ 13 million from the banks. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> met with business and banking officials Thursday and told them his government would maintain a free market economy and the current stabilization program. President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> implemented tough austerity measures when he took over in 1985. They included a restructuring of state companies, firing 23,000 government-employed miners, a ten-fold increase in the price of gasoline and a wage freeze. The measures lowered inflation from 24,000 percent in 1985 to an estimated 6 percent for 1989. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> is <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s uncle. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said Friday, `` We expect to have a very good relationship with this government and <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> has indicated to me his interest in attracting foreign investments to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> is the son of a career army officer. He attended a Roman Catholic seminary in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> but then went to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, where he was active in university politics. When he returned to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in 1971 he founded the Movement of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and advocated armed struggle to overthrow <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>, who seized power in a coup in 1971. After he was released, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> went into exile abroad. He came back to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in 1977 and resumed his political activities. In 1980, his party formed a coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Leftist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> under the leadership of <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON> and the coalition won the election.

 Syrian and Christian gunners blasted residential neighborhoods in vicious all-night shelling duels around the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area, killing 21 people and wounding 82, police said today. Ten of the victims died and 40 were wounded in the underground shelter of an apartment building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Fayadiyeh </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said. It was hit by a salvo of three 240-mm mortar rounds fired by Syrian gunners. The latest casualties raised the overall casualty toll to 537 killed and 2,266 wounded in a 20-week-old confrontation between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops and the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations, said the three mortar rounds pierced the parking lot of the 10-story apartment building and exploded in the underground shelter. `` Part of the building collapsed on the shelter, and victims were buried under the rubble,'' he said. Several ranking officers of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army live in <LOCATION> Fayadiyeh </LOCATION>, a wealthy suburb three miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The spokesman said soldiers evacuated most of the casualties in armored personnel carriers. `` It was very risky for ambulances to operate due to intensity of the barrage,'' he said. He said most of the casualties, although civilians, were taken to the military hospital in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The fighting started about 10 p.m. Friday, sending civilians to basements and underground shelters. The police spokesman said the barrage began as `` kind of the usual artillery exchange,'' with Syrian howitzer batteries targeting the Christian-controlled coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to blockade shipping and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners retaliating with attacks on Syrian emplacements in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said the Syrians `` escalated the exchange by deploying the 240mm mortars in the battle and targeting the shelter.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners and their right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia allies, the Lebanese Forces, entrenched in the Christian enclave `` responded heavily,'' the spokesman added. He said Christian militia gunners fired their Soviet-made multi-barrelled rocket launchers on residential districts in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, spitting out 40 rockets per minute. The Christians control a 28-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 130-mile <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Christian enclave, home for about 1 million people, has been besieged by Syrian and allied Moslem forces in retaliation for a blockade by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces of ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. An Arab League committee trying to mediate an end to the fighting said earlier this week it had reached an impasse and blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for blocking its 2-month-old mission. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 54, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, and other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders accuse the Syrians of betraying a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab League by supporting Moslems against Christians in the 14-year-old civil war. Moslems are seeking a greater share of political power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has been dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has comfortably survived a challenge by hard-liners in his <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement questioning his renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, a political adviser said today. `` There were some tense debates on political questions, brought about by the hard-liners,'' said <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaath </PERSON>, political adviser to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` But, in fact, this has become largely <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s congress.'' He was speaking outside the first congress held since 1980 by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main component of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the 1,000 delegates at the conference backed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and rejected the challenges to his leadership, <PERSON> Chaath </PERSON> said. The hard-liners `` have turned out to be less numerous and less noisy than some of the top <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> leaders had feared,'' he said. All substantive discussions of the congress have been held behind closed doors. The only journalists admitted are Palestinians who also are <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> delegates. On its first two days, the congress gave its full backing to the peace initiative adopted at <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s urging last November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chaath </PERSON> and other delegates said. Specifically, as reported by delegates and the Palestinian news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION>, the congress approved the council's proclamation of an independent Palestinian state, endorsed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, which guarantee the right of all states in the region to live within secure borders, and gave full support to the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising. In an impassioned speech before the congress Friday, his 60th birthday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> vigorously defended the peace plan and obtained <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>'s almost unanimous approval, delegates said. The main task of the congress, the fifth since the movement was founded in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1959, is to renew and enlarge membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is chairman. The panel has been reduced to 10 members by three assassinations and two departures of dissidents. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is to be enlarged to 20 or 21 members. Several hard-liners at Friday's sessions challenged the timeliness and effectiveness of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace moves, delegates said, and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader spoke repeatedly in the debate to defend his actions. <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the congress proved <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> has overcome its internal divisions and regained its unity following widespread defections in 1983. The congress has split into political, financial and organizational committees and is scheduled to close Monday, but delegates said it could well be extended for several days.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee can now begin interviewing witnesses and receiving documents as it proceeds with preliminary investigations of three lawmakers accused of sexual misbehavior. The committee on Friday announced preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., to determine if there's `` a reason to believe'' rules violations <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' press aide said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> congressman welcomed `` a full and open investigation.'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, who also has denied wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. If the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, as the panel is formally named, decides `` there is reason to believe'' a violation occurred in any of the cases, it could issue a statement of alleged violation, similar to an indictment. Later in the process, the committee could hold disciplinary hearings and eventually recommend punishment to the full House. The House Republican Conference, composed of all Republicans in the chamber, asked the ethics panel to investigate <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who was convicted in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a child. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who is appealing, was sentenced June 30 to 180 days in jail and fined $ 1,000 for having sex with a teen-age girl. The committee said the complaint alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' conduct violated a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule which states, `` A member, officer, or employee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> shall conduct himself at all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.'' <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' press aide, said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Republican `` has already said he welcomes a full and open investigation where his accusers' motives and the full record can be brought forth.'' He added that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> would be able to bring the committee information about the credibility of the teen-age girl and her mother, which was ruled inadmissible for the trial. Three House Democrats filed a complaint against <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> this month, after news accounts said a Peace Corps volunteer complained the lawmaker fondled her while he was traveling in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The ethics panel said it `` has been presented with complaints concerning the actions of Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> while that member traveled to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in connection with his official duties and responsibilities in March 1989.'' Since the incident, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspector general has sent investigators to collect information on <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s actions during official foreign travels, according to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member who would speak only as an unnamed source. News accounts this week said that when <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1986 as part of a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he revised his schedule and went to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for shopping and sightseeing. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> told reporters two weeks ago, `` I did nothing, that's what I did This lie was leaked by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for political reasons.'' The complaint against <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> was filed last year by two former aides, according to published reports. The committee said it `` has been presented with sworn complaints from two individuals against Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, alleging that they were sexually harassed by Rep. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> and that congressional staff and resources were used to perform campaign-related activities.'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said, `` I would deny they were sexually harassed and that the staff and resources were used to perform campaign-related activities _ at least under my direction.'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> added, `` I look forward to having the matter resolved. It has gone on for a year without any action. I would like it resolved. I do n't think it warrants a preliminary inquiry, but if the committee does, we'll cooperate in any way we can.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., disclosed Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has completed its preliminary inquiry of his previously revealed book publishing contract _ and voted to proceed with the investigation <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has been hired by the committee as special counsel to continue the probe, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, whose deal netted him $ 100,000 over two years, received income from a publisher who charged `` book promotion fees'' to groups that sought the senator as a speaker. A complaint from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lawyers who backed <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s 1988 re-election opponent, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, accused the senator of circumventing rules limiting speaking fees members can earn.

<HEAD>Britain Reports Fire on Nuclear Submarine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FASLANE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An electric motor in a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> nuclear submarine caught fire today while the vessel was berthed in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, but crewmen quickly extinguished the flames, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. No one was injured, and no radioactivity leaked out, <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The fire broke out shortly after midnight in an electric motor on the submarine HMS Valiant, a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. The vessel had returned to its base in Faslane on the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clyde </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> after a $ 88 million refitting. HMS Valiant, launched in 1963, is the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest nuclear-powered submarine. When on duty at sea, it is armed with surface-to-surface, conventional missiles and non-nuclear Tigerfish torpedoes. It carries a crew of 116. The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice, said the motor that caught fire is part of the hydraulic system. He said the fire posed no danger to the crew or the nuclear reactor. `` It was nothing to do with the nuclear side of things. It was a mechanical problem. It was nowhere near the reactor,'' he said. The hydraulic system drives some equipment on the submarine, including the periscope and hatches. The spokesman said he had no details of damage or exactly how the fire started. However, he said crewmen put it out within 15 minutes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are investigating an engineering officer in their Electronic Security Command for what a television network reported is suspicion of selling secrets to the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, a spokesman for the command in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Friday night that the officer, Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, has been restricted to <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, who was head of engineering and installation at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s electronic security wing at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Templehof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, was formally placed under investigation when he returned from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> earlier this week. Another command spokeswoman said the wing collects intelligence on East Bloc radar and communications. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> is suspected of selling secrets to the Eastern Bloc while he was stationed in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after September 1988. `` He is not under arrest and he has not been charged with anything,'' said <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, who would not confirm what the investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of Special Investigations concerns. `` There is an investigation that is ongoing,'' he said.. According to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> failed a lie detector test last week in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The network also reported the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> found uncashed paychecks, evidence of bank accounts totaling more than $ 120,000, photographs of Western military installations and other classified documents in his <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> also made several unexplained trips to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during the last three years, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> came under suspicion during the routine review of his security clearance. `` The investigation resulted from normal security procedures we employ to monitor security clearance,'' said <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>. Lt. <PERSON> Erlinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a public affairs officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the command works on communications and electronic combat capabilities, including ways the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> protects its radar from being jammed. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, 33, lists <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, as his permanent residence and has been with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> since 1979, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> is increasing security in its national parks and trying to reassure visitors following widespread publicity about the slaying of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> tourist in a game reserve. The increased security comes amid a clamor by politicians and the press over what they say is unfair treatment by the Western news media. `` It's War Against Slanted Reports,'' said a headline in Saturday's <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> newspaper owned by the country's only legal political party The accompanying story reported the outraged comments of more than half a dozen party leaders decrying news coverage of the murder of <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Typical was that of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamotho </PERSON>, secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, who said reports of the slaying were overblown and intended to scare off tourists. More than 700,000 visitors brought nearly $ 350 million into <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s economy last year, making tourism the country's biggest single source of hard currency. In an editorial Friday, the independent <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> said the American press had painted `` <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> as a benighted country of bloodthirsty and crime-prone people. `` Let us face it,'' the editorial continued, `` there is more crime in that metropolis called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> than there is in'' all of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, a country the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with a population of 22 million. A gang of armed men attacked Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s tour group July 28 on a dirt road between <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amboseli </LOCATION> national parks in southwestern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The killers, believed to have been poachers, have not been captured. It was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s national parks that began last September Gunmen have killed three visitors and seriously wounded three. Nonetheless, in ordering increased ground and aerial surveillance of the parks, Police Commissioner <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilonzo </PERSON> called Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s slaying `` an isolated incident.'' He said police, in consultation with tour operators, will provide armed escorts for tour groups in some of the country's largest and most popular parks <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION>, divided by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s main highway into two reserves, contains more than 8,000 square miles of land, much of it remote and nearly inaccessible. The attacks on tourists have coincided with a crackdown on ivory poachers, who have reduced <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephant population from 65,000 in the 1970s to about 17,000 today. Some observers have speculated that the poachers now have turned to robbing tourists.

<HEAD>Conferences to End Wars in Indochina: A History of Failure</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If history repeats itself, the latest international effort to end war in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> is doomed. Again and again, Western attempts to cobble together peace settlements for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> have proved abortive or short-lived. The clinking of champagne glasses in European salons soon was echoed by gunfire in faraway jungles and rice paddies. The latest such conference seeks a comprehensive peace package for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, a country torn apart by war, revolution and foreign invasion for the past two decades. Nineteen nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, are trying to establish a mechanism to monitor <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and reconcile the warring sides: a three-party guerrilla coalition headed by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, and the Hanoi-backed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which had turned the country into a murderous experiment in ultra-revolution. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are partners in <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s coalition and present a major threat to the complex peace process The past hangs heavily over the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference hall where the monthlong meeting is taking place. In opening speeches, several foreign ministers alluded to former failures: piecemeal, big-power arrangements that papered over stark differences and ignored realities. On Jan. 27, 1973, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> signed accords in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ground troops to pull out of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after leaving more than 50,000 dead on the battlefield. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> hailed the results of four years of negotiations between his secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> <PERSON> Tho </PERSON> as `` peace with honor.'' Reporters in some areas of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, however, could barely hear radio reports from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> about the cease-fire because of the fighting around them. Neither the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' ally, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, nor the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas of the south had been much consulted by the main protagonists. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was largely ignored. Two years later, communist forces swept into <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> began its reign of terror. Some historians trace the roots of the Indochinese tragedy to another <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference, which followed World War I in 1919. Gathering in the palace of <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, the victors sought a new global order but tended to ignore aspirations of peoples under colonial rule. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s future revolutionary leader, tried to argue his case for greater emancipation from French rule but was unceremoniously shown the door. The struggle for freedom was taken to secret communist cells. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after World War II, hoping to negotiate independence. The Vietnamese arrived at <LOCATION> Fontainebleau </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and finding few preparations for the meeting, went fishing in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The French were finally routed by <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>'s communists at the battle of <LOCATION> Dien </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bien </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phu </LOCATION>, which ended May 7, 1954. The next morning in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, an international conference, which included the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, took up peace in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. Unlike the current meeting, where even enemies smile at one another, the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conference was held at the height of the Cold War. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulles </PERSON> refused to shake hands with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. Its involvement in the Korean War made <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> eager to avoid another conflict with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. Thus, <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> did little to push the cause of his Vietnamese communist friends who felt cheated and betrayed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> took few initiatives. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was divided at the 17th parallel pending general elections in 1956. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>'s communists took control of the north, while the south moved toward alliance with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The elections never were held. The partition lasted 21 years, and war soon erupted with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces coming to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s aid. An <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that was to have overseen the implementation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement could not carry out its task, a fate that also befell the ICCs in post-1973 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. `` We served on such a commission for 19 years. It certainly was n't a resounding success,'' Canadian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told reporters at the current conference, which hopes to establish an international commission to monitor the Vietnamese troop pullout, a cease-fire and general elections in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and others agree that to succeed, the commission must have a clear mandate, cooperation from all warring parties, and operate within the framework of a comprehensive peace plan.

 Bakeries in this North African nation reopened Saturday after a 24-hour strike when the government agreed to discuss bakers' grievances, including demands for a 25 percent price increase. But a government statement also said the work stoppage was illegal and called on striking bakers to `` show a sense of responsibility and perform their function for society.'' When most bakeries went on strike Friday, huge lines formed outside the few that still were making bread. Bakers are demanding an increase in the price for a standard loaf of French bread from 13 cents to 16 cents. People in this former French colony generally eat French-style bread. Bread is heavily subsidized in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, and a steep price increase in 1983 triggered widespread rioting.

 Opposition leaders praised an accord with the Sandinista government on next year's elections as the foundation for democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The accord, signed Friday after 22 hours of talks between the leftist government and 20 opposition parties, also calls for disbanding the U.S.-backed Contra rebel force. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and his counterparts from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> will discuss the demobilization this weekend at a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the peace process at the summit,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 parties. He said that `` even though the opposition is not completely satisfied, the electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition wants.'' The government promised to put no restraints on campaigning or news coverage. It also agreed to suspend the unpopular military draft from September until after the election, scheduled for Feb. 25. The Sandinistas began compulsory military service for all men aged 17 to 25 in 1983, two years after their war with the Contras began. A cease-fire has been in place since last spring, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels ended and the Contras began retreating to Honduran base camps. About 11,000 rebels and their families are now living in the camps near the Nicaraguan border. The pact is a `` positive base for democratization,'' <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saborio </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference Friday. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, another conservative leader, said the accord will enable the opposition `` to keep demanding democratic guarantees from the Sandinista regime and to continue its struggle.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called the pact `` an important political step'' but said it had not resolved lingering questions about the legal status of oppositon alliances. The Sandinistas sought the talks after complaints by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in earlier elections, their movements constrained and their exposure to the public restricted by news censorship. The accord also calls for a halt to undercover activities during the campaign and promises unconditional amnesty to all political prisoners, including 1,605 rebels in Nicaraguan jails. The Sandinistas have been in power since a 1979 revolution that toppled the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family dictatorship. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began supporting the Contras in 1982 and imposed an economic embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> three years later, arguing that Sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and their close military ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> threatened security in Central America. `` I hope the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will respect this sovereign decision of the Nicaraguan people and change <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and that it puts an end to the -LRB- 1985 -RRB- economic embargo,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said after signing the accord Friday.

 An Afro-Cuban sect that slaughters chickens, turtles and sometimes goats as part of its ritual is challenging a town's ban on the practice, saying it violates religious freedom. A trial began last week in the federal lawsuit filed by <LOCATION> Santeria </LOCATION> priest <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> and his Church of the <PERSON> Lukumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Babalu </PERSON> <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>, the first known church in the usually secretive sect. The dispute between the Santeria church and the town of <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION> raises questions of religious persecution and animal cruelty as it delves into the most unsettling Santeria ritual _ animal sacrifice. The religion was linked _ mistakenly _ to a sadistic drug-smuggling cult after human remains were found in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, last April. Experts on Santeria and its practitioners have said that human bones are not part of any Santeria ritual. But chickens, pigeons, doves and turtles, and occasionally goats and pigs, are sacrificed for the initiation of priests, in faith-healing and for help in love, business and family affairs. Sometimes, the animal remains are cooked and eaten, but in some cases they are left by roadsides or in other public places. The trial in <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>'s lawsuit began Monday and will continue this week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> is hearing the case without a jury. Officials in <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>, a predominantly Hispanic city on the edge of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, deny that their efforts to limit Santeria rituals amount to an attack on religion. Instead, they cite such factors as the possibility of infection spread by animal carcasses, cruelty to animals, and the danger that children who witness the sacrifices will be psychologically scarred. In court documents, city attorneys noted that bans on snake handling and marijuana smoking have been upheld even when the acts are considered an integral element of a religion. Santeria, believed to have more than 50,000 followers in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, had its origins in the region of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that is now <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. It was carried by slaves to Cuban sugar plantations, adopted many Roman Catholic saints as guardians and evolved into a folk religion that remains largely underground. Most adherents are Cubans or Cuban-Americans. <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, 34, says he is trying to remove the stigma against the religion as a low-class practice and institutionalize its rituals, which previously have been performed largely in private homes. After he announced plans for his church in 1987, the city delayed its opening with extensive zoning and building code requirements. `` Once we complied with everything they threw at us, then it became an animal sacrifice issue,'' said <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>. The council voted to outlaw sacrifices, allow animal slaughter only for human consumption, prohibit the possession of animals for slaughter or sacrifice, and incorporate the state animal cruelty law in city ordinances. <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> accuses city council members of discrimination and misusing their political power because of their personal religious convictions. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetli </PERSON>, a witness for the church, testified last week that most Santeria adherents `` are practicing it because of white magic or neutral magic'' to produce good results, not to hurt others. As chief deputy medical examiner in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, he has studied Afro-Caribbean religions as part of his work. In Santeria ceremonies, a few feathers are sometimes plucked from live chickens, but never all of them, he said. A bisected goat left on a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> street and cases when human bones _ apparently obtained after people died of normal causes _ have been boiled in cauldrons were, in his view, signs of a different Afro-Caribbean cult called Palo Mayombe. <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Santeria </ORGANIZATION>'s history of practice in the home hurts his effort to bring the religion into the open, and may have contributed to the mistaken link of Santeria to the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> mass killings this spring. The alleged leader of the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> cult, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, was a Cuban-American raised in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Santeria </LOCATION> practices, but the cult's use of human bones in its rituals deviated from accepted Santeria principles. `` It sets off this domino effect and sort of darkens the idea in people's minds of what we are,'' <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> said. But the attention generated by the mass murders also helped educate the public, he said. `` There is an enormous lack of material in English that seriously deals with the subject matter,'' <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> said, `` which allows for a lot of myths to roam around.''

<HEAD>Tough, Partisan Issues to Greet Congress After Recess</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sense of businesslike calm pervaded the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as lawmakers left for a month-long vacation, but storms loom ahead when they return to face a series of long-deferred divisive issues, from child care to the minimum wage. `` We've gotten the easy stuff out of the way,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership `` September and October are going to be much tougher.'' For the moment, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were content to marvel at what they had accomplished so far despite a year marred by ethics problems and other internal conflicts. Leading the list was a compromise bailout plan for the nation's ailing savings and loan industry, the costliest financial rescue in the nation's history The bill, which also imposes strict new controls on the industry, was worked out in concert with the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also finished initial work on the 13 spending bills that are the essentials of keeping the government running, and steps had been taken toward strengthening the Clean Air Act and meeting the year's budget deficit reduction target. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, too, was well into the process of dealing with spending measures. `` We've picked up ground,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and others gave credit to new Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who two months ago assumed leadership of a chamber bitterly divided and virtually paralyzed by the resignation of former speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> over ethics charges `` It's friendlier,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., the No 2 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership official. `` The entire mood of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is more productive.'' But while <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has restarted the machinery of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which has responsibility for initiating tax and spending bills, he has yet to define a legislative agenda and point the way for the Democratic majority. `` As far as the issue of comity, I think there is a much better relation between the two parties and cooperation between the two leaderships here in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. He noted that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had passed some 150 bills since he assumed the speakership, as many as had been passed in the previous five months. But Democratic leadership aides acknowledge that progress thus far has come on legislative nuts and bolts that have not been a true test of leadership or party cohesion. September and October, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns, will be a time of ideological definition for Democrats, they said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> _ the party's highest elected official _ began that priority-setting process last week in a private luncheon with the Democratic chairmen of House committees, beginning to answer the question of where his party's perspective differs from that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s time to set the agenda has run out, and Democrats now have to answer that question for themselves,'' said a top party aide, speaking only on condition of anonymity. He acknowledged that a sharper drawing of party lines also will bring conflict. `` The major substantive battles are yet to come,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, an influential Republican. `` We will be seeing the issues that will translate into the next election: child care, taxes, economic growth. The stage could be set for some fairly good battles.'' Other than progress on the 13 major spending measures, the list of bills passed so far this year is fairly modest: Items like a $ 900 million farm drought relief bill, natural gas price decontrol, protection for government whistleblowers, and a $ 1.2 billion supplemental money bill for veterans programs. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also, earlier in the year, reached agreement with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a budget outline for the year and on a bipartisan accord on policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that provided continued humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels. But after early expressions of bipartisanship and cooperation, conflicts with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have proliferated in recent months: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed an increase in the minimum wage and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed to override it, leaving the issue moribund. Democrats vow to revive it this fall. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gutted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense priorities, cutting funds for the B-2 stealth bomber, the strategic defense initiative, the rail garrison MX missile and the midgetman missile, while restoring money for two programs he did not want, the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D fighter. The White House hopes to win reversals of some of those positions in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a list of sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which went beyond what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted in the wake of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. _ Both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to restrict the joint U.S.-Japanese development of the FSX fighter aircraft, a move <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed on July 31. An even longer list of problem issues lies ahead: whether to use federal money or offer tax credits to subsidize child care; whether to ban flag burning through a law or a constitutional amendment; how to concoct a new and stronger clean air law; and whether to seek a compromise on the minimum wage. `` While <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> _ he is not manipulative _ he is nonetheless a partisan, liberal Democrat,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` I do n't anticipate a real smooth session.''

 <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> conducted Viennese waltzes in its restaurant, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlova </PERSON> danced in the ballroom, and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON> painted his impressionist views of the Thames from a fifth-floor suite. The Savoy, the distinctly English dream hotel, on Sunday marks 100 years of catering to high society, providing an opulent, discreet and dramatic rendezvous for celebrities, magnates, potentates and royalty. Modeled on the great American hotels of the day, the Savoy was built by impresario <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Oyly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carte </PERSON> adjoining his Savoy Theater, home of the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> operettas. From the outset, it was a byword for exclusivity. Princess <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, later <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, first danced here with Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> got the word he had become prime minister at the Savoy and held War Cabinet meetings in the Pinafore Room. Gen. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> sent his dirty linen from the battle front. The Maharaja of <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION> had 3,000 roses delivered daily. Rock singer <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> left his bath running and flooded three floors. `` Forty years ago, people were excluded mainly because of money,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 78, author of `` The Savoy: A Century of Taste.'' `` There's now a more international flavor, an infiltration which rather destroys the ultra-snobbishness. `` The hotel is not snooty or over-introverted. It has kept a good balance. You've got your dukes and your Sinatras, and they seem to mix very well together,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in an interview. Single rooms go for 140 pounds, or $ 224 a night, while a suite can cost as much as 520 pounds, about $ 832. When it opened in 1889, the Savoy was a wonder of the Victorian age, with 24-hour room service, speaking tubes on every floor, and 67 bathrooms at a time when its most luxurious rival, the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, had just four. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> scorned the built-in washstands, saying that if he wanted hot water he would ring for it. All 202 rooms have buttons marked waiter, valet and maid. The hotel still insists on its own custom-made mattresses, pure linen sheets and towels. It keeps separate kitchens on all eight floors and decorates no two rooms the same, using Art Deco and traditional English country styles. The reservation office keeps 120,000 file cards listing the needs and idiosyncrasies of regular visitors. A staff of 650 attends to 300 guests, who in an average year order 350 pounds of caviar, 9,500 sides of smoked salmon, 52,000 oysters and half a ton of foie gras. Requests are almost never too eccentric. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> hankered after an espresso machine, so the manager bought one for him. An Italian marquise required live rabbits to feed his roommates, a pair of boa constrictors. In 1905, a South African millionaire flooded the forecourt to recreate a Venetian canal, and <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON> serenaded from a gondola. The Maharaja of <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION> booked 35 rooms and installed a silver bathtub and a private elevator in scarlet and gold lacquer. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> golf champion <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> started a tradition of driving golf balls off the roof into a barge on the Thames. Asked how long he would be staying, <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> snapped, `` Till it stops raining.'' But a visitor from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who bought a bulletproof vest and summoned a waiter to test it was politely turned down. Weekend celebrations include a birthday ball, a tea party and fair for 320 disadvantaged children, and a firworks display over the Thames.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today disclosed for the first time that 20 people died and 1,200 suffered radiation-related illnesses in nuclear accidents from 1980-85. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guozhen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needed stricter control over the handling of radioactive waste and that the government plans to build more disposal sites to handle the material. Several accidents involving nuclear waste have been reported in the past, but there have been no official disclosures of deaths. <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> told the paper that ignorance about the dangers of nuclear materials and managers who ignored regulations on handling radioactive waste had caused radiation leaks. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported an accident that occurred last December, when some uranium was lost from a factory and 15 people were exposed to radiation. One man suffered third-degree burns, the report said. In 1986, an article by <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhumou </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said there were cases of exposure to radiation when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear industry started up in the mid-1950s. It said that during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, a serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> said that about 10 people suffered from overexposure to radiation in that accident and that another man got uranium poisoning in an accident in 1973. But he said there had been no cases of acute radiation sickness. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, one man died in an accident in 1986 at the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> atomic plant in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and three people were killed by radiation at an experimental reactor in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> in 1961. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> also reported that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plans to begin construction of nuclear waste sites in eight provinces to handle its growing production of radioactive material. Nuclear dumps already have been built in 12 provinces, it said. It quoted <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> as saying the only major regions that will not have waste storage sites after 1990 would be <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> island and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. He said the facilities are needed to handle waste produced by about 1,000 industries and research establishments across the country. Most of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear waste so far has been generated by the military, but growing amounts are being produced by scientific labs, hospitals and non-military industries. Adding to the waste storage problem is the planned December start-up of the <LOCATION> Qinshan </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> and the 1992 scheduled opening of the <LOCATION> Daya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> plant in southeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> Earlier this year, the paper reported that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was making plans for its first permanent nuclear waste dumps to be built in the coastal <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province and in northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The report in February quoted <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziqiang </PERSON>, director of the safety department of the state <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as saying that so far all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear wastes have been put in concrete basement facilities and those sites only protect the material for about 10 years. Today's report did not describe the facilities being built.

 A landslide Saturday buried about 45 people who had left passenger buses to clear boulders blocking a mountain road in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and all were believed dead, news reports said. State-run television said at least 22 bodies had been recovered. Rescuers were using bulldozers, Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said. All those buried were feared dead, the agency reported. It also said 15 people were hospitalized. The accident occurred 185 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on a national highway connecting <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Passengers had left the two buses to clear the road when more rocks and boulders crashed down on them, Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said. A truck loaded with apples also was buried.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> itched to be done, but Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> was irate. He did n't like a proposal to pay 525 government employees up to $ 134,250 a year, which is more than senators get. `` I think we have within this bill the seeds of the destruction of the civil service system of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` I do not overstate that one iota.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure anyway, and went on to vote to give law enforcement authorities authority to shoot down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs if the pilots ignore warning shots. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to remodel the old mansion occupied by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to better accommodate their three children on the third floor and reversed itself on the question of taxpayer-supported abortions in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. So it goes when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to go. Airplane tickets in hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was determined last week to get out of town. Measures that might not have survived more leisurely scrutiny got voted up or voted down, but disposed of in any event. An aide to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was overheard to observe that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would n't be here in any part of August if the Capitol were n't air conditioned. Prayed the chaplain when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met Wednesday: `` Gracious Father in Heaven, as inevitable tension builds with cosmic issues, often controversial, occasionally confusing, compounded by the relentless ticking of the clock, grant to Thy servants in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> cool heads, warm hearts, patience with each other ...'' From time to time a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> arose to warn <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> terrorists who threatened to kill hostages that American patience had its limits. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rushed back from an out-of-town speaking swing and moved ships _ always trouble signals _ but denied that he was in a crisis mode while working single-mindedly on a diplomatic solution. Meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did its will, and took a couple of surprise turns. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, voting on a federal contribution to the city's budget, refused to deny the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> authority to spend public funds on abortions for the poor That move caught all sides off guard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'd veto the measure if it reached his desk that way. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had done the opposite, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision giving states new leeway on abortion has politicized the issue. With abortion right sentiment strong in polls, 22 members changed their minds. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s ire was aroused by a measure which would raise the pay of 525 key technicians and scientists in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> in order to keep competititive with private enterprise. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, by contrast, get $ 89,500. The Senior Executive Association, which, like <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, opposes piecemeal raises, went nuclear in its denunciation: `` an ill-conceived poisonous stew that will sicken the federal executive corps.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> was equally unhappy with another measure giving law enforcement agents broad authority to bring down planes suspected of carrying drugs and other contraband. He said if he were flying and another plane approached him, he'd probably turn tail and run He lost again. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure by voice vote, sending it, and the pay question, to an uncertain future in the House in the fall. As for refurbishing the 1894 Victorian vice presidential mansion to meet the needs of the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> family, plans originally called for using privately raised funds. But a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee, after sending staff director <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunnels </PERSON> to look the situation over, decided to spend public money. The House approved $ 200,000. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> settled a controversy over whether the cost of bailing out the savings and loan industry should be included in the deficit, as Democrats wanted, or left out, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted, again threatening a veto. The question was resolved in a classic <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> way: splitting the difference. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees decided that 40 percent should be reflected in the deficit, 60 percent left out. And while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> waited for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to pass that vital bill so <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could quit, it passed the time by passing resolutions. One designated Sept. 8 as National Pledge of Allegiance Day. One commended the people of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> for their help when an airliner crashed at their airport. And one _ adopted in the nick of time _ designated next Tuesday as National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day.

 One of the first Soviet visitors to tour the USS Thomas S. Gates looked at the cruiser's on-board helicopter with admiration. `` Great helicopter!'' he told aviator <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` Great country!'' <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> responded, gesturing toward shore. Around this <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port's streets over the weekend, residents mingled in friendship with about 600 seamen from the first two American warships ever to dock here. This city of almost 400,000 people, founded as a Greek colony in 422 B.C., often has known visitors of a less welcome variety. Its strategic position on the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> peninsula across from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> led to attacks over the centuries by Turks, French, British, and Germans. On Saturday, <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> residents mobbed the Americans almost everywhere they went. Many had never seen Westerners because this port city is headquarters of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fleet and normally is a restricted zone. The Ameircan sailors sampled the wares of a local wine factory, relaxed in the local officers' club, and shopped in a military store. They strolled through the seaside town and hobnobbed with locals, many of whom showered them with gifts and invited them home. `` It looks like the Soviets are trying to match what we gave them,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a village in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` So far, it looks like they're doing pretty well.'' Soviet crews of three ships were feted in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, last month as part of the first such Soviet-American exchange of port calls in 14 years. Navigator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, set out to trade some American souvenirs for Soviet items. `` My wife wrote me that she did a little trading when the Soviet fleet hit <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, so I've got to match her,'' he said. Soviet gifts to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors included candy, rubles, children's toys, scarves, flowers, postcards and emblems from Soviet naval uniforms. However, the American ships were ready for the gift exchanges, said <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> native <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, the Gates' chief petty officer. They had special T-shirts printed up and provided sailors with pins, hats and other knickknacks. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, the Gates' dispersing officer, said his ship's crew of 350 had been given a total of about $ 10,000 in rubles to spend in town. `` We're especially curious about how the beer tastes,'' he said. In a store where Soviet military uniforms are sold and only Soviet servicemen are normally allowed to shop, two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors were unfazed when told of the store's restrictions. `` That's okay,'' one said. `` We're military too.'' In fact, plenty of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seamen could be seen sporting Soviet medals and caps. Their own round, white sailor hats graced the heads of more than a few young <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> women. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlatt </PERSON>, the Gates' medical officer, said he wanted to spend his time in <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> exploring Soviet medical practices. One sailor apologized as he extricated himself from a crowd of children and adolescents, explaining, `` Sorry, I'm just all out of pennies.'' Tours of the American ships, the Gates and the frigate USS Kauffman, were scheduled to continue until their departure Tuesday. They arrived Friday. A year ago, the city played host to a small delegation with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secretary. But <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weishaupt </PERSON> said this was the first time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships had docked at <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>. `` This is a very unusual flag to see here,'' agreed former <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Karyakin </PERSON> as he looked at the Stars and Stripes on one of the ships.

<HEAD>China Says Nuclear Accidents Killed 20 in Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Nuclear accidents caused mainly by careless handling of radioactive materials killed 20 people and injured 1,200 in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from 1980 to 1985, an official report said Saturday. <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guozhen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and other radioactive materials, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> did not say how many accidents occurred from 1980 to 1985, and he did not give details of those that did occur, according to the report. Ignorance about the dangers of nuclear materials, and managers who ignored regulations on handling radioactive waste, caused radiation leaks in recent years, the newspaper said. It was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first report on deaths caused by radioactivity. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> previously has disclosed that nuclear accidents had occurred, but it did not acknowledge they had caused severe radiation sickness or deaths. There are no nuclear power plants in operation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although two are under construction. Most of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear waste so far has been generated by the military, but growing amounts are being produced in laboratories, hospitals and non-military industries. Some of the accidents resulted from workers stealing containers used to hold radioactive materials. In December, a carpenter at an electric equipment plant in coastal <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province stole a lead container used to hold cobalt 60, the report said. No deaths or injuries have been reported in that case, it said. In February, the newspaper reported some uranium had been lost from a factory, exposing 15 people to radiation. In 1986, an article by <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhumou </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said an unspecified number of people were exposed to radiation when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear industry started up in the mid-1950s During the tumultuous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, a serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> said. About 10 people were exposed to radiation in that accident and another man got uranium poisoning in 1973, but there were no cases of acute radiation sickness, he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, One man died in an accident in 1986 at the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> atomic plant in <LOCATION> Oklahama </LOCATION>, and three people were killed by radiation at an experimental reactor in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> in 1961. Saturday's report says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plans to build nuclear waste storage facilities to handle the growing volume of radioactive waste produced by about 1,000 industries and research labs. The scheduled start-up of the <LOCATION> Qinshan </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in coastal <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province next December and of the <LOCATION> Daya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> plant in southeast <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province in October 1992 will mean a substantial increase in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s production of nuclear waste. In the past, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stored radioactive waste in concrete basement facilities designed to protect the materials for only 10 years, according to <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziqiang </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> said waste storage facilities now have been built in 12 provinces and are planned for eight others He did not describe the facilities.

<TEXT>
 The mermaids of legend glided effortlessly through the seas, tempting mortals with their beauty and grace. It's not so easy in real life. At Weeki Wachee Spring, hundreds of young women apply each year, but few show the needed athletic skills, fearlessness and good looks to perform far under water at one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s oldest tourist attractions. `` It's tough, there is no doubt about that,'' said <PERSON> Genie </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, mermaid supervisor. `` We have some strict requirements and only a few of the ` girls' actually go on to become mermaids.'' Forty-two years ago, the enormous freshwater spring with startlingly clear water, which extends more than 100 feet down, was turned into a tourist attraction. `` Mermaids'' wearing skin-tight suits that taper into a dolphin-like tail fin gulp air through hoses during the choreographed routines viewed by spectators in a subterranean amphitheater. `` We've done a lot of different things,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` We've eaten bananas and drank <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> underwater. We've recreated scenes from movies. One of the hardest things was eating a sandwich. It gets soggy pretty quick.'' But for beginners, `` I would say the toughest part is learning to only take in only about half a lungful of air,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who performed as a mermaid from 1961 to the early 1970s. `` Otherwise, you will float to the surface.'' The attraction also features an exhibit of photos of living mermaids, and a shrine to swimmer-actress <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Although never a Weeki Wachee mermaid, Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> filmed a movie at the spring and made numerous guest appearances. Despite the specter of discrimination suits, Weeki Wachee remains extremely selective about its mermaids, who now number 26. Several attributes are manadatory: an attractive figure and at least shoulder-length hair, said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. But even most of those with the right looks get shipped back to land following the swimming test. `` The first thing we look for is if you're afraid of the water,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` If you're nervous being underwater, forget it.'' Applicants must swim for 30 minutes, and perform simple underwater ballet and acrobatic moves, such as back flips and deep dives. The few that remain go on to begin serious training and instructions in how to use the air hoses and swim in various costumes. They start at $ 4 an hour and it may take up to a year to pass the apprentice stage, said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Worsham </PERSON>, the veteran mermaid of the staff with 16 years of swimming behind her, recalls watching the mermaids swim around large flowers when she was a little girl. `` From then on, I always wanted to be a mermaid,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Worsham </PERSON>. `` I never expected I would one day be the one here the longest.'' At the end of a show, after the theater had emptied, a mermaid scrubbed algae from the windows with a steel-wool pad. A turtle swam nearby. `` This is part of the job the tourists do n't see,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` Cleaning up is n't part of the myth of the mermaid.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today that it refused to receive a note from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on `` events in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' amid reports that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has assumed a leading role in efforts to free Western hostages. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unnamed foreign ministry official in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> as saying, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration sent a message to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign ministry last week through a third country. Since the content had nothing to do with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the message was not accepted.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the official was responding to reports that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to prevent the killing of Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> gave no further details. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations reported today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had specifically asked <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to intercede after a pro-Iranian group said it killed American hostage Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and another group threatened to kill hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials sought to downplay any negative interpretation of the <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report. `` Basically, we've been trying to get different people to weigh in,'' said one closely involved source who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We have been able to get our messages, one way or another, through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians.'' Meanwhile <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations, flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by helicopter from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for a third day of talks with Lebanese leaders and then left for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> is trying to resolve the fate of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and push efforts to set the hostages free. Before leaving for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> `` is playing an extra part in trying to resolve the hostage problem as <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has done in previous cases.'' He said he had not yet `` obtained concrete proof that Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is dead and I pray he is not dead.'' An extremist Shiite Moslem group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> said it hanged <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> Monday because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to free a Moslem cleric it abducted from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> nine days ago. No body ever has been found, and there have been reports <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> died months earlier. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 44, a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war veteran, was head of a 76-man observer team attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> known as <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988. Sixteen Westerners have been held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the longest nearly 4 -LCB- years. Their plight gained renewed international attention eight days ago when Israeli commandos kidnapped a Shiite Moslem cleric with ties to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, leading to the threats against American captives. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said Friday that a reasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and that he was willing to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> find it. `` I tell the White House the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions _ reasonable, prudent solutions,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said in his sermon in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> at weekly Moslem prayers. His comments appeared to be the strongest indication yet of a possible accommodation between the countries since Islamic fundamentalists ousted the U.S.-backed monarchy in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 10 -LCB- years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Algiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said today that progress was made in talks Friday involving <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON> said in an interview in today's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had assigned an official delegation including politicians and intelligence specialists to the task of `` getting in touch with the parties holding captives.'' The radio report said <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON> met with the spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> _ the group believed to be holding Western hostages _ <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, and with <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>. The talks involved all hostages, whether `` Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis,'' according to the report. `` Progress in this mediation was accomplished,'' it added without elaborating. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said Friday that she was aware of the report but added, `` I have nothing specific on that.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, while proud of its role in mediating past crises, including the 1981 release of American hostages held in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, usually is close-mouthed about its involvement until an issue is settled. The radio report was seen as a sign that Algerian authorities think a deal is close. Today <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> met with army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military cabinet. He also was to meet with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a Syrian-backed mostly Moslem cabinet vying for legitimacy with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published an interview with the head of the Iranian parliament's foreign affairs committee, Said <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON> <PERSON> Khorasani </PERSON>, in which he said he `` deeply regretted'' the killing of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. But he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was to blame. The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, one of the kidnapping groups believed to be fronts for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday it was suspending its death sentence against <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> and replacing it with demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s top leaders conferred about a response to the demands, which <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said must be accepted `` within days.'' It did not say what would happen to <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. <PERSON> Hasnaw </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to intercede in the Ciccipio case and that <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> `` deployed great efforts to defer the execution, for which he is thanked.'' `` Following contacts begun yesterday with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, in the form of pleading and entreaties concerning <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s execution, and after we strongly condemned the abduction of -LRB- the cleric -RRB- ... we counseled patience and self-restraint and called for abstention from dramatic measures and decisions.'' Had <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> been killed, there would have been an `` explosion,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON> as saying. `` It would have led to a dangerous reaction. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have intervened militarily without anyone knowing the full scope or nature of such an intervention,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was inaugurated Thursday, is believed eager to improve ties with the West and erase <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s image as a sponsor of international terrorism. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade the cleric and other <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and for the Western hostages.

<HEAD>Attorney General Downplays Difficulties With Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fresh from stinging defeats in separate battles with conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> brushes aside talk about his difficulties with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm a difficult attorney general, I think,'' a smiling <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters last week after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> killed the nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, his choice to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. In making the comment, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> seemed to revel in the prickly side of his personality, which surfaces frequently in flashes of anger when questioned about sensitive issues by legislators or reporters. That anger flared last week when he blamed <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' defeat on `` raw politics'' and later accused the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of blocking the nominee for failing a `` litmus test'' on civil rights issues. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> denies his political standing was hurt by the losing bouts with Democrats over <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> for the civil rights post, and, earlier, with Republicans over <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to be deputy attorney general. Democrats questioned the qualifications of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a black <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> who has never tried court case but was once sheriff and later chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, a prominent Wall Street lawyer with strong legal credentials, ran afoul of conservative Republicans because of his role in screening President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judicial nominees for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> After his public anger cooled, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> waxed a bit philosophical about <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' defeat last week on a pair of 7-7 votes by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've been in this business a long time. There are some efforts that are worth fighting for,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` It's worth the effort and the criticism that comes from trying to attract good people to serve in government.'' But as he prepares to celebrate the first anniversary of his swearing in this week, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is still searching for people to fill the two important positions at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also is also skirmishing with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over his plans to close the department's 14 organized-crime strike forces and merge them with local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's offices and may be heading for a confrontation by claiming a right to ignore congressional objections to his plans to reorganize the department. The <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> battle has raised some questions about <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s ability to operate on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> dismissed any suggestion <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and his aides misread the situation `` Our people had every expectation that even on a tie vote, the committee would send the name forward to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` I do n't think there was any way for us to predict'' the outcome until an eleventh-hour <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus. `` It's clear that they made the decision late to play hardball.'' After rejecting a motion to recommend <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> on a 7-7 tie, the committee also defeated on the same vote an attempt to report the nomination to the floor for further action. `` This is a journey, you have some things you win, some things you lose,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` The things you lose you learn by them.'' The <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> vote last Tuesday came barely a month after <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> withdrew from consideration for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 spot. Senate Republicans including <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> objected to <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, saying that as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial screening panel he had scuttled some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominees to the federal bench <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> tried to allay the conservatives' suspicions about <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> last spring, telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiske </ORGANIZATION> had help negotiate an agreement whereby the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> consented not to evaluate a judicial candidate's political or ideological views. But <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s announcement blew up in his face hours later when the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> said there was no such agreement. An angry <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> then threatened to cut the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> out of all judicial screening unless his terms were accepted. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> came to terms after a one-month delay, but that gave <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s opponents more time to raise doubts about the appointment and <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> bowed out in early July. `` Something you learn is timing,'' a lesson that can be applied to the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> case as well as the <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> episode, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anybody doubts <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would have been confirmed if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had voted on him prior to all the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> defended the series of high court rulings on civil rights that are unpopular with liberal Democrats, echoing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy that no legislation is needed to overturn them. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>'s answers disturbed several Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, prompting <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> later to accuse the panel of applying too narrow a test on civil rights issues. `` I find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an important area of the law,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters last week. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> maintained that both <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> were victims of the `` politicization of the confirmation process.'' Democrats argued that the issue with <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was not politics, but qualifications. Despite that judgment, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> insists <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is a `` solid guy'' who `` will have a position in the administration'' if he wants it. The same day <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> lost the bitter fight with civil rights groups over <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, the attorney general helped negotiate compromise legislation to end discrimination against the nation's 43 million Americans with disabilities. Civil rights lobbyist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, who fought the attorney general on <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> played a `` very pivotal role behind the scenes'' forging the compromise. `` One of the more fascinating aspect of politics is that today's adversary can be tomorrow's ally,'' <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> said `` In this case it was that today's adversary can be today's ally.''

<HEAD>Congress Hands Bush Victory on First Major Legislative Initiative</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended a bitter, two-day parliamentary standoff early Saturday by adopting a $ 159 billion rescue of the savings and loan industry, handing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a victory on his first major legislative initiative. The bill, described as the most important financial law enacted since the Depression, provides money to close or merge an estimated 500 insolvent thrift institutions and to pay government obligations incurred in the rescue of 223 S & amp; Ls last year. The administration estimates the cost, including interest payments on bonds issued to finance the bailout, at $ 159 billion through 1999. At least half the money will be spent in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where a combination of lax regulatory oversight and an economic downturn sent the industry's losses soaring. Much of the rest goes to other oil-producing states such as <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> where thrifts were permitted to enter businesses far removed from traditional home mortgage lending. `` It is without doubt the single biggest bill in the history of this country,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In a series of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls `` never again'' provisions, the legislation overhauls the regulatory bureaucracy, imposes stringent financial and accounting standards on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and quadruples the maximum jail term for defrauding a financial institution. Analysts say the law will touch the lives of everyone who pays taxes, owns real estate or deposits their money in a thrift institution or bank. The shutdown of sick thrifts paying high interest rates likely will lower rates to all savers because healthy S & amp; Ls and banks have raised theirs to compete for deposits, economists believe. When the government moves to sell an estimated $ 300 billion in real estate inherited from failed S & amp; Ls, the glut of properties could depress prices in already fragile markets, primarily in the Southwest. Many lawmakers, sensitive to the public perception that they in effect are giving taxpayer dollars to crooks and con artists, said the bailout was the only way to protect millions of depositors whose accounts are federally insured up to $ 100,000. `` We are not bailing out S & amp; Ls, we are not bailing out their owners or stockholders. We are standing behind our promise to protect the savers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Legislators, nevertheless, were reluctant to vote for the measure. But, about five minutes after midnight, the bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a 201-175 vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had approved it less than two hours earlier in an unusual procedure that avoided a record of which members voted for and which against. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking panel, said the rare `` division'' vote, in which senators stand to cast their ballot, was used as part of informal arrangement that unsnarled a parliamentary tangle involving unrelated measures <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said the bill would have passed with about 70 votes had a roll call been taken. The S & amp; L bill, which runs to nearly 1,000 pages, is the first major piece of legislation initiated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Only two weeks after taking office, the president called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act in 45 days to stem a financial emergency inherited from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. It took <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> six months, but lawmakers gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> substantially what he wanted. The crisis had been building for years, but was little discussed in government outside of regulatory agencies and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' banking committees. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and his Democratic opponent, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, virtually ignored the issue during the 1988 election campaign. The final dispute holding up passage had little to do with the S & amp; L problem and much to do with the political struggle between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration over balancing the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to finance $ 50 billion of the program through a new, quasi-private agency, thus keeping S & amp; L spending from ballooning the federal budget deficit, which in turn would trigger automatic, across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Democrats, trying to pressure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into reneging on his `` no new taxes'' pledge, wanted to embarrass the administration with climbing annual deficits. They would have avoided the spending cuts by simply waiving Gramm-Rudman. The White House claimed that would have set a precedent opening the way for a congressional spending spree on other projects. Democrats said their plan saves billions of dollars in interest costs because the government would borrow bailout money with regular <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> debt. On Thursday morning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened to veto the S & amp; L bill unless it included his funding plan. Shrugging off the threat, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 221-199 to adopt the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, fell six votes short of the 60 needed to waive Gramm-Rudman and sent the legislation back to a conference between the two chambers. With the participation of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, congressional negotiators worked out a compromise late Thursday night. Twenty billion dollars will be raised this year under the Democratic plan, inflating the deficit to about $ 168 billion, the highest in three years. The remaining $ 30 billion will be raised under the president's scheme, keeping the spending out of the deficit in 1990 and 1991. On Friday, opposition to the pact from two influential House chairmen, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., of the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, jeopardized final `` There is a time to fold and there is a time to be bold,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said, urging Democrats hold out for their plan through the early morning hours. But he and other speakers were interrupted with periodic shouts of `` Vote! Vote!'' from members anxious to follow their 51 colleagues who had already gone home. In the end, the lure of summer vacation proved more powerful. Enough Democrats folded to allow Republicans to pass the compromise.

<TEXT>
 Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> got a full six hours sleep Wednesday night for the first time in five days. His waking hours were spent in a frenetic race from television studios to the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, from radio booths to White House offices. Such was <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>'s visibility that one senior White House official suggested he switch jobs and become a media star. `` We mounted a paramount information campaign,'' said the soft-spoken envoy who has represented his country in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the past two years, which have been some of the most turbulent in the 40-year-old relationship between the two allies. By satellite from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, telefax machines in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and airwaves around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials sought to deflect accusations _ made privately by some administration officials and publicly by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnapping of a Lebanese cleric was a cavalier act that endangered American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We acted in a coordinated fashion, in a widesweeping and intensive way. We were all mobilized in this campaign,'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said. The Israelis swung into action on Monday, hours after a group calling itself The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> released a videotape purporting to show the hanged body of kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s July 28 kidnapping of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> appeared on two prime-time television news shows that evening, followed by Israeli Arab Affairs Minister <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> was up early Tuesday for a 7 <ORGANIZATION> a.m. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> program. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> followed minutes later from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` At the embassy, meanwhile, secretaries were faxing to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the media a list of terrorist acts, including car bombings and infiltration attempts into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, allegedly planned by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in his capacity as a leader of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was directly responsible for the <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnapping in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> 17 months ago, and may also have been responsible for his death `` I think in retrospect we will see that we struck a very effective blow against terrorism,'' he said. On Tuesday, reactions started coming in. The embassy said it received 135 calls, of which 124 praised <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for its tough stance against terrorism. A handful were hate calls, said one staffer. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> worked the phones, too, calling dozens of lawmakers to explain <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position and elicit their views. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and several <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members publicly criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for reckless behavior and for failing to consult the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> conceded that other lawmakers and officials held similar views. `` It was important to nip that in the bud,'' he said. `` The administration initially appeared undecided'' about whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should or should n't be blamed, he said. Indeed, while <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was careful on Monday not to criticize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s actions, he also told reporters that, `` It is fair to say that many people do share the senator's -LRB- <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s -RRB- concern. By Wednesday, `` people were talking about what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should do to save the hostages, not who it should blame,'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a nation of 4.3 million isolated among hostile Arab nations, is highly sensitive to its image abroad. It long enjoyed virtual blanket approval from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the American public, but both have adopted a more questioning attitude in recent years. Crises in relations with its main financial backer and diplomatic ally highlight Israelis' feelings that the world ignores the Arab threat to their security and treats them according to a double standard. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is in a war, fighting against an enemy that does n't play by the norms and rules that the West shares Put otherwise, you ca n't wear kid gloves in a brass knuckle neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. By Thursday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had placed a whole new construction on its kidnapping of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the issue of the 16 American and European hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by shadowy Shiite Moslem groups had been `` swept under the rug'' for a long time, until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> revived it with the <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> abduction. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s action would not only `` capture the headlines,'' but also bring about the captives' freedom.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday voted final passage of a landmark savings and loan bill described as the most significant piece of financial legislation in 50 years. Here are the highlights of the bill:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 According to the latest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration estimate, the bailout will cost $ 159 billion through 1999. That includes $ 60.5 billion to meet government obligations incurred in the rescue of 223 S & amp; Ls in 1988, $ 74.2 billion to close or merge more than 500 additional S & amp; Ls and $ 24.4 billion for the government's share of interest on bonds sold to help pay for the bailout. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' General Accounting Office estimates the cost, with interest over 30 years, at $ 285 billion Of that, $ 157 billion will come from the taxpayers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In the most important reform in the bill, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners, 120 days after enactment, will be required to invest more of their own capital in their institutions. The provision, aimed at discouraging risky investments, requires owners to back every $ 100 they lend with $ 1.50 in tangible capital. By 1995, the standard will be $ 3. Many of the accounting loopholes that allowed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners to avoid capital requirements have been closed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INSURANCE PREMIUMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Both S & amp; Ls and commercial banks will pay more for the government deposit insurance that protects savers' accounts up to $ 100,000. Bank premiums will jump from 8 cents per $ 100 to 15 cents. S & amp; L premiums will rise from 20.8 cents to 23 cents. Analysts believe some of the expense will be passed on to savers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCIAL STANDARDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The bill pushes S & amp; Ls back into home mortgage lending and out of risky investments such as speculative commercial real estate projects and junk bonds. Thrift institutions are required to raise the level of housing and housing-related loans in their portfolios to 70 percent, up from the current 60 percent requirement. S & amp; Ls currently involved in risky ventures will have five years to phase out their investments. After that, they can invest in those areas only through separately capitalized affiliates that involve no risk to insured deposits.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUREAUCRACY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The lead S & amp; L regulatory agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, is being dismantled. Its regulatory divisions will be transferred to a new agency within the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The fund insuring S & amp; L deposits moves to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which already insures commercial banks. The 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, which are owned by the industry, remain independent. They will lose their regulatory power but continue to provide low-cost financing to S & amp; Ls.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOUSING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The industry-owned regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> will be required to earmark $ 50 million a year, increasing to $ 100 million, to help finance housing for poor people.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTI-DISCRIMINATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Banks and S & amp; Ls will have to disclose reports from federal regulators evaluating how well they serve poor and minority neighborhoods. Mortgage lenders will be required to collect and disclose data on the race, sex and income level of customers and loan applicants.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAL ESTATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A new agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will be created to sell more than $ 300 billion in real estate now owned by bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will do the work, overseen by a board headed by the treasury secretary. The government will be required to give housing authorities and non-profit agencies first chance to buy housing from the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. Some fear the massive property sales will further damage real estate markets in already-depressed oil-producing regions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTI-FRAUD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is getting $ 75 million a year for the next three years to uncover and prosecute fraud at both S & amp; Ls and banks. It is directed to establish a special fraud task force in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where most S & amp; L problems are centered. Maximum fines for financial institution fraud are being raised from $ 5,000 a day to $ 1 million and the maximum jail term from five years to 20 years.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Saturday portrayed a gloomy picture of an economy sliding toward disaster with a national debt of nearly $ 500 billion and growing faster than that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The revelation was made in a speech by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> to the Supreme Soviet, or legislature. Despite the dismal prognosis, <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>'s speech was markedly different from previous statements by Soviet economic authorities in that he acknowledged some key problems and outlined ways to solve them. The proposals likely will be taken up by the Supreme Soviet when it considers the 1990 budget in a session that begins Sept. 25. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, speaking in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week, reported the latest sad joke: The difference between an optimist and a pessimist, he said, depends on whether a person expects economic disaster to strike the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in one, two or five years. Soviet stores are expected to become even more barren because wages now are rising twice as fast as the production of consumer goods, according to <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>'s figures. Imports alone are not the answer, he said. `` No foreign uncle is going to solve this problem for us,'' he warned. Inflationary pressures are growing, and the deficit for 1989 is now projected at $ 192 billion, up 20 percent from estimates given six months ago. That is four times more than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit in terms of the economy's ability to adjust to it. The Soviet deficit amounts to 13.8 percent of all the country's goods and services produced in a year. In November, Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> made world headlines by admitting to a budget deficit for the first time, but his figure hid two-thirds of the deficit with bookkeeping tricks. In his speech, made Friday and reported Saturday by Pravda, <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> called for an end to such smoke screens. He proposed issuing government bonds to cover the deficit and paying interest to savers. That would sop up some of the public's extra cash, which it is now trying to spend on inadequate supplies of consumer goods, <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said. `` We must stop the worsening of the economic situation and social tension,'' he said. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet miners went on strike in July, in part because of shortages of housing and simple goods like soap and meat. In 1990, the government plans for consumer goods production to grow 11 times faster than heavy industry, he said. Already this year, government investment in factories and machinery has dropped by 30 percent, he said. That would be a dramatic turnaround for the Soviet government, which has traditionally emphasized heavy industry and defense at the expense of housing and consumer goods. But even <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>'s promised doubling and tripling of the growth rates for manufacturing of televisions and washing machines will meet just a tiny fraction of the demand. For example, the growth rate for television manufacturing will triple _ bringing total production to 10.6 million sets a year for a population of 287 million. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said the deficit could be cut in half next year by reducing the losses at state enterprises and trimming defense spending and government investment in industry.

 Coal miners in the far northern <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> region walked off their jobs Saturday but then agreed that government concessions are generous enough to keep them at work at least until next year, official reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said thousands of miners shut down 11 of 13 mines in the coal-rich <LOCATION> Pechora </LOCATION> field north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> but agreed to start working again at midnight after officials explained concessions included in a government decree. `` At a joint conference, representatives of mines and enterprises of the town unanimously decided to stop the strike until Jan. 1, 1990, and to start working from midnight,'' state TV reported. It did not say what would happen after the first of the year. Workers decided Friday to stay off the job until they received the full text of a government decree that officials say fulfills promises made to end a wave of strikes last month. The promises included bonuses for night work and for miners who use dangerous equipment, and better pension and overtime benefits. The government also made general pledges to improve housing and end shortages of food and consumer goods. A spokesman at the Organizational Department of the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuryupa </PERSON>, a director of the state enterprise that operates all 13 mines, brought a copy of the decree from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, 1,100 miles to the southwest, and explained it to the workers Saturday. The miners then held a closed meeting to decide whether to go back to work, said the official, who declined to identify himself. `` Emotions have stabilized and now there are no outbursts,'' he said. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called last month's strikes by hundreds of thousands of coal miners the greatest trial of his 4 -LCB- years in power He sympathized with the workers but urged them to return to their jobs. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told the official media Friday that the settlement with the miners would cost about $ 3.2 billion. He said it would be difficult for the government to come up with the money and told other workers that if they strike they will hurt only themselves. `` If we follow the road of strikes, no one will benefit from it and low-paid sections of the population will be hit first,'' he said in a television interview. The <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> miners first struck July 19, several days after thousands of miners in other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> already had walked out. They demanded better living and working conditions and that the government pay more attention to the problems of workers in the far north. They returned to work after about a week. Workers in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, where the strikes began, conducted a two-hour warning strike Thursday because they said the government is not living up to its promise to shut down a hydroelectric project the miners say is damaging the environment.

 The pain wo n't end for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> until his brother <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and all the other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> come home. But even after an agonizing week in which his brother was under a death sentence by his Moslem captors for several days, <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> is certain the hostages will be freed one day. `` I think if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and all of the other governments would stick together now, I'm sure they'll be able to end the hostage situation,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said Friday from <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>. He said his family planned to spend the weekend trying to get their lives back on an even keel after a week in which another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage was reported hanged, four deadlines for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s death were set and then canceled, his wife made an extraordinary plea for her husband's safety, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> appealed in a videotape for the release of a Lebanese clergyman seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last month. `` Life must go on,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said. `` Of course, we always think about <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. There's no way you can do anything without thinking about <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> was on his way to work as acting comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said it would kill him if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the Shiite Moslem spiritual leader Israeli commandos captured in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28. The threat to <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> came shortly after another pro-Iranian group claimed it had hanged Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s action. A videotape that seemed to show the body of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> hanging from a noose was issued, but no body has been found and some reports have said he was killed months ago. <PERSON> Elham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghandour </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> married in 1985, pleaded Tuesday for the captors to `` review their consciences and stop from carrying out'' the killing. The captors' first deadline, 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday, was pushed back four hours and then until Thursday. The captors said they were responding to `` friendly appeals'' and the plea from Mrs. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. By Thursday, when the new deadline approached, scores of journalists were trampling the lawn outside <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s suburban split-level home Early in the day, it was extended three hours, and a videotaped message with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> urging <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s release was made public in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Just before 2 p.m., the captors said they had called off the killing and replaced it with demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners. They said they would provide a list to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The news made the <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> family jubilant. `` We were all so extremely happy,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said. `` It was just a case of joy and tears and kisses and hugs and everything else.'' But he stressed that the family's ordeal wo n't end even if his brother is freed. `` What it would really take is not only to have <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> knock on my front door, but to have all of the hostages be able to go home and knock on their own front door,'' he said. `` We ca n't forget the rest of the hostages. They're all a part of us now.'' `` Most of all I'd like to see Lt. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> come back and be able to knock on his front door,'' <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said. `` I have a feeling that the colonel is still alive.'' Not counting <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 16 Westerners including eight Americans are believed to be held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was seized March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said he felt no rancor toward his brother's captors. `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> is still alive,'' he said. `` If he was n't alive, it may be a different story. All of the other American hostages, as far as I know, are still alive. So there's no way I can say I hate them.'' And <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said he did n't mind what the journalists had done to his lawn. `` Perhaps they can all come back tomorrow and retrample it,'' he said. `` I do n't care if we have twice as many people come, that is if we get word that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> is free.''

<HEAD>Algeria: Skilled Broker in Hostage Crises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This Moslem Arab country has combined strong revolutionary credentials, good Western contacts, and deft diplomacy to forge a reputation as a successful mediator of hostage crises. It counts among its negotiating coups the release in January 1981 of Americans who were held hostage at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. This North African country's envoys are once again playing the role of mediator: this time in the hostage crisis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is no stranger to that country's turmoil. Though <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s exact role never has been spelled out, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials thanked the nation publicly after French hostages were released by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1987-1988. `` We have a skill that we put at the disposal of the international community,'' the Algerian ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON>, told reporters in April 1988. He spoke after Shiite Moslem hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner gave up the plane in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and were apparently allowed to escape. <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> said he could not provide details of the agreement because it would break <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s word to the hijackers and damage its chances of helping in such situations in the future. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> criticized the decision to release the Kuwaiti hijackers, who killed two passengers. In response, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> rejected what it called an effort `` to fling discredit on an action which saved precious human lives from murderous violence.'' Perhaps the most prominent Algerian success came Jan. 20, 1981, when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages held 444 days in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> stepped off an airliner at the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had cut a deal _ after months of mediation by Algerian diplomats. `` A happy ending might change the American view that we are communists,'' a senior Algerian official said at the time. After a war with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that led to independence in 1962, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> pursued socialist policies and shaped close ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and radical Moslem groups. While <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is often in clear sympathy with the aims of radical organizations, it has steered clear of supporting terrorist tactics. In October 1977, Algerian officials negotiated at the foot of a Japanese DC-8 hijacked by guerrillas from a group known as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Algerians helped win freedom for hostages in exchange for a $ 6 million ransom and the release of six of the militants' comrades in Japanese jails In this case, the hijackers also were apparently allowed to leave <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>.

 The pro-Iranian extremist group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday named five Palestinians and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> whom it said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should release along with an abducted Moslem cleric. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> also denied holding any negotiations on a possible prisoner exchange with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Shiite Moslem organization was reacting to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s July 28 abduction from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it will trade the cleric, whom it links to terrorism, and up to 60 other Shiites for three Israeli prisoners and the 17 foreigners held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said the abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> has `` blocked chances for a swap,'' but it also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should `` free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> first.'' One Shiite group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> claimed it killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> it held hostage in retaliation for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction. A second group threatened to kill another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> but later said it had issued a reprieve. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s statement came the same day a ranking <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishop crossed into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual guide, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>. Bishop <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Abi-Nadir </PERSON> told reporters he carried a message from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> asking that the body of the Marine, Lt.

It quoted an unidentified `` responsible source'' in <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> as saying: `` We are as eager to obtain -LRB- their -RRB- release as much as we are eager to obtain the release of the detainees who belong to the sons of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Zaloum </PERSON> stabbed two Israelis to death in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> carried out an attack on a bus. Ms. <PERSON> Alyan </PERSON> was arrested before she could carry out a bombing in August 1987. <PERSON> Yaseen </PERSON> was arrested and accused of preparing an attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 A scholarship fund started for Lt.

On Monday, his captors released a videotape that seemed to show <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> hanging from a noose, saying he had been killed in retaliation for the Israelis' seizure the previous week of a Shiite Moslem cleric. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have speculated that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> actually was killed some time earlier. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, originally intended to gather enough money to assist <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' 19-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 More than 100,000 people were marooned, many on roofs, after rivers burst their embankments and caused floods that killed at least 150 people in the last two weeks, officials and news reports said Saturday. The torrential rains ended Thursday, and officials said river embankments had burst at 17 places, washing away mud-and-straw houses in at least 100 villages. They said floods had affected some 250,000 people. The area most severely hit was the tea-growing <LOCATION> Zakiganj </LOCATION> area in <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> district, 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a Relief Ministry official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least 10 people died of diarrhea in <LOCATION> Zakiganj </LOCATION> in the last three days. At least 1,000 others were affected by the disease caused by dirty drinking water, he said. News reports reaching <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> said at least 150 people died in the <LOCATION> Zakiganj </LOCATION> area as a result of the rains in the past two weeks. The government has sent 12 medical teams to <PERSON> Zakiganj </PERSON>. `` The situation is quite alarming. We are trying our best to evacuate the marooned people, but we do n't have enough speedboats,'' said an official who visited the area Friday. Many people were stranded on roofs with floodwaters around them, and some had built makeshift bamboo platforms, he said. `` Many people have grain, but they have no dry place to cook,'' he said. The Flood Forecasting Center said water was receding in the <LOCATION> Kushiara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zakiganj </LOCATION> but was still above the danger level. Flooding is an annual problem in this impoverished nation of 110 million. More than 1,400 people were killed last year in floods that submerged three-fourths of the country.

 For a few moments, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> fund-raising dinner looked like the good old days before Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s fifth term turned into a tangle of investigations that cut into his reputation of integrity. As <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> took the podium last week in a hotel ballroom, 800 organized labor activists stood and applauded. Pocket cameras flashed. Busboys turned from clearing tables to catch a look at the mayor. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was in characteristic form, tall and athletic like the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> track star he used to be, his voice deep and monotone as he delivered a speech praising organized labor. The mayor gave no clue of the problems dogging the fifth term he won in April _ the allegations of conflict of interest and influence peddling, accusations of coverup and speculation that he may resign. City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> is probing, among other things, the mayor's ties to two financial institutions that paid <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> while doing business with the city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who denies any wrongdoing, said Friday he has established an account for supporter contributions to cover his legal expenses. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s probe, expected to be completed by mid-September, hangs over City Hall. `` All conversations begin with a discussion of this. It's the first thing people say as they shake your hand,'' said <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Picus </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Shortly before the election, newspaper reports said the city treasurer directed the deposit of $ 2 million in a bank paying $ 18,000 to the mayor to act as adviser. The deposit was made in <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on the day the mayor called Treasurer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON>, and one day after the mayor spoke with the bank president about the city's failure to renew a $ 1 million certificate of deposit. <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> denied the mayor influenced him and the mayor denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> returned the $ 18,000, and made it through the election, barely avoiding a runoff. But questions persisted. An official in the treasurer's office testified before a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> committee that his two bosses, including <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON>, tried to cover up the mayor's role in the Far East deposit, an allegation <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> denies. The official, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehlmeyer </PERSON>, said a city form was doctored so that the notation `` per the mayor'' next to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> deposit record was covered with correction fluid. `` I was stunned to hear the mayor was even involved,'' said <PERSON> Sehlmeyer </PERSON>. Other probes of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> include: _ A city-funded <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> task force whose executive director, <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, is involved in a lucrative real estate deal with the mayor. Ms. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> has been charged with misdemeanor failure to comply with a subpoena after refusing to turn over documents on $ 180,000 in task force checks written to herself, or for `` cash.'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is looking into whether investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> gave the mayor favorable treatment in stock deals in exchange for favored treatment by the city. _ The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing whether <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s stock and bond trades were tainted by insider trading. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelman </PERSON>, executive director of the political watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s acceptance of money from <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was `` pretty unusual and pretty blatant and a really serious mistake.'' The mayor also was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan to act as adviser while that institution was doing business with the city. If <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> did use his influence to direct city dollars to the institutions, he could face criminal charges, said <PERSON> Zelman </PERSON>. But until the city attorney completes his investigation, many city officials and business leaders refuse to speculate about the mayor. `` Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who opposed <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> in the last election. `` You do n't jump up and down on a guy just because he's been accused.'' But even the mayor's supporters said they have found it hard to believe he would work for a bank that was doing business with the city. `` In all the years I've known him, I've never known him before these matters came up to be anything but completely honest and forthright,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milke </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. `` In that way it's a surprise that he would even allow these things to happen.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Saturday it has refused to accept a message from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman working on the issue talked of `` optimism in the air.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a government source said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had succeeded in communicating with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is believed to have strong influence over groups holding hostages. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> assumed a leading role in efforts to win release of the captives. The pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the umbrella for factions holding hostages, named five prisoners held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that it wants released, in addition to a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The statement indirectly endorsed demands made Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> after it suspended threats to kill American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said it was exploring all ways of winning freedom for hostages but would not engage in `` public debate'' on the demands. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration sent a message to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> last week through a third country. Since the content had nothing to do with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the message was not accepted.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied involvement in hostage-taking. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the official was responding to reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a message to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to prevent the killing of hostages. It gave no further details. A closely involved source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity, `` Basically, we've been trying to get different people to weigh in.'' `` We have been able to get our messages, one way or another, through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians,'' the source said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, on Friday offered to help solve the hostage problem. However, he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem clergyman abducted July 28 from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. On Monday, a pro-Iranian group said it hanged an American hostage, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Revolutionary Justice then threatened to kill <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> but said Thursday it was `` freezing'' the order while demanding freedom for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese prisoners in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has accused <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> of instigating attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and has offered to free him only if the foreign hostages and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are freed. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s original offer stands and that the country refuses to `` engage in a public debate'' over <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> demands. `` We are holding contacts and making efforts to bring about the release of hostages and prisoners and it's not worthwhile to add any details now,'' he said. There are 16 foreigners, including eight Americans, held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations, <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, told a news conference there was `` optimism in the air'' in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> about the release of hostages. But he warned there would be no `` quick fixes, no simple solution.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where he was investigating the killing of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was working with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer force when he was abducted in February 1988. After three days of discussions in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said he had not yet `` obtained concrete proof that Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is dead, and I pray he is not dead.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they are virtually certain <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is dead. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> also told reporters: `` <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is playing an extra part in trying to resolve the hostage problem as <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has done in previous cases.'' The North African country, which has strong ties to both the West and radical Moslem groups, has successfully mediated hostage crises in the past 10 years. Algerian diplomats helped win the release of American hostages in January 1981 after they were held 444 days at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON>, was quoted Saturday by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations as saying his country was undertaking a new initiative to free all hostages. Radio Algiers said his talks involved all hostages, whether `` Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis.'' It cited `` progress in this mediation.'' Several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had specifically asked <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to intercede. A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday demanded freedom from Israeli prisons of five `` uprising heroes,'' identified as <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaloum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Itaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Alyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> and `` Lebanese resistance heroes'' <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaseen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON>. It also demanded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> release <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, Palestinians jailed during the anti-Israeli uprising in the occupied territories, and guerrillas it has captured.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent tanks and rocket launchers to the edge of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sector Saturday, indicating it may be preparing to invade or fend off a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> assault, police said. The artillery movement followed a savage shelling duel on residential neighborhoods that killed 21 people and wounded 82, police said. They said 10 of the victims died when mortar shells hit an underground shelter. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> called it a `` shelling storm.'' Among the dead were seven soldiers serving under Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> half of this nation's divided government. A police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said it was not clear if the Syrian reinforcements `` are a prelude to storming the Christian sector or facing an invasion by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces.'' The movement could also be intended as a show of force. Both sectors of the city have been buzzing with rumors that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces were planning to storm Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an effort to drive out the Syrians and seize <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central bank. It contains the nation's currency reserves. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who sparked the current round of fighting 20 weeks ago by blockading militia-run ports, has vowed to force the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians arrived under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, but <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says they betrayed that mandate by siding with Moslem militias in the civil war. The spokesman said the tanks, mostly Soviet-designed T-62s, rolled down the central Lebanese mountains from east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, clogging traffic along the Beirut-Damascus highway They took up positions on hills overlooking <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as well as the three-mile Green Line that splits the city into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> zones, the spokesman said. Dozens of multi-barreled rocket launchers, which fire 40 rockets a minute, were deployed in several poor neighborhoods along the Moslem side of the line. Earlier Saturday, a six-hour barrage took casualties in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the surrounding mountain villages and the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, according to the police spokesman. A reliable <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> source said seven of those killed in the shelter, beneath a residential building in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Fayadiyeh </LOCATION>, were Lebanese army soldiers. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the targeted building was used by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army as a communications station. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command refused comment on the report. The shelter was hit by three 240mm mortar shells fired from a Syrian emplacement in <LOCATION> Baaleshmeieh </LOCATION>, a few miles east of <LOCATION> Fayadiyeh </LOCATION>. The shells pierced the parking lot of the 10-story building and blasted the shelter, he said, causing part of the building to collapse and burying the victims. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the suburb of <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>, 1.5 miles east of <LOCATION> Fayadiyeh </LOCATION>, sent hundreds of soldiers to evacuate casualties from the collapsed shelter, the police spokesman said. He said casualties were taken away in armored personnel carriers because `` it was very risky for ambulances to operate due to the intensity of the barrage.'' At peak times of the duel, according to the spokesman, 60 shells per minute were being fired. He said the two sides fired about 10,000 shells and rockets in the exchange. By police count, the 20-week-old confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops and the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has killed 537 people and wounded 2,266 Moslems are fighting for a greater share of power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has been controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority. The latest duel began late Friday and sent civilians fleeing to basements and underground shelters. It escalated sharply after the Syrians hit the shelter, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners and their right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> allies, the Lebanese Forces militia, entrenched in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 310-square-mile Christian enclave, `` responded heavily,'' the spokesman said. Christian militia gunners sprayed residential districts in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other Moslem areas with Grad missiles from rocket launchers, according to the spokesman. He said the 122mm projectiles left gaping holes in apartment buildings, shattering walls and glass and starting several fires. Syrian gunners, manning howitzer emplacements along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside boulevard, responded by firing on residential distriacts in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The exchanges spread to Moslem Druse and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> mountains, south and northeast of the capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners also shelled the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>, which commands the Syrian army's supply routes from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the police spokesman said.

 Horse owners are increasing security to protect against saddle rustlers who cut through fences and locks to raid stables. Since April, more than 110 saddles with an estimated value of more than $ 65,000 have been reported stolen from Twin Cities-area stables and individuals. `` They are probably taking them to large horse auctions and peddling them,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, one of the stable operators affected. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, field editor for the Quarter Horse Journal in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said thieves have been stealing saddles for years. `` A custom built saddle can easily run $ 2,000,'' he said. `` And depending on who makes it, it can be two, three times that. You take a $ 2,000 saddle and it would not be hard to get $ 500 for it real quick.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is offering a $ 500 reward for information on the saddle thieves.

<HEAD>Plymouth Rock Beginning to Crack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION>, which attracts 1 million tourists a year, has started to crack open along the same line where a 1774 split was repaired in 1880. Tourists are n't likely to notice the crack but state officials are worried. They have approached local and state historical groups to coordinate the preservation of the rock. `` It's not a major task, and it's not expensive, but it's just such a very important landmark we do n't want to create any waves,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Matinzi </PERSON>, superintendent of Pilgrim Memorial State Park for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Waves crashing over the rock on the beach at <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> are just what have caused the old mortar to erode and the rock to crack. In the 1880 repair job, the pieces never quite fit and the cement line was always visible. The rock weighs about six tons and is about 14 feet wide and 6 feet long. <PERSON> Matinzi </PERSON>'s plan involves digging out the sand to expose the total rock and then adding new mortar to hold the two pieces together. `` The poor rock has gotten knocked around so much, and it gets covered every tide,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON>, a research librarian at <ORGANIZATION> Plimoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION>, which uses an old spelling of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>. `` If they do n't do something, the froth will get in and split it.'' Legend, and some historians, have it that the first Pilgrim landing party used the rock to step ashore in December 1620. `` In December, wading is not high on the list of things to do,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` The interest of the Pilgrims was to find a place to get off at a relatively high spot and there was no other obvious landing spot for several hundred feet north or south.'' The rock's troubles began when the Sons of <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> decided to move it to the town square in 1774. The rock was dropped and broken, so they left two-thirds behind on the beach and moved one-third to town. But tourists kept chipping away at the smaller piece, so in 1880 it was taken back where it came from and the two sections patched together. The crack was n't all bad. At the time it occurred, locals saw the break as symbolic of the split between the colonies and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had watched a hostage crisis help destroy one president and ensnarl another in scandal, so he knew full well he was plunging into high-risk territory when terrorists claimed to have killed one American and set an execution date for another in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. For the first six months of his presidency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been largely spared from any pressures over the hostages' plight, even though nine Americans remained in captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. That suddenly changed after Israeli commandos seized a Shiite Moslem cleric in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Three days later, a shadowy organization called the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> declared it had hanged Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and released a videotape purportedly showing the execution. Suddenly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began to feel the sting of experiences that had bludgeoned <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of `` the overwhelming events'' of the hostage crisis and commented, `` These are not easy days.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending the weekend with family at the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, while national security aides monitored the hostage developments at the White House. The president did not have any policy staff with him and the hostage situation was considered `` stabilized,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said Saturday. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did routine paperwork, received intelligence briefing materials and made phone calls during the morning, then played tennis and went swimming.

After a long suspense, as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> waged its intense diplomatic effort and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> put on a display of military muscle in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> got a temporary reprieve from his captors. No one knew for sure why <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s sentenced was suspended. `` I like to think that a broad-spread appeal to nations in every corner of the globe had something to do with it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The outcome spared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ at least temporarily _ from pressure to find an appropriate way to punish the terrorists without endangering the remaining hostages or innocent civilians. Even so, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday, `` I feel the burden of going to every end possible to try to find _ get the return of these Americans to their loved ones and find out the truth about Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' Such a burden can be perilous to presidents. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> became branded as a presidency held hostage by the 441-day captivity of Americans in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the ordeal, including a disastrous rescue attempt, helped drive him from office. For <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the kidnapping of Americans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> led the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> into the improbable Iran-Contra affair with embarrassing revelations about criminal wrongdoing and clumsy attempts to trade arms for hostages. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` looked the same way all presidents look when they get to a hostage crisis. He looked ineffectual and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> look helpless. `` He's under pressure to do something and there's nothing he can do,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` He rediscovered a lesson he should have learned ... to resist the temptation to allow these things to become a serious national crisis because you can not control events.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had performed well. `` He's a naturally cautious man and this is one of those times when it was probably useful,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had learned from the experiences of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. With the announcement of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cut short a speech-making trip in the West and rushed back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, hurriedly ordered a meeting Monday with military, diplomatic and national security advisers, and then delivered a briefing to congressional leaders. High-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials were seen entering the White House carrying large charts and maps, giving rise to speculation that a military strike was being planned. Nothing happened after the apparent shift to a crisis mode. At the Tuesday morning meeting of top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides, chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> emphasized the limitations <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faced in trying to employ military options. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, a high-ranking aide, described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` outraged, incensed, but cognizant of the limitations on his options and the need to be responsible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself acknowledged in a 1986 report on terrorism that retaliation was not an easy course. `` Our principles of justice will not permit random retaliation against groups of countries,'' the report said. The White House began to reverse course. There was no crisis and the government was not being immobilized by terrorists, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went ahead with a festive barbecue on the South Lawn Tuesday night. With the immediate crisis behind him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to follow up an offer from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, to help find a solution to the hostage crisis. There also were intriguing clues that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had been helpful. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hoped last week's developments `` may open up some opportunity for improvement over the long haul. ... I do n't think we're back at square one.''

<TEXT>
 The following is a translation by The Associated Press of the Arab text of a statement issued Saturday by the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The statement quoted an unidentified `` responsible source'' at the party as saying: `` Since the entity of Zionist terrorism committed the crime of kidnapping the imam of Jibchit _ struggling <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and his two relatives _ and the ensuing repercussions and global reactions that cornered the criminal Zionists in an impasse, this entity has tried to cover up its terrorist act and big crime which violated the security and sovereignty of others and played havoc with international human ethics, values and norms `` So this entity launched what it called readiness to trade the -LRB- Israeli -RRB- prisoners of war and the -LRB- Western -RRB- hostages for <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners in the jails of Zionist occupation. `` It also returned today to propagate anew that negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in this regard were possible. `` We assert that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has nothing to do at all with the hostage issue or any negotiations related to this matter. This issue concerns the kidnappers only. Everybody knows this by now and knows the way to them -LRB- kidnappers -RRB- if they wanted to. `` Regarding the prisoners, any discussion is out of the question. The Zionist entity has to understand it has miscalculated and that the abduction of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> has blocked chances for a swap. `` Therefore, the Zionist enemy should free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> first and not promise itself and public opinion with what is impossible in light of the crime it has committed. `` We are very eager to release all the Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- in the prisons of the Zionist enemy, irrespective of their sects and affiliations because we consider that any prisoner with the Zionists belongs to the resistance. `` We are as eager to obtain the release of other detainees like <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaloum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Itaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON>, who belong to the uprising heroes, and <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaseen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON>, who belong to the heroes of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> resistance, as much as we are eager to obtain the release of the sons of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. `` What the enemy is trying to leak about the beginning of negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is a sheer, false and baseless rumor. It is a deceptive attempt to extricate itself from the great impasse in which it has fallen as a result of its latest foolishness whose consequences it did not foresee. It is also part of a wicked plan to frustrate the morale of the strugglers of the Islamic and nationalist resistance in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` Hezbollah.''

<HEAD>Inmates Killed at Desert Prison Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Palestinian prisoners at a desert detention camp were slain by other political detainees, the army said Saturday. It was not clear if the slayings were politically motivated. Palestinian inmates have killed several other detainees accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> camp, which holds Palestinians detained in connection with the uprising against Israeli control of the occupied territories. An army spokesman said the two bodies were discovered during a count of prisoners Saturday at the <ORGANIZATION> Ketziot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were killed by fellow inmates,'' the spokesman said. Arab and Israeli reporters said the new killings appeared to stem from a personal quarrel. The army said it was investigating. It identified the victims as 28-year-old Ziad Added <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Banna </PERSON> and 32-year-old <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesh </PERSON>, both from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Arab reporters said <PERSON> Banna </PERSON> was detained six months ago for hurling firebombs and that <PERSON> Jesh </PERSON> was accused of throwing stones. At least 88 Arabs accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities have been killed by other Arabs since the uprising began in December 1987. Army gunfire and Israeli settlers have killed 527 Palestinians, and <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> have killed 38 Israelis. The army said it imposed a curfew Saturday morning on the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp and the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Al-Sultan </LOCATION> neighborhood in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Arab reporters said troops in the two camps summoned all males between the ages of 15 and 50 to central areas for questioning. The reporters also said troops shot and wounded at least two people during disturbances in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Saturday. <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillal </PERSON>, 11, of the <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp, was treated at a hospital after a rubber bullet struck him above the left eye, and 23-year-old <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ateliah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> city was treated at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> hospital for a leg wound caused by a plastic bullet, the reporters said.

<HEAD>Both Sides in Angolan War Report Cease-fire Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government troops and U.S.-backed rebels accused each other Saturday of breaking a June 24 cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war, and confusion surrounded the future of talks aimed at ending the conflict. An Angolan armed forces statement said three rebel battalions attacked government soldiers in central <LOCATION> Bie </LOCATION> province. The statement did not mention casualties but said the rebels used South African-supplied artillery in the action. The <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> state news agency quoted military sources as saying 16 people died in other rebel attacks around the country. For the first time since the cease-fire, the army said it engaged rebel forces, claiming government soldiers killed two guerrillas who attacked barracks in northern <LOCATION> Kwanza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province, according to <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION>. A statement from the rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> accused the government of a number of attacks in central <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, including one in which a civilian was killed. Both sides repeatedly have accused each other of attacks since shortly after the truce, which was reached June 22 in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, between Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. The agreement charged Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> with mediating peace talks. The first round of negotiations between the warring sides, in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, were abandoned July 1 after <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> accused the rebels of breaking the truce. Resumed talks ended July 22 when rebel delegates asked for time to consult <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> in his southeast Angolan stronghold of <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>. The talks were to start again July 31. But they were postponed after 42 people died when a military transport plane was shot down. The government accused rebels of downing the plane. The rebels said the aircraft was hit by fire from government forces. Government sources on Tuesday said <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> would meet <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> for talks to put the peace process back on track, but no date has been announced.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Joginder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> grabbed a piece of shrapnel from a rocket that tore through his aunt's house Saturday, wounding his three young cousins, and demanded to know why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were allowing innocent Afghans to be hurt and killed. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s relatives and the two young children of a neighbor playing in the front yard were among the latest victims of the rocketing of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, an almost daily event since late June. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 13 rockets pounded the capital Saturday, wounding eight people. During and after his briefing, at least four more rockets fell, their distinctive boom heard across much of the city. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the rockets Saturday hit many areas but were concentrated around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s main grain silo, where several hundred trucks loaded with wheat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were waiting to be unloaded. The rockets missed the silo, but one tore into the ground about a yard in front of a watchtower on its perimeter, breaking the tower's windows and those of nearby houses. For the last four or five months, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said, U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government have been trying to starve this city by cutting roads and preventing food deliveries. `` Now that they ca n't cut the roads and all these supplies are coming to the city, their attack is to destroy what has already been delivered. It is their aim to impose starvation,'' he said. The <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> family house is about 1 -LCB- miles from the silo. The home's metal roof was torn off, and a rocket's path could be traced through two-foot-wide holes down to the ground floor. On the second floor, where <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said his 16-year-old cousin had been ironing, a pile of newly pressed sheets, stained with blood, lay in the rubble amid twisted fragments of shrapnel and the dusty iron. The windows in a primary school next to the two-story house were shattered. `` If the school had been open, God knows how many students would have been killed,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. The government has extended the summer holiday because of rocket attacks. `` We think this is a policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They are dividing the world ... and they are dividing Afghan brothers, the Afghan country,'' said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Afghan of Indian descent. `` If the government can not protect the people, they have no right to rule. And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, why are they doing this to innocent people? What have we done?,'' he asked. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources, 281 people were killed and 745 injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from June 25 to Aug. 1. Virtually all were civilians. A three-day lull last week was broken Friday when 19 rockets killed two people and injured nine, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors, have claimed responsibility for some rocketing but insist they aim at military targets and blame the government for hitting civilian targets. The government denies it. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> of not doing enough to stop `` gross violations'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of U.N.-mediated accords that were supposed to stop <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms supplies to the mujahedeen and Soviet arms supplies to the Afghan army. He welcomed <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s call Friday for a peaceful settlement of the 10-year-old civil war but said it was `` not enough.'' The Afghan government hopes <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will play `` a more active and more serious role than he has played so far,'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said, noting he has been authorized to visit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to try to end the war.

 A former <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> policeman who escaped from prison 12 years ago while doing time for murder was found in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he'd been living under an assumed name with a different wife and children, authorities said.

A neighbor said <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> seemed like a model father to the three children he adopted when he married <PERSON> Estela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> in 1978. `` You could n't think <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> would be capable of something like that.

Police were uncertain whether his wife knew of <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>'s past. `` She just could n't believe it when I called her. She asked me several times if I was lying,'' said detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> family has an unlisted telephone number in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> and his wife in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION> had five children, records show. It was unclear whether they remained married. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> police investigator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> had not made any effort to change his appearance, although he seemed to have aged well beyond his years while on the run.

Mexican officials say they hope the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Binational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will ratify the `` spirit of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'' and provide a platform for further progress.

The commission has not met for 2 -LCB- years, although meetings were supposed to be held every six months. Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials blamed the lapse on an political emphasis last year on presidential elections in both nations. Although relations between the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations are going well, similar honeymoon periods at the beginning of recent Mexican presidencies have ended in bitterness, recrimination and nationalist anger. `` In the past, we have sometimes had a dialogue of the deaf,'' said a top <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration official.

The participants will discuss `` everything from border bridges to the differences between our legal systems,'' said one Mexican official. The top issues will be continuing foreign debt negotiations and narcotics trafficking; other issues include immigration, trade and investment, pollution and tourism. The meeting comes only two weeks after <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reached agreement on reducing $ 53 billion of its debt to foreign banks. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials helped drive the bargain. Final details, however, still must be worked out. The deal got a mixed reception in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> declaring it a triumph and critics saying it did n't do enough. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is trying to revive an economy hurt by six years of austerity following the collapse of oil prices in 1982, and he has argued that debt reduction is the only way to provide capital for investment. He has liberalized trade laws and taken other steps to enourage investment and exports, not just from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but also from countries such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been pleased by many of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' actions, one said, `` They're not doing this to make us happy They're doing it because they think it will work.'' One remaining rub is patent law, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies complaining that Mexican companies copy their products without compensation. But even there, officials said, progress is being made. While <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> got help on the debt, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been effusive in their praise for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to combat drug trafficking. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has cracked down hard, arresting top traffickers and corrupt officials who had been untouchable for years. Mexican officials still argue, however, that the real problem is the demand for drugs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mexicans also criticize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude towards <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> immigrants, who they say are taking jobs Americans are unable or unwilling to fill. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has run some political risks in appearing to accommodate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on so many issues. Few Mexicans forget for long that half of what was once <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was conquered or bought by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is now an urban society and the 13th largest industrial nation in the world, the psychological problems of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condescension and Mexican sensitivity can still get in the way of normal relations.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> elected <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> president early Saturday and the left-leaning former vice president pledged to consolidate democracy and economic stability. In a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the congressional vote, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said, `` I wish to express my profound gratitude to the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> people who, abiding by the constitution, have expressed their will electing me president of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>.'' He was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because no candidate received a majority in a May election. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, 50, a sociologist and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social-Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, will be sworn in Sunday afternoon in the presence of five <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> heads of state, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, brother of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Outgoing President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, 82, will address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ending a half-century political career that includes four presidential terms. The new president, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>'s nephew, has said he will maintain a free-market economy and welcome foreign investments while giving special attention to improving the educational system and health care. He met with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> Thursday and said he is particularly interested in investments in the mining sector. In the May 7 presidential election, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> came in third with 19 percent. But in negotiations he gained the support of former dictator <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> who had finished second in the balloting. The support of <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> and his rightist party assured <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of victory in the congressional vote and he won with 98 of the 156 ballots. Under <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s Constitution, if no candidate wins a majority in the popular vote <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> elects the president by choosing from among the top threet vote getters in the general election. <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, the governing party's candidate, received the most votes in the May 7 election with 24 percent, but received only 49 votes in the congressional balloting. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>, a former general, won 23 percent of the vote in the general election. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also elected lawyer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjines </PERSON>, an ally of <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, vice president. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ossio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjines </PERSON> will serve four-year terms. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>, in forming the alliance, also agreed to form a coalition government. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will receive 10 Cabinet seats and <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s party seven. Their parties will share responsabilities in dealing with the economy and <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> will oversee a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that is to determine the government's overall policy. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> gained power in a coup in 1971 and ruled until 1978. In 1974, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> was accused of plotting to overthrow <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>'s government and he was jailed for six months and sent into exile <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>'s decision Wednesday to back <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> for the presidency surprised many Bolivians and led to a brief bank run with thousands of people forming long lines at banks to withdraw their deposits. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, once a Marxist, is considered now to be left-of-center with ties to <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, speaking to reporters upon his arrival Friday, said, `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looks forward to cooperating with the new Bolivian administration in the many bilateral and international issues that concern us.'' He said <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has made progress with its economic program `` which has become a model for other nations gripped by hyperinflation and crippled by economic instability.'' <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> inherits an economy that five years ago had an inflation rate of 24,000 percent but is now running at an annual rate of 6 percent. Sunday's swearing in ceremony will install <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 76th government since the country became independent from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1825. The inauguration will be the first time in 25 years that a government completed its term and relinquished power to a democratically elected successor.

 A stone coffin filled with gold jewelry was unearthed by archaeologists in the ancient Assyrian city of <LOCATION> Nimrud </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. It was the second discovery of a gold-laden burial in <LOCATION> Nimrud </LOCATION> this year. The agency quoted <PERSON> Muadad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s director of antiquities, as saying the find included `` hundreds of gold ornaments and pieces of jewelry.'' He said they were believed to belong to Queen <PERSON> Ninli </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmani </PERSON>, the wife of <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Assirnasurpal </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who ruled from 884-858 B.C. The coffin was found 13 feet below ground and tablets in wedge-shaped cuneiform writing also were associated with the royal burial, <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Nimrud </ORGANIZATION>, the military capital of the ancient Assyrian empire that stretched from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, is 25 miles south of the northern Iraqi city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>. In April, Iraqi archaeologists unearthed a stone chamber at <LOCATION> Nimrud </LOCATION> that contained the burials of two women accompanied by 55 pounds of gold jewelry.

The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial chamber. `` If anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I pray to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in the scorching sun after death ... Let the ghost of insomnia take hold of him for ever and ever,'' it said. The gold jewelery included necklaces, belts, brcelets, anklets and 50 pairs of earrings.

 Police fired tear gas into a church Saturday to disperse peaceful mourners at a post-funeral ceremony for two black activists killed in a bomb blast, a Roman Catholic priest said. The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said police used dozens of canisters of tear gas to break up the traditional post-funeral meal attended by about 500 people at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonteheuwel </LOCATION>, a mixed-race area outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` The people could n't get out of the church so they broke down the emergency doors and came into -LRB- an adjoining -RRB- house,'' <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said. `` Every time the people tried to go out, they were beaten back time and time again.'' Later, police fired tear gas on about 50 people trying to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest imprisoned activist, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, who turned 80 on Saturday. Police refused to allow the group into <ORGANIZATION> Groote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schuur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> receives treatment for diabetes. He was sentenced to five years' jail for terrorism in 1985. In the first incident, <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said police acted without provocation from mourners, who had come from a joint funeral for <ORGANIZATION> Coline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, 23, and <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterwitch </PERSON>, 20. Police said there were no arrests or serious injuries, but they refused to comment further. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Waterwitch </PERSON> died last month when a bomb they were planting in a public toilet exploded prematurely, according to police. Friends said the two supported the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which is fighting the South African government. `` One must not be surprised that in the end, young people begin to think that to plant bombs is the only way to bring change,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, at the funeral. There have been several bombings in the last two weeks as the country prepares for elections Sept. 6, which exclude the black majority. Under apartheid, South African blacks have no voice in national affairs. The white minority controls the government and economy. `` Thank you, <PERSON> Coline </PERSON>. Thank you, <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>. Thanks especially to you young people in your dedication to justice and peace, caring and humanity,'' said Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. About 5,000 people attended the funeral service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the mixed-race township of <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION>, singing freedom songs and waving the banned green, gold and black flag of the guerrilla organization Police confiscated flags draped over the two coffins. But additional flags were smuggled past them at the Maitland Cemetery and placed on the coffins just before the burial. The 5,000 mourners formed one of the largest crowds allowed at a funeral for black activists in the past two years.

 Army soldiers joined weary firefighters in hard-hit <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> on Saturday, working to save summer homes and thousands of acres of timber as forest fires sprang to life again with the return of warm weather. Weather also posed new worries in other parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as two days of relatively cool conditions gave way to new forecasts for rising temperatures, low humidity and lightning storms. `` We are bracing for some storms that could come in on Sunday,'' said <PERSON> Debie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chivers </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> -RRB- Interagency Fire Center, the national headquarters for fighting wildfires. At midday Saturday, 220,000 acres were burning nationwide and 1.4 million acres had burned so far this season, according to the center. The number of people fighting the latest spate of blazes, which broke out 1 -LCB- weeks ago when a rash of lightning storms raked the West, totaled 23,000. Nearly half the area affected by active fires this weekend was in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where blazes mushroomed from about 90,000 acres Friday to 102,000 acres Saturday. Large fires also persisted in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and smaller range and timberland blazes were being fought or mopped up in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> joined forces in a 1,200-acre `` burnout'' in <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> to save about 130 structures, including 70 summer cabins. Helicopters dropped flammable pellets to create a blackened buffer between a 21,800-acre complex of fires and the homes. In the northern part of the forest, a 4,200-acre fire lunged against fire lines created to protect the historic mining town of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>. `` We've had numerous spots jump over the line,'' <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Felmy </PERSON> said. `` They work on the spots as they appear, hitting them from the air and the ground.'' About 500 soldiers from the 4th Infantry `` Iron Horse'' group from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> joined firefighting crews in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> as support, and an additional 700 from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, were expected Monday. The <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> center has managed so far to get people and supplies where they are needed most. `` But if we get another bust -LRB- of lightning-caused fires -RRB-, things are going to be challenging,'' said another spokesman, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON>. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, firefighters expected to contain four large fires totaling 50,000 acres by the end of the weekend. However, a 10,300-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Hells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> was not expected to be contained until Tuesday, said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were able to get the upper hand,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` Now, the weather's getting warmer and dryer, and we can expect activity in these fires.'' More than 9,000 firefighters, including 1,300 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, were on fire lines in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, she said. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a 14,000-acre wildfire felled century-old timber and charred vegetation in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Fire officials said they had surrounded 40 percent of the week-old blaze straddling the <LOCATION> Riverside-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> line about 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but could n't predict when the fire would be contained. More than 2,000 firefighters struggled against constantly changing winds and high temperatures. The fire, however, is actually doing some good, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The blaze is consuming aging plants that have choked new forest growth, including dead trees infested with insects. `` Some of that area was so dense a person could n't walk through,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stager </PERSON>. The historic <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palomar </LOCATION> observatory and a sanctuary for bald eagles and spotted owls that was threatened earlier by the inferno were out of danger, firefighters said. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, firefighters contained a 60-acre brush fire just east of <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> on Saturday morning after a two-day struggle on the steep slopes of the <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. In south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a grassland fire on the Crow Indian Reservation leaped fire lines and burned about 2,000 acres of grassland overnight, but did not threaten any buildings, officials said. In northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, firefighters mopped up a blaze that consumed up to 3,000 acres of timbered canyon and forced the evacuation of 30 people earlier in the week. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, a small fire affected 45 acres Saturday in the <LOCATION> Bridger-Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> in the northwestern part of the state. Officials said they hoped to contain it by Monday.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rail workers in southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stopped trains for an hour Saturday in their latest bid to pressure the government for pay increases to counter triple-digit inflation. The rail stoppage came as new Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> met with economic and political specialists from the opposition Solidarity movement in an effort to assemble a Cabinet. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, now first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, conferred with party and army leaders Saturday, urging them to be proud of the party and defend it from `` demagogic attacks.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told the army officers meeting in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that in the past the armed forces served as `` a strong support of people's rule The situation is the same today and I believe it will continue in the future.'' The rail stoppage between noon and 1 p.m. affected domestic rail traffic in the <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region except for certain trains taking children to summer camps, according to reports in the official media and from the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. State television said about 80 trains were stopped. The strike was supported both by Solidarity and the official communist-allied trade unions. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Renda </PERSON>, leader of a strike committee in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, said rail workers now receive $ 60 a month in basic pay plus overtime and various differentials and bonuses. The workers want the basic pay increased to $ 96 a month along with cost-of-living adjustments recently approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Management is offering to raise the basic pay to $ 84, but that would include a cost-of-living adjustment that has not yet been computed, state television reported. The average monthly income in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is $ 127, according to government statistics. <PERSON> Renda </PERSON>, interviewed on state television, said, `` If our demands are not met, we expect the worse _ a general -LRB- railway -RRB- strike _ something that has never happened in the postwar period.'' Solidarity and the government media reported strikes by postal workers in <LOCATION> Legnica </LOCATION>, by workers at a tire factory in <LOCATION> Gruzdiaz </LOCATION> and by tram-car operators in <LOCATION> Walbrzych </LOCATION>. Strikes for higher pay have become common as the cost of living increases steadily. It is estimated the inflation rate for this year will exceed 120 percent. Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who was turned down Thursday when he asked Solidarity Sen. <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuratowska </PERSON> to join his government, continued meetings with Solidarity lawmakers. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> met Saturday with Solidarity Deputy <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugaj </PERSON> and opposition political theorists <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and Deputy <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>.

 A swimming pool that was off-limits to blacks for 34 years reopened Saturday to both blacks and whites following complaints by a church group. `` It's about time,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, a 34-year-old black man who stopped outside the <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swim </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on his way to a wedding. Few people showed up at the pool despite a temperature of 100 degrees. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> said he and a friend tried to obtain a pool membership three years ago, but were refused. `` I was told it was for white men,'' he recalled. Nothing was done at the time, although there were `` people here who knew it was wrong,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> said. The pool in this town 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was closed July 26 following publicity about the club's refusal July 13 to admit three black youths who were part of a church group that had arranged to use the pool. The land on which the club stands was deeded to the town in 1933 with the stipulation that it was for the use by the `` white children'' of the county and town of <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION>. The stipulation remained when the town sold the land to the <ORGANIZATION> Saluda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5 in 1955. The swim and tennis club rents the land from the <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> and enforced the rule. After the church group complained, the <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> ordered the pool closed until it was desegregated. A few black families purchased half-price memberships Saturday, but no one was waiting in line when the pool opened. About five black people swam, and about 50 cars stopped so occupants could get a glimpse. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibert </PERSON>, who is black, brought her two children and purchased a membership. `` I'm happy the kids will be able to swim,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sibert </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, about 28 miles from <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION>. Asked why she brought her children to the <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> pool, Mrs. <PERSON> Sibert </PERSON>, who works in <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION>, said, `` I think that's obvious. We were interested, and we came. `` I want my children to feel good about themselves and know they can swim where they want to,'' she said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, president of the pool's seven-member board of directors, said he was pleased that the pool opened under the desegregation policy. `` It's going well,'' he said. `` I feel like -LRB- blacks -RRB- will start coming to the pool.'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, 17, who is white, said they probably would n't. `` They think they're not wanted there,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, who was watching and said she was not a club member. She also said that the $ 80 seasonal membership fee to belong to the swim and tennis club _ which consists of a wading pool, the medium-sized swimming pool, and two cracked, overgrown tennis courts _ might be too expensive for many people in the mostly rural town of about 3,000 people. Several white high school youths who were sitting in their cars by the pool said they did n't want black people there. `` I do n't know why they want to come here,'' said one 16-year-old boy who would not give his name. `` I do n't care if it's discrimination I'm not going swimming with them.''

<HEAD>Judge Blasts HUD, Dallas in Public Housing Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge, in a ruling that lambasted city and federal housing officials, said <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> helped create a segregated public housing system and must help pay to dismantle it. In his ruling Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON> blasted the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the city and the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> for what he called a `` long, unbroken history'' of segregation in housing. <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON> accused the three of deliberately disrupting plans to correct the problem, and said he would appoint a special master to monitor compliance of a 1987 consent agreement handled in his court. `` The undisputed facts establish that the city was a substantial cause of deliberate racial segregation and discrimination in its public housing programs,'' <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON> said. His ruling added the city to the list of defendants in a 4-year-old desegregation case against the housing authority and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. He said he would rule later what financial share the city would assume. Seven black women sued in 1985, contending that thousands of federally assisted apartments in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> were segregated by race and unequal in conditions because of a longstanding pattern of discrimination by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and the city housing authority. The judge approved a settlement in January 1987 requiring demolition of most of the dilapidated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> housing project and relocation of tenants to private, rent-subsidized apartments throughout <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and the suburbs. Another part of his Friday ruling could have the effect of freeing up an estimated $ 3 million in federal funds for the demolitions. The funds were frozen by an amendment written by a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman to a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill. <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON> found that Mayor <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and other city officials have chosen to ignore the 1987 decree. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON>'s ruling would lead to improvements for thousands of poor families living in federally financed slums. `` It's the first time a city has been ordered to join with a housing authority to desegregate its housing,'' said attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>. `` And it's the first time a city has been ordered to fund the remedies for the separate and unequal conditions it helped create.'' `` It's fantastic,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dews </PERSON>, one of the plaintiffs in the case who has lived in subsidized housing for 20 years. `` There's a lot of people who say racism does n't exist in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, but this shows that it does,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, contacted Friday while vacationing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, would not comment on the ruling on the advice of the city attorney until the city council could be briefed. `` We have to hear what the attorney will recommend,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said. `` Until we know that, we do n't do anything.'' Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Postell </PERSON> declined to comment, as did attorneys for the housing authority and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON> ruled unconstitutional a 1988 amendment by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. It prohibits use of federal money for demolition of any of the nearly 3,500 apartments at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> project. Under the court-approved settlement, 839 apartments in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> project were to be renovated and the rest demolished. Residents could seek alternate, privately owned housing with federal rent-subsidy certificates. The cost of the demolition was estimated at $ 20,000 per unit. <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON> said the Frost Amendment was unconstitutional because it violated separation of powers. <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said he felt the housing should be renovated rather than razed.

 Between the baby bottle and the brown bag, there were lunch boxes. `` They were the first status symbols,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, 34, who has stirred the interest of baby boomers with a string of enterprises celebrating that old schoolyard standard in all its glorious incarnations. That Barbie doll box bought at the dime store for $ 3.49 back somewhere in the mid-1970s can fetch hundreds of dollars at auction these days. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> collects and resells them. The Beatles, the Jetsons, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howdy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doody </PERSON> and even yesteryear's teen idol, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, are also among the blue-chip boxes most highly prized by people generally between the age of 25 and 40, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. About 120 million lunch boxes were sold in their heyday between 1950 and 1970. So, according to <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>'s calculations, every baby boomer carried at least one, sometimes two, to school each year. `` By the end of the 1950s there were four competing lunchbox companies,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. `` Kids had a choice of models that reflected their personalities, sort of like an automobile showroom.'' Now lunch boxes are available only in plastic. The last steel version, featuring Rambo, was pressed in 1987, phasing out the metal models more than a decade after a mother whose son got struck in the head with one brought and won a lawsuit banning them in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> saw the ban coming. He knew it was only a matter of time before baby boomers in search of nostalgia created a demand.

 Fighting broke out among a crowd of thousands on this beach resort's mile-long boardwalk after a power outage left the area in darkness, authorities said. `` The lights flickered and everybody went crazy,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavin </PERSON>, manager of Lucky's Towels on the boardwalk. `` People started kicking down garbage cans, people were yelling and screaming and egging it on.'' People smashed windows, overturned garbage cans and began fighting after the lights went out around 1 a.m. Saturday, police said. About 25 people were arrested, most for misdemeanors such as fighting and disturbing the peace, said Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>. More than 200 police officers and 14 police dogs from 45 departments arrived on the scene, said Borough Police Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> LaStella </PERSON>. Police blocked the bridge leading to the island community and evacuated people from the boardwalk. `` There were kids running around throwing bottles, knocking over garbage cans and some attempted to steal some things from the stands,'' said <PERSON> LaStella </PERSON>. No injuries were reported, police said. Water and sewer service was maintained by back-up generators. `` The boardwalk was full and the nightclubs were full. It was n't rioting, it was fighting,'' said <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, who added that damage was minor Some people were stuck on amusement rides, but police helped them off, he said. Order was restored about 3 a.m., <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaStella </PERSON> said up to 25,000 people were on the boardwalk at the time of the power failure. Some merchants said the figure was closer to 6,000. Officials say the small community, which has a year-round population of about 2,100, swells to about 100,000 people on summer weekends.

 The National Women's Political Caucus will concentrate next year on electing abortion-rights candidates in key states across the nation, the group's leader said Saturday. The campaign, called `` Empower <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' will target races in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, caucus chairwoman <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said at the organization's annual convention. `` We are the pro-choice foot soldiers in the electoral trenches of this country,'' <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> told 1,200 delegates and guests. `` They say we have not yet proven that women vote as a bloc. Well, let me tell you, that is going to change.'' Actress <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also addressed the organization of female politicians. Outside, about 30 anti-abortion activists picketed for about two hours. `` We believe the majority of women around the country are not pro-choice,'' said protester <PERSON> Georgeann </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>. `` They are pro-life, and we are here to represent them.'' The campaign is a response to a recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing states to restrict abortions. <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said target states have legislatures that could swing in favor of abortion rights depending on the outcome of a small number of races. `` This is a pragmatic political plan that we know as pragmatic politicians will be effective,'' <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said. `` The times are tough for the women in this country, but we are tougher. We are not going to get mad. We are going to get even.'' `` The pro-choice issue is the winning issue because women are n't willing to go backward,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We are n't willing to go back to those back-alley abortions and to those coat hangers. Political consultant <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> told the convention that abortion-rights candidates must appeal to what he said was the majority of Americans who support a women's choice to have an abortion although they might disagree with it. <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said local abortion-rights groups will recruit and train legislative candidates. She had no estimate for the campaign's cost. Miss Shepherd, spokeswoman for a political action committee called Voters for Choice, said reproductive decisions should rest with the individual. `` It will be a test of our commitment and political will -LRB- as to -RRB- whether the same rights will be available to an unemployed women in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> housing project, the 16-year-old daughter of a coal miner in the hills of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> or a Native American woman living in the far reaches of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Their plight must be our fight.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told the group the caucus must convey the message that supporting reproductive rights is `` a good thing to do.'' `` Mainstream Republican voices have not been heard from loudly on this issue,'' she said. `` Maybe we should turn up the volume.'' At a news conference, former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said she expected the abortion issue to affect every political race in the country. `` The choice has to be left to women and it has to be a safe procedure,'' she said. `` I think that what this issue will do is mobilize people who care about human rights and civil rights.'' The four-day convention is scheduled to end Sunday. The caucus has about 77,000 members of all political affiliations, <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said.

 Space officials were confident Saturday as a veiled countdown began for launching the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday with five military astronauts and a secret spy satellite. It will be the first flight in 3 -LCB- years for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the oldest shuttle, which required more extensive overhaul than its two sister ships after the 1986 Challenger explosion. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> gave the go-ahead to start the countdown early Saturday even though workers were several hours behind schedule in completing routine work on the spaceship's engine compartment. Officials said later that the launch team was optimistic that all lagging work would be caught up by Sunday and that liftoff would occur as planned between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Pentagon will not let <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> disclose the status of the countdown or the exact launch time, citing national security reasons. Because the mission is classified, countdown displays normally available to the news media remained blank, and only members of the launch team and key <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials were supposed to know where the clock stood. The countdown will be made public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff. The five astronauts flew here Saturday from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to make final preparations for launch. Asked by a reporter if he had confidence in riding in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> after it had been grounded for so long, commander <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel, replied: `` Absolutely; you bet I do. I would n't fly it if I did n't ... I flew <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> a long time ago. It's a great machine.'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> piloted <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on a November 1983 trip. With him on the upcoming flight will be <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not disclose the nature of their mission. But sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that during four or five days in orbit they will deploy a large reconnaissance satellite and a smaller research payload and conduct experiments designed to define what role military astronauts can play in space. Once <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is in orbit, about nine minutes after liftoff, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will impose a blackout on all information about the flight, except for three brief announcements about the health of the spacecraft and the landing time. The silence will be broken only if there is a major problem. Defense officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships stationed off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already know a great deal about the mission and that once <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s satellite is in orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what it is doing This will be the 30th space shuttle flight and the fourth dedicated to a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> last was launched in January 1986, returning to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> just 10 days before the Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts. After the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> concentrated on modifying the newer orbiters, Discovery and <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>, before getting <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> ready. Discovery and Atlantis each flew twice since flights resumed last September after a 32-month hiatus.

Another staff member fields a caller searching for a fire officer called `` Joe Blow. `` Can you believe it?'' she says over her shoulder. `` He spells his name B-L-O-U-G-H.'' Others juggle as many as three of the constantly ringing phones, scanning computer terminals for personnel, airplanes, red chemical retardant and gear `` We drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique airplanes,'' declares the slogan on one T-shirt. In one leg of the L-shaped logistics room, the intelligence division keeps track of fires around the country. The other finds the crews and equipment to attack the flames. A big chalkboard plots the fires as they eat up mile after mile of fuel. Magnets resembling aircraft dot a map of the country, giving the location and type of equipment available. `` Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful,'' said Fire Center spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>. `` But the support people are dealing with human life facing fire, which is inherently dangerous.'' Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> backcountry for days after the last `` lightning bust.'' One storm laid down 2,000 strikes an hour with little rain. Then winds reaching 80 mph and temperatures pushing triple digits whipped those spots into major conflagrations. Three-inch-thick burning branches blew up to two miles ahead of the main fires. Flames swept over thousands of acres in several hours' time, creating a smoky miasma around <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s capital city. The buzz at the wildfire nerve center intensified dramatically. `` Fortunately we do n't work at this level all year,'' <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. `` It would be unbearable if we had to do this 365 days a year.'' The complex has taken on a military look. National Guard troops in camouflage fatigues march toward trucks for transportation to the fire lines. Smoke jumpers sit in the shade of a building waiting for their next leap into 100-foot-tall ponderosa pines, laden with chainsaws or water pumps. `` We are definitely an assault organization,'' <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. `` It's patterned after military operations because they work. We're the supply lines for the troops. In the logistics center, specialists spin Lazy Susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is answered. The requests are for airplanes, helicopters, axes and shovels, portable marine pumps, hoses, fresh fruit, disposable sleeping bags, soft drinks and, most important, manpower. World War II <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bombers _ PB-4Y2s and <ORGANIZATION> Neptunes </ORGANIZATION> _ are lined up on the flight deck, spattered with red retardant. They fill up again and again with thousands of gallons of `` slurry,'' a fertilizer-based substance that stops fires cold. Then the craft roar aloft toward the smoky mountains to the north. After five dry summers, backcountry timber has a moisture content only slightly higher than kiln-dried lumber, and strategists have settled in for a long campaign. It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires. Until then, the lights will be on at the Fire Center, and the pace will be frenetic. `` It's like <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, it's like an operating room,'' <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> says. `` Everybody knows it's stressful, but they're not snapping at each other. The key is cooperation.''

<HEAD>Opposition Wins Two of Three Seats in By-Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition candidates won two of three seats contested for Parliament in multiparty elections Saturday, state television reported. In the third by-election race, the required number of voters did not participate and another election will be held. Although only three of 387 parliamentary seats were contested, the poor showing by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was considered an indication of voter sentiment before national multiparty elections planned for June. Low voter turnouts and the failure of a candidate to win a majority in by-elections on July 5 led to Saturday's round. By law, a turnout of more than 50 percent is mandatory and the winner must receive a majority of the votes cast. Less than 50 percent of the eligible voters turned out for the election at <LOCATION> Kiskunfelegyhaza </LOCATION> and another round will have to be scheduled, state television reported. The two winners were <PERSON> Ernoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffay </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Debreceni </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION>. They were backed by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, an alliance of political groups opposed to the ruling Communists. <PERSON> Raffay </PERSON>, a historian, defeated <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON>, a bus company manager who was the candidate of the Communists' reform wing, and <PERSON> Levente </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobozy </PERSON>, an independent. <PERSON> Raffay </PERSON> received 61.8 percent of the votes, <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> 22.5 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Dobozy </ORGANIZATION> 16 percent. <PERSON> Debreceni </PERSON> ran unopposed after the Communist candidate and another rival dropped out following poor showings in the July 5 balloting. The evening newscast said <PERSON> Debreceni </PERSON> won 70 percent of the vote but did not account for the remaining 30 percent. The report said 57 percent of the electorate cast ballots in <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> but did not give the turnout in the two other races. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made campaign appearances last week to help the party's candidates _ with little success. At a rally in <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> Wednesday, party chairman <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said that although the elections would not determine the country's political future, they could not be ignored because they marked the beginning of a multiparty election system Lutheran clergyman <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON> won 69.2 percent of the votes in the July 5 by-election in <LOCATION> Goedoelloe </LOCATION>. He is considered to be the first opposition figure to be elected to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> since 1947, when the last completely free elections were held. Some non-communists won seats in 1985 under limited multiple-candidate elections but all candidates had to have the endorsement of the Communist-run <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will put a new 50,000-cordoba bill into circulation in an effort to keep up with steady devaluations and five-digit inflation that has forced some residents to carry bundles of money. Newspapers said Saturday that the new bill, worth about $ 2.50, will begin circulated Monday. The announcement comes less than four months after the government introduced the 20,000-cordoba note, the highest bill now in circulation. Since the beginning of the year, the cordoba has dropped from an official rate of 2,000 to the dollar to 20,000 to the dollar. The last devaluation was in June, when it fell from 9,500 to its current rate. Under a government austerity program this year, inflation has dropped from a rate of 20,000 for 1988. The rate for the month of July was 8.5 percent, according to official figures. However, prices on numerous basic products, including beans, cooking oil and soft drinks have increased substantially in the past few days.

<HEAD>Town Claims Hamburger Record With Patty for 10,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEYMOUR, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This farm town, which claims it invented the hamburger, fried up a 5,520-pound patty Saturday and served it to about 10,000 people in a bid for a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. `` It was nice and juicy,'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Witbrow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suamico </LOCATION>. The event at the <LOCATION> Outagamie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION> was a tribute to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Hamburger Charlie'' <PERSON> Nagreen </PERSON>, who _ according to local historians _ mashed a meatball to make the world's first hamburger in 1885. About 50 cooks in aprons worked around a specially designed grill 21 feet in diameter and heated by 12 gas burners. It took about two hours to cook the 6-inch-thick layer of ground chuck. To avoid having to flip the patty, grill designers <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON> used a cover to cook both sides at once. A truck-mounted crane lifted the cover into place and suspended <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON> over the patty as he sprinkled salt. The burger was intended to serve 15,000 people, but the meat ran out after an hour and 45 minutes and 10,000 diners. Five thousand buns were left over. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> plans to submit its claim to the biggest burger to publishers of the Guinness Book. According to the Guinness Book, the largest hamburger on record weighed 5,005 pounds, 13.8 ounces and was cooked in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, a town of 2,600 people 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, disputes claims by other communities, including <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to making the first burger. According to local lore, the 15-year-old <PERSON> Nagreen </PERSON> was selling meatballs from a booth at a fair when it occurred to him that people could carry them more easily if the meat were flattened between two slices of bread. The Appleton storekeeper died in 1951 after 65 years of hawking hamburgers at county fairs. The grill used to cook Saturday's giant hamburger was bigger than the patty, leaving space for a bigger attempt next year, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehne </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dressed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> donated the meat.

<HEAD>Candidate Says He's Determined to Revive Scandal-Plagued Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The race to be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prime minister started in earnest Saturday with front-running <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, joined by the two other candidates on television, saying he was `` young, energetic'' and determined to revive his scandal-plagued party. On Tuesday, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will elect a new leader to become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third prime minister this year. When the nominations deadline passed on Saturday, there were three candidates, none of them well-known or possessing a personal power base. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, is a former education minister whom analysts see as strongly leading because he is backed by large factions in the party. The other two candidates are <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, 62, a former welfare minister who called for more open politics, and <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, 56, a former transport minister who comes from the party's nationalist wing. One of them will replace Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who is resigning to take responsibility for the party's crushing defeat July 23 in elections for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> took office June 2, succeeding <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned in the Recruit bribery scandal that has tainted most of the leaders of the party. `` I am young, energetic and have power to act,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said in an 80-minute televised news conference at which the three candidates answered questions prepared in advance. They all said they favor party political reforms, continuing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ban on rice imports and reviewing the new 3 percent sales tax that was a major factor in the party's steep decline in popularity. They did not attack each other openly, instead often saying they shared the previous speaker's opinion. <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> came close to attacking the front-runner by saying the party's decision-making should become more `` easy to understand'' to win back the voters' trust. <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>'s candidacy emerged after it seemed there might be only one in the race _ <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, the nominee put forward by a combination of big factions. The party's 405 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and 47 local representatives vote in a secret ballot on Tuesday to elect a new president. The party leader will be confirmed as prime minister Wednesday on the strength of the Liberal Democrats' majority in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which chooses the head of government. But since the party lost its upper-house majority in the recent election, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> may face the embarrassment for the first time of a Socialist-led majority in the upper house refusing to endorse the winner from the lower house. While <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> said he was clear of any link to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate that is accused of trying to bribe politicians and others, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> has confirmed he received about $ 110,000 in legal donations from Recruit over five years. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> said Recruit had purchased $ 21,700 worth of tickets to symposiums he organized. The money was returned to Recruit after the scandal emerged, he said. Asked at the news conference about trade tension with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should reject unreasonable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands and blaming `` a lack of competitiveness in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products'' for the trade imbalance. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> also attacked the government for agreeing to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to revise the agreement on joint production of a new fighter plane for the Japanese air force. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could have built the fighter itself, <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> said: `` Why should we accept such a deal?''

 <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> halted for a moment of silence early Sunday to mark the 44th anniversary of the first atom bomb attack and to appeal for peace. As a single bell wailed and more than 1,000 doves were released into the skies, 50,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>'s Peace Memorial Park to mark the moment a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> B-29 bomber carried out the world's first atomic attack. At 8:15 a.m., the precise moment when the bomb exploded in a flash of blinding light on August 6, 1945, <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> citizens, Japanese government officials and visitors from throughout the world bowed their heads in silent prayer while buses and streetcars stood still throughout the city of 1 million. The heat, blast and radiation reduced to rubble and ashes a large portion of the western city, a major military center during World War II. About 140,000 people perished in the firestorm that engulfed the city. `` Our country, as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic attack, is determined that the tragedies of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> should never be repeated,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told the crowd, many of whom were dressed in black under a sweltering sun. `` We strongly feel the duty to use <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> to sound an alarm bell for the future of all humanity. From now on, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must carry out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and security in the world,'' said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who has announced he will resign the premiership. A group of visiting mayors, including <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, presented a large wreath of yellow chrysanthemums, the traditonal mourning flower, to the victims of the bombing at their official monument, a granite cenotaph in the center of the park. `` In my city we are learning that our strength as a nation does not depend on military might but on economic strength,'' <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> said after the ceremony. `` A nation's greatness is not measured by the evil it threatens but by the good it does.'' Outside the ceremony, hundreds of boy scouts handed visitors fresh flowers while protesters handed out leaflets criticizing alleged government laxity in preventing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships from bringing nuclear weapons into the country contrary to government policy. Korean residents of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> distributed pamphlets demanding the government apologize for its aggression against fellow Asians in World War II and other conflicts. At the memorial service, 4,244 names of those exposed to the bomb who died in the last year were added to the names enshrined on a tablet in the cenotaph. Although it is difficult to determine which deaths are directly related to the bomb, researchers believe the risk of death from leukemia, and lung, breast and bone cancer is greater for those exposed to the bomb than for those who were not. Three days after <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped a second atom bomb on the coastal city of <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, killing another 70,000 civilians. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945, ending the war.

 More than 1,800 sets of twins decided to double their pleasure Saturday by attending the 14th annual Twins Days Festival in this aptly named city. Organizers estimated that 50,000 people attended the first day of the two-day event. More twins were expected to arrive Sunday, with about 2,500 expected during the affair. Fifty-two contests were held to determine, among other things, the twins who traveled the farthest to attend, those who look most alike and least alike, and dozens of other attributes in various age groups. The same 52 contests were to be repeated Sunday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a letter to festival organizers that was reprinted in the program for the event. `` As grandparents of two beautiful children who are twins, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I know that everyone attending this festival has wonderful stories to share,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. `` We wish you a most enjoyable celebration.'' The festival was begun to honor <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who settled in what was then called <LOCATION> Millsville </LOCATION> in the early 1800s. The <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> brothers were lifetime business partners, married sisters, held all of their property in common and died of the same illness on the same day. In 1817, they asked that the town's name be changed to <LOCATION> Twinsburg </LOCATION>. In exchange, they donated six acres that now serve as <LOCATION> Twinsburg </LOCATION>'s town square, and gave $ 20 toward starting the town's first school

 A balloon deflated and plunged about 2,000 feet to the ground Saturday night at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balloon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Championships </ORGANIZATION>, killing its lone occupant as thousands of spectators watched. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Paonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, died at Our Lady of the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about an hour after the 5:55 p.m. accident, said a nursing supervisor who refused to give her name. The cause of the accident was not known, but witnesses said <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>'s balloon suddenly deflated, burst into flames and plunged to the ground. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Birk </PERSON> of Defiance, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, director of the championships, denied eyewitness reports that <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>'s balloon _ the <ORGANIZATION> Chariot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION>, Too _ caught fire after deflating. He said people on the ground might have mistaken flames from the balloon's burner for accident-related flames. `` It is apparent that the burner was operated by the pilot until he was about 75 feet above the ground,'' <PERSON> Birk </PERSON> said. Mock apparently turned the burner off at that point to prevent a fire on impact, he said. Mock told his ground crew by radio that the flaps on his balloon were loose, and he apparently tried to compensate by pumping more hot air into the balloon, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> sheriff's Capt <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorter </PERSON>. `` At that point, the balloon collapsed and he plunged approximately 2,000 feet,'' Shorter said. About 45 balloons were in the air at the time, <PERSON> Birk </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were investigating the accident. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tightly regulates the sport and inspects balloons annually or after each 100 hours of operation, just as the federal agency checks conventional aircraft, <PERSON> Birk </PERSON> said. Parachutes are n't required and a fire extinguisher is the only safety equipment carried in gondolas. `` At many times, there is little the pilot can do to retard a fall,'' he said. Documents showed <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>'s last in-flight certification was April 2, 1988, and his balloon was last inspected on Dec. 1, 1988. <PERSON> Birk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>'s balloon had been deemed airworthy. Up to 10,000 people may have seen the accident at the <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION>, Shorter said. Saturday was the second day of the gathering of hot-air balloonists. The championships end Aug. 13. It was the first fatal accident in the national championships' 19-year history, <PERSON> Birk </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A three-judge federal panel has refused to stop the establishment of a single governing board for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 17 colleges, the key part of a court-ordered desegregation plan. `` It is high time that higher education in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> be reworked at all levels in a unified effort to improve the education offered in this state to all <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> citizens,'' the court said Friday in an opinion issued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The panel last month ordered <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to replace four governing boards with one in a package of sweeping reforms to desegragate the state's 17 public colleges and universities. The judges ruled the present system `` has perpetuated illegal segregation.'' The ruling came in a lawsuit filed 15 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Currently, one board governs the <ORGANIZATION> Lousiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system, another governs the mostly black <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system and a third governs the others. All three boards answer to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> for Higher Education. State Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guste </PERSON>, who had asked to court to overturn its decision mandating the single board, said he would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In a motion filed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Guste </PERSON> said the state Constitution calls for four governing boards and the federal court `` ca n't change the state constitution unless it is patently unconstitutional.'' The new board has been ordered to restructure the higher education system beginning Aug. 18. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has appointed the board's 17 members, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin Aug. 14. The court on Friday also rejected a request by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to put in the ruling specific amounts the state must spend to improve programs at predominantly black Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>.

 An Afghan guerrilla leader said Saturday his fighters killed 11 members of a rival guerrilla organization and captured 30 during a battle in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Islam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, made the comment at a news conference. His version disputed reports by the rival <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> that five of its members were killed and 25 were captured and then slain on July 9. It was <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s first public appearance since the fight between the rival guerrilla factions. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoib </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, said July 18 that <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s followers killed five <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> members in the July 9 ambush and killed 25 who were taken prisoners. He said among the dead were seven Party of Islam field commanders. Other rebel sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Islam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> were engaged in a power struggle that hindered efforts to overthrow <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed Marxist government. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, responding to the July 9 killings, said it deplored the action but its support to the Afghan rebels would continue. <PERSON> Qaribur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s guerrillas, said at the time that some <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas had been killed in the battle but denied the reports of killings afterward. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said Saturday that 11 Party of Islam guerrillas were killed while 30 were seized and `` are being held captive and are still alive.'' He did not give conditions for their release. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said his fighters ambushed the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas because they had repeatedly attacked his local headquarters in northern <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> province. He called the battle a `` local, regional conflict'' and not a war between the two parties. Party of Islam leader <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s faction should be suspended from an `` interim'' government proclaimed by seven rebel factions based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s group has received a major portion of millions of dollars worth of military aid supplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, who holds the title of foreign minister in the 6-month-old interim government, indicated he would boycott the alliance if elections are n't held by Aug. 10. He said elections throughout war-ravaged <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in refugee camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were essential to stop internal fighting among the rebel factions. `` It -LRB- elections -RRB- would kill the tendency toward armed clashes,'' he said. `` This is the only way of putting an end to our problems.'' Guerrilla leaders formed the interim government during a series of meetings in February in the Pakistani capital of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> joined with the condition that it hold elections within six months. `` Elections would include other parties, provide a legitimate body to draw up a constitution, dispense with tribal prejudices and prevent internal fighting,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said through an interpreter. He called on Afghan army units to stage a coup with the rebels' help and set up a `` revolutionary council'' to oversee nationwide elections It appeared that <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> made the proposals to try to counter growing criticism. He and his party have been accused by other rebel groups of seeking to dominate the alliance. Marxist army officers seized power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a 1978 coup. The Soviets ended more than nine years of military intervention to help the government when it completed the withdrawal of troops on Feb. 15. The Kremlin continues to back the government with military and economic aid.

Women will not return `` to a form of enslavement'' caused by making abortion illegal, <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> <PERSON> Hames </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney who handles abortion-related matters, said during a panel discussion of abortion at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention. <PERSON> Hames </PERSON> said groups around the country are working to mobilize the 25 million women who have had legal abortions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A standing-room-only crowd of about 150 people, mostly women, attended the debate by four attorneys, two <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> legislators, a journalist and a historian.

 Flooding washed away a house, forced the evacuation of a trailer park and closed roads in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on Saturday as thunderstorm winds up to 85 mph downed trees, power lines and telephone service in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Lightning killed an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> man north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, and a falling tree injured a child after a funnel cloud reportedly touched down briefly 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, on Saturday night, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> searched <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for a stranded boat believed to have two people aboard. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, severe thunderstorms packing winds up to 70 mph tore the roofs off buildings in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. The storms appeared to be the remnants of Hurricane Chantal, which washed ashore in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> last week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. An overnight storm dumped up to 5 inches of rain on parts of central <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, was the worst hit. One home was washed away by the rising <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. Several stretches of road connecting <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION> and the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> remained flooded, state Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngbaer </PERSON> said at an emergency town meeting. `` There are several families in there, who are isolated between washouts,'' he said. `` One of the priorities is to figure out a way to get emergency vehicles in there if they're needed.'' <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION> sits astride the confluence of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Yards along the brook were 6 inches deep in silt and were strewn with debris, residents said. At the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Run </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trailer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> tributary, overflowed its banks. Dozens of residents were forced to flee waist-deep water, state police said. The river receded by noon and residents returned to their homes. Main Street in nearby <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> was 6 to 8 inches deep in water for a time, and several businesses' basements were flooded. A car was seen up to its door handles in water. Roads were washed out or closed by mudslides in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>, Moretown and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>. A musician at King's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> amusement park north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> was struck by lightning about 6 p.m. as he made his way to his car during a thunderstorm, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mefford </PERSON>, manager of marketing communications for King's Island. The victim, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahall </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was a member of a Dixieland band hired to entertain guests at the amusement park, <PERSON> Mefford </PERSON> said. Another man, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Blosser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>, was struck by lightning while in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, fire officials said. <PERSON> Blosser </PERSON> was listed in extremely critical condition at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. A church in the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> was heavily damaged in a three-alarm fire that started as the thunderstorm began, and a portion of the roof of an apartment building in nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitchell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was blown off by high winds, officials said. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, residents reported a funnel cloud, said <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>. `` We've got trees and power lines down virtually all over the place,'' <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> said. The extent of the child's injuries was not known. In addition to the homes reported damaged by high winds, several fires, probably electrical, were reported, <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> said. None of the fires appeared to be serious. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, severe thunderstorms packed winds up to 85 mph, pelting cities and farm fields with hail and leaving a trail of broken trees, damaged buildings and power outages that affected more than 15,000 customers. In western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, about two-thirds of an inch of rain were accompanied by winds that stripped leaves from corn stalks, blew down part of a barn and knocked down tree limbs near <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION>. `` Clouds came in rolling over each other, the sky turned black, the wind came up and the garbage cans took off,'' said <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, a convenience store clerk in the central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Boone </LOCATION>. Winds hit 75 mph in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where powerful thunderstorms knocked out electrical power to about 15,000 residents and stranded the boaters. The overnight storms flooded many streets and caused problems on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> belives the missing 18-foot boat might have been blown out on the lake. Winds as high 75 mph were reported in surburban <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> on Friday night. Thunderstorms and high winds did similar damage in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Journalists from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended a conference by stressing the need for more `` citizen diplomacy'' between the superpowers. `` Twenty bridges are better than one,'' <PERSON> Nickolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Reimers </PERSON>, editor of Science and <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said on the last day of the five-day conference Friday. `` If we paired people up by interests, paired up the exchanges, it would be a new step,'' <PERSON> Reimers </PERSON> said through a translator. The conference at <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> and the Union of Soviet Journalists, brought together nine Soviet journalists and nine from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We need more depth of exchange,'' said <PERSON> Viachislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohvalski </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Zaporozhskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` It is part of a citizens' diplomacy, which is more important than the official diplomacy.'' <PERSON> Reimers </PERSON> said he would like to see the two organizations set up permanent teams of journalists to work together on stories and projects all over the world. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, editor of the Central Maine Morning Sentinel in <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>, said he corresponds with a Soviet newspaper editor, and the two papers exchange news stories and columns, but have not been able to arrange a visit. He agreed it would be a major step forward if individual exchanges could take place. <PERSON> Sergey </PERSON> <PERSON> Runov </PERSON>, a member of the board of the Union of Soviet Journalists, said the two groups could hold joint seminars and lectures and swap journalists. Such an exchange, he said, would allow people could learn the truth about each nation, not just the propaganda. Even without exchanges, the groups have made progress in thawing Soviet-American relations, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Caughey </PERSON>, an editor at the Patriot Ledger in <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` We have a saying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Caughey </PERSON> said. `` It is better to light one little candle than to curse the darkness. We've been at this a long while I'd like to think we lit a few of those candles, and you in return lit candles. It has been worth the effort.'' Journalists from both nations discovered they had similar problems in trying to obtain information for stories. One Soviet journalist said not everyone welcomes perestroika, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program, and said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media has been criticized for playing a large part in opening the government up to examination and question. <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, an editorial writer with The Day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the most valuable aspect of the conference was meeting Soviet counterparts. `` All the stereotypes I grew up with are meaningless when you look into a person's eyes,'' she said.

 Negotiators for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have endorsed agreements permitting visa-free travel for natives of northwest <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chukotsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> The agreement reached Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will become official when it is signed by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, possibly as early as September, said an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. The agreement also establishes a commission of three Soviets and three Alaskans to help deal with minor incidents, emergency evacuations and search and rescue operations, said <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavora </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said the agreement is the most significant development yet in a 2-year-old thaw between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> territories across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, natives who live on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> Kotzebue </LOCATION> area and have cultural or family ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are expected to qualify for visa-free travel, <PERSON> Gavora </PERSON> said. Trips could last up to 90 days. The federal government would determine who could go and would compile lists to be placed at border checkpoints. Travel would be confined to border regions. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives used to travel across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> by motorboat to exchange walrus skins and sable fur. They returned with flour, sugar, tobacco and underwear from Soviet trading posts. The agreement permitting the trips was terminated in 1948 as the Cold War chilled relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. With the easing of border tensions in the past two years, Soviet and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yupiks </LOCATION> have renewed contacts.

 Parents whose young son apparently suffered brain damage after taking aspirin six years ago on Friday lost their $ 50 million lawsuit against two drug companies and two distributors. A Superior Court jury said the apparent injury to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Bunch Jr. could not be linked to aspirin he took in 1983 at age 9 when he had chicken pox. Shortly after taking the aspirin, the boy became seriously ill and slipped into a coma. He regained consciousness, but apparently suffered brain damage, according to medical testimony in the monthlong trial. Parents <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aspirin </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sundry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures a generic aspirin; and distributors <ORGANIZATION> Whitworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Norwich-Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>. The parents' attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he had n't decided whether to appeal the decision. <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome, which causes liver and brain inflammation, has been linked to aspirin. Defense attorneys argued successfully that the boy suffered from hepatitis or encephalitis not caused by aspirin.

 Open with a shot of the sun setting on a steamy <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town. Cut to a smoke-filled room. A ceiling fan turns slowly as corrupt cops, officials on the take and greedy politicians discuss shakedowns, kickbacks and under-the-table deals. As a B-grade movie it might play, but <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials say it is n't reality. They believe they've cleaned up whatever image problems the state's film industry had as a result of last year's indictments of two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police officers, an employment office worker and the former director of the state film commission. `` Filmmaking is big business and it's a growing business in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, but there was no doubt that the state had an image problem for a while,'' said <PERSON> Tisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Laviolette </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Those indicted were accused of funneling jobs to a favored few when movies, TV shows or commercials were made in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. When the stories hit the trade publications in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, they did not go unnoticed, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Neter </PERSON>, unit manager for one major movie shot in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` Sure, people talked about it,'' he said. `` It was the only incident of that kind I ever heard of. The situation was dealt with, though. I think the fact that the state brought the people to trial showed that they wo n't allow that sort of thing.'' The indictments came after shooting the hit <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON> movie, `` The Big Easy,'' which was ironically about police corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. There were two acquittals and one conviction in 1988, and numerous cases were put on hold, with no trial dates likely to be set. Since then, moviemaking moved ahead full steam in the state. In the last year, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> and a horde of machine-gun carrying gangsters took over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> streets in the prohibition-era `` Millers Crossing.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> portrayed former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and cavorted with a stripper in the movie `` Blaze.'' And `` The Blob'' oozed its way through the little town of <LOCATION> Abbeville </LOCATION> for a remake. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, the producer of `` Blaze,'' admitted to being a bit leery of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s reputation before coming to the state. `` We had heard that some of the film commissioners had been indicted and the teamsters in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have always had a tough reputation,'' he said. `` I had some doubts about what we would be asked for or if people were going to want something slipped to them under the table. We have n't come across anything like that, however. The new film commission is working to make sure no one gets that impression of the state from now on.'' `` <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s Crossing,'' `` The Blob'' and `` Blaze'' poured $ 128 million into the depressed <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> economy in 1988, <PERSON> Laviolette </PERSON> said. `` Out of that amount, I'd say there was $ 40 million in cold hard cash left behind in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. A very conservative estimate is that it has an economic impact of $ 120 million by the time it turns over in the community, and I think we could double that figure.'' The slogan of the commission is `` Shoot the other LA,'' and people are listening, she said. `` In the last few years, filmmaking in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has really gone up. We normally averaged seven films a year shot here. In 1988 we did 14 and 1989 looks equally promising.'' Even though 42 states have film offices and actively compete for business, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> remains the film leader of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> close at its heels. Though not always cheaper, it's easier to make a movie outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. One-stop, state-controlled film offices are preferred to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s patchwork approach, where local governments issue permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70 years old. And the long-held belief that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> could recreate anything from the Tara plantation in `` Gone With the Wind'' to the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in `` One From the Heart'' has been abandoned by filmmakers who want greater realism. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> lures film companies with locations that include the French Quarter, swamps, plantation homes and small-towns. `` We have the architectural styles we needed within a very tight radius,'' said <PERSON> Neter </PERSON>, unit manager on `` <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s Crossing.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>, who directed and produced `` <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s Crossing,'' considered <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as settings before choosing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> `` The film is set in 1929,'' <PERSON> Neter </PERSON> said. `` It's not specified as taking place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; it's an unidentified city. We wanted that look, though, the architecture and ambiance of the time, and we found it here. We've shot all over town, I'd say 30 locations, and it's been great.'' Another consideration for choosing <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was to have a location where they could shoot in the winter and not have snow. `` It's worked out absolutely great,'' <PERSON> Neter </PERSON> said. `` For a film crew that has to be away from home for three to six months, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> certainly offers a lot in cultural and epicurean opportunities that make your off hours more enjoyable.'' `` We like to think of it as one-stop shopping for filmmakers,'' said <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbo </PERSON>, who acts as liaison between the city agencies and filmmakers. `` We try to meet the needs of the people filming and minimize the problems it will cause local residents.'' <PERSON> Laviolette </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> is beginning to get repeat performances _ filmmakers returning to make other movies. `` I think it is because of the positive experience they have working in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> as well as the other things we offer,'' she said. Despite budget problems plaguing the governor and the legislature, <PERSON> Laviolette </PERSON> plans to ask for a $ 49,000 increase to build an aggressive advertising campaign. `` There are a lot of commercials, movies and television productions shot outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. I want more of them shot in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` People here are not only enamored with the movies, they're beginning to realize what big business it is.''

<HEAD>Defining The Recession Animal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The summer pastime of economists and others who try to anticipate the future is whether the economy is headed for a soft landing, a recession or neither. Opinions are as varied as the grains of sand on the beach or the shape of the clouds or the bubbles in a drink, and for the practical purposes of most ordinary people it matters not a whit who is right. Recessions come and go. No free-market economy has ever been without them for long. They are an economic pulse, preceding and following expansions. They are in the nature of free-market economies, like colds are to humans. They might come from unexpected events, such as catastrophes or shortages; or from economic mismanagement, such as misinformed money-supply policies; or simply because when times are good people push things to the extreme. Whether a recession technically occurs is n't of vast importance to most people. More significant by far is the extent of the downturn in terms of jobs and job security, wages, profits and prices. Technically, a recession occurs when gross national product declines for two successive quarters. But it is possible for this to occur without being noticed by the ordinary working person or, in fact, by entire geographic areas. Consider: It is a slowdown, not a recession, if economic expansion slows but grows by a fraction of 1 percent for two successive quarters, but it is a recession if the economy shrinks by a fraction for two quarters in a row. Other criteria are considered too, but past recessions usually have been identified by the two-quarter theory. Especially important to the ordinary person is the length of a recession or a slowdown. Some are V-shaped; the decline is quickly followed by an upturn. Some are U-shaped. And some are long and level as a summer horizon. Is a quick, corrective recession any worse than a prolonged downturn that does n't qualify as a recession? Stagnant economies that stumble along the plus side of the recession-expansion line might be more destructive. There's a geographical aspect to recessions too. Technically, the nation's economy can be described as in recession with some regions enjoying good times. Or, the numbers can show it to be healthy when many areas are desperately ill. The latter, in fact, occurred earlier this decade when states dependent on oil, mining and agriculture simultaneously suffered economic woes for different reasons. At one time in that period an economic research organization, <ORGANIZATION> Sindlinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, measured 33 states in recession. Offsetting their depressing effect on the national statistics were coastal areas with expanding economies. There is also some evidence that recessions today need not be quite what they used to be, due in part, perhaps, to more informed economic management and maybe to the emergence of a global economy. If the domestic consumer economy is weak, for example, it might be offset by exports to a strong foreign economy. Some economists like to refer to `` rolling readjustments'' rather than recessions. The term is euphemistic to some extent, but the rationale may be sound. Moreover, it seems to be supported by some recent experiences. Whatever, these economists believe it is less likely today than yesterday for most industries to go down together, and more likely that a recession will roll through the economy, affecting different industries at different times. Recessions can be all-inclusive or selective. They can be extended or brief. They can be deep or marginal. They can be accompanied by price increases or decreases. They can be significant or relatively unimportant. Not all of the species is savage. While you might not like to make a pet of any recession, some of them are quite tame.

<HEAD>Bass Bolstered Future Prospects by Going Back to Basics</HEAD>

 When G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s former corporate parent finally found a buyer for its shoe manufacturer in 1987, prospects for Bass looked so bleak that the new owner got a bargain. Today, the 113-year-old Bass is winning back a following after rescuing its reputation for quality and updating its traditional styles. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> was on the block when the British-Dutch consumer products giant <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Chesebrough-Pond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had owned <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> since 1978. No eager buyers rushed forward because the American footwear industry was being crushed by foreign competition and <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> looked like it lacked the market toehold to wage a successful fight. `` Bass had done nothing but struggle from 1983 to 1987,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorbeck </PERSON>, the current Bass president. `` During this time, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> was a prominent example of how a domestic manufacturer was under great pressure, and at the same time was dealing with its own misdirection and mismanagement.'' American shoe manufacturers in the early 1980s had to adjust to radically changing American tastes in shoes while coping with an influx of imports. Orderly marketing agreements with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> controlling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of non-rubber footwear _ meaning virtually all types of shoes _ were allowed to expire under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. At the time, the two countries were major foreign suppliers of everything from tennis sneakers to dressy pumps. Imports surged. By 1986, imported leather and plastic shoes had expanded to about 1 billion pairs from 520 million in 1981, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangione </PERSON>, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The supply went to satisfy a burgeoning demand for athletic shoes; the jogging craze evolved into the aerobics fad, both of which were part of a bigger fitness movement that has influenced consumers' shoe selections ever since. `` The driving factor in the footwear market in this country is fashion and the athletic trend drove this market for the last decade,'' says <PERSON> Mangione </PERSON>. In such an environment, a company like <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> known for conservative, sturdy leather lace-ups and loafers was n't where it was at. `` Nobody was crazy about traditional Bass Weejuns,'' <PERSON> Thorbeck </PERSON> says of the shoe, named for its Norwegian inspiration, that debuted in 1936. `` These were the years when <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> were becoming billion-dollar companies. The casual shoes were being swept aside by the <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> hurricanes.'' During those troubling years for Bass, which had been a private, family-owned business for most of its history, the firm branched out in directions that turned out to be the wrong ones. It introduced <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a line of athletic shoes that flopped. It imported a line of women's shoes from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the quality was so poor that every retailer returned its shipments to Bass. It neglected to advertise or place marketing emphasis on its hand-sewn leather moccasins and other shoes. With cost-cutting in mind, it allowed quality to slip. Most of Bass's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories were shuttered, leaving only one in <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and one in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The company lost $ 46 million on sales of $ 150 million in 1986. The next year <PERSON> Phillips-Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heusen </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, famous for making and marketing women's and men's apparel, particularly shirts, bought <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, Maine-based Bass for $ 79 million, well under its book value of $ 130 million. Thorbeck, formerly with shoe company <ORGANIZATION> Timberland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, says when he was brought in by <PERSON> Phillips-Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heusen </PERSON> in November 1987 he felt <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> needed to reassert its identity after mistakenly ignoring its own strengths for too long. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> decided to win back affluent consumers, those willing to pay around $ 100 for a pair of loafers. It took a targeted advertising approach and placed 12-page promotional pitches in the upscale magazines Vogue and GQ. Some early successes under the new ownership helped restore the company's confidence. Contemporary versions of some of <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s old favorites appealed to retailers, who probably were looking for shoe lines to satisfy nostalgia-mad grown-up baby boomers. Saddle shoes and buckskins were enjoying renewed popularity within some yuppie circles `` In one season we proved ourselves as traditional yet contemporary,'' says <PERSON> Thorbeck </PERSON>. `` We were hitting on all cylinders by the fall of 1988.'' Some of <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s recent updating touches have proved timely. The company capitalized on the demand for so-called status sneakers this spring by bringing out a version of the canvas, rubber-soled shoe swith brass eyelets, leather-padded trim and leather laces. Instead of selling a projected 30,000 pairs in the first year, <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> now thinks it will sell 400,000 pairs. Bass has concentrated on a relatively small selection of retailers, including department stores <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nordstrom </ORGANIZATION>. It does n't sell to discounters at all and controls the markdowns on its merchandise by offering reduced-price shoes at outlets. These Bass-owned stores are carefully located in areas with numerous factory outlets that attract bargain-hunting tourists. Bass has returned to profitability. It earned $ 16 million in 1988 on sales of $ 180 million and expects to report significantly better results for 1989. A Bass catalog has been brought out, with clothing to complement the shoes. <PERSON> Thorbeck </PERSON> says he's pleased with the prominence retailers are giving Bass in their shoe departments. <PERSON> Phillips-Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heusen </PERSON> has given Bass management leeway to develop its own strategy. `` One of the advantages of a company that was in this poor shape was we could sweep through changes without much hesitation,'' says <PERSON> Thorbeck </PERSON>. `` We went back to what we knew best and we reinterpreted it for a contemporary customer.''

<HEAD>Junk Bond Market Prepares For Fallout From S&amp;L Order to Divest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The junk bond market is preparing for the fallout from a requirement that savings and loans sell their holdings in these high-yield, high risk investments as part of the congressional thrift bailout bill. Some industry watchers say the elimination of savings and loans as a market for junk bonds could depress junk bond prices and make it more expensive for companies to float new high-yield issues. `` It is a significant pool of capital that has now been cut off from the high-yield market. Of course that's going to restrict any market,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group for junk bond issuers. Others say the ban on thrift junk bond holding may not have a major impact. `` While thrifts are important junk bond investors, they do n't comprise an enormous percentage of buying power,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriz </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Kriz </PERSON> said other factors affecting the junk bond market at the time the thrifts sell their holdings may mitigate the effect of the sales. Among these factors are interest rates and how many new junk bond issues are floated. Other industry watchers say it's premature to say what effect the bailout bill's provision would have. The provision was approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel late last month. It would give thrifts five years to sell their junk bond holdings, so there probably would n't be a wholesale dumping of the bonds at once. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the thrift industry's largest trade group, said it did not lobby against the junk bond requirement because only about 175 of the nation's 2,900 savings and loans invest in the bonds Of the 175, 10 held about 70 percent of the $ 4.1 billion in junk bonds owned by the industry in the first quarter, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grohl </PERSON>, a senior vice president for the trade group. The Alliance for Capital Access put the total junk bond investment by thrifts at about $ 14 billion. Whichever figure is correct, the investment is still a small fraction of the approximately $ 200 billion junk bond market. The Alliance's <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> says the loss of thrifts as junk bond buyers would be especially troubling because it has been a fast-growing market for the bonds. Thrift investments in junk bonds have doubled since 1985, he said. But, he added, there are other juicy markets for junk bonds that have barely been penetrated, such as the life insurance and mutual fund industries. Of the approximately $ 1 trillion in assets of life insurers, less than 1 percent is invested in high-yield securities. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said the ban on thrift junk bond holdings may have a psychological impact on the market, forcing junk bond issuers to increase the yields of the bonds, which already are substantially higher than <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. But <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he expected the impact would be temporary. The savings and loan legislation provides a loophole for thrifts that want to keep their junk bonds. Under the bill, they may form a separately capitalized affiliate and sell their junk bonds to it. But <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said few thrifts would have the financial wherewithal to set up such a subsidiary. Junk bonds are so named because they are rated as non-investment grade, or speculative, by the credit rating firms. Because of the higher risk of default, they pay more interest to holders than investment-grade bonds. Junk bonds are issued by companies that already are deep in debt or otherwise can not obtain an investment-grade rating. They also are used to raise cash for corporate takeovers. The Alliance for Capital Access stands by the soundness of junk bonds as investments. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he believes the divestment provision of the bailout bill was motivated in part because the bonds are used for hostile takeovers and because thrifts were using federally insured deposits to invest in them. `` The debate was driven by emotion, not facts,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The pioneer and biggest booster of the junk bond market, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also opposes the divestiture requirement. `` No thrift has ever failed because of their investment in high yield bonds,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>. `` We feel this action will only serve to restrict access to capital by small and medium-size businesses.''

<HEAD>Stocks Shrug Off Recession Talk</HEAD>

 Talk of a possible recession may frighten politicians and business planners, but it does n't seem to scare investors in the stock market these days. The word came up with increasing frequency this past week when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its index of leading economic indicators had declined for the fourth time in the last five months. After more than 6 -LCB- years of expansion, many analysts said, the chances looked increasingly high that business activity was headed into a slump. Yet stock prices held their ground at or near record highs, after finishing off July with one of their strongest monthly gains ever. `` Historically, the leading economic indicators have peaked four to six months before the economy has turned down,'' observed <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhirud </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Stock prices typically have peaked four to six months before the leading economic indicators turned down. `` So what's happening this time around? Stock prices should have peaked about six months ago but have n't, making for considerable confusion among strategists and economists alike.'' That is n't the only disparity giving forecasters fits. Unlike stock market investors, bond traders lately have been behaving as though a recession were very close at hand. Before they suffered a setback on Friday, bond prices had risen dramatically in recent weeks, pushing interest rates downward in apparent anticipation of slack credit demand and a business slump. Despite all that, however, optimists on the economic and financial outlook argue that it is unwise to try to argue with the stock market. `` We suspect that when the last 21 months take their place in the history books, it will be under the title ` What Did n't Happen,''' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnaruma </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We did not have a recession, the dollar did n't go to parity with the yen, inflation did n't go to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and stocks did n't go to zero `` One of the most fascinating aspects of this rally is that people are still not euphoric or even very enthusiastic. We suspect that when a large dip does come, it will be caused by too much good news.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,653.45, up 18.21 from the week before. Other readings for the week showed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index up 1.26 at 191.64; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market up 4.60 at a record 457.42, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index up 1.59 at 376.10. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 182.43 million shares a day, against 179.62 million the week before. Whenever the stock market has looked vulnerable to a setback this year, a new corporate takeover story seems to have come along to revive it. That has helped extend a dominant theme of the 1980s _ a shrinking supply of stock available to investors. `` The continuing shrinkage of the supply of equities is playing a major role in this market,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. At some point, in theory at least, stock prices could get high enough to drive away takeover bidders. Though that day may be getting nearer, contends <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, it is not yet at hand. `` Clearly, rising prices have now precluded a number of potential deals,'' he said, `` but the possibilities still seem rather abundant. `` With huge pools of capital anxious to be deployed and armies of investment bankers with lifestyles to support, the continuing shrinkage of equity should keep pushing stock prices higher.''

 The word racketeer has acquired some new meaning in the high-living financial world, and it's not a name for the guy who strings tennis rackets at the country club. To a half-dozen securities professionals convicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and 46 futures traders indicted in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> under a tough law aimed at fighting organized crime, `` racketeer'' is like the ghost of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, a stigma that could plague them for the rest of their lives. If anyone in the lucrative business of buying and selling stocks, bonds and commodities still had any illusion they were somehow exempt from prosecution under this law, they likely were sobered by the events of this past week. Of particular significance were the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> convictions in the so-called Princeton-Newport case, based on what many attorneys had called confused and even flimsy evidence of fraud. This showed with dramatic certainty that juries will convict Wall Streeters under the racketeering law. It's an ominous sign for similar defendants facing trial, especially <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the ex-junk bond trader for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> who faces far more serious charges. The Princeton-Newport case concerned a now-dissolved investment firm called <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. Five of its members and another ex-Drexel trader were accused of creating phony tax losses via prearranged securities trades. Two days after the Princeton-Newport verdicts, prosecutors in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> announced long-awaited indictments stemming from a lengthy undercover probe of alleged fraud in the world's largest commodities markets. Again using the racketeering law, prosecutors accused the 46 defendants of turning the trading pits into their own private clubs where they reserved the best deals for themselves and tossed the dregs to unsuspecting clients. Both the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prosecutions represent an aggressive application of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act or RICO, as it's commonly called. It was enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nearly two decades ago to combat gangsters. The law is considered one of the most powerful enforcement tools ever enacted in this country, enabling prosecutors to seize a suspect's assets before trial and providing for crippling fines and lengthy prison terms upon conviction. Despite criticism from many lawyers that the law is excessive, its application has expanded over the years to prosecutions of criminal defendants ranging from union bosses to motorcycle gangs to politicians. The RICO acronym, also the name of the Capone-like mobster played by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in the 1930 film `` <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>,'' was coined by one of the law's authors, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, a Notre Dame law professor. `` RICO means crime is called by its correct name,'' <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON> once said. `` If people are running a racket, why should n't we try them for being a racketeer?'' In other business and economic news this past week: _ Convoluted economic reports sent confusing signals into the financial markets The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its chief forecasting gauge fell 0.1 percent in June, the fourth drop in five months and a strong signal of a slowdown. But the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said unemployment dropped in July, suggesting the economy is growing stronger. _ Alleged sleazy business practices hurt the reputations of the nation's largest drug chain, charge-card company and home-shopping network <ORGANIZATION> Rite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its president were indicted on charges they tried to bribe an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> regulator. A top executive at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> resigned for his role in trying to discredit a rival international banker through a smear campaign. <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was slammed with a $ 100 million defamation verdict for falsely claiming <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> telephone mismanagement hurt its sales. _ In the takeover business, investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> knocked on <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s door with a $ 2.85 billion offer but the cosmetic giant rejected it; and <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, in a $ 2.4 billion deal that would create one of the world's largest metal
