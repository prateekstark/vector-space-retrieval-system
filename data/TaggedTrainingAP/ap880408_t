<HEAD>Government to Publish Guidelines For Drug Testimng Of Federal
Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government will publish stringent technical guidelines Monday for the random drug testing of federal employees in sensitive jobs, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions that the guidelines will guard against employee cheating by requiring that toilet water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of urine. Temperature readings will be taken from the samples to detect substitution. Quoting an unidentified government source, the newspaper said next week's printing in the Federal Register will be followed by a certification by <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> that all federal agencies have a drug-testing program that meets the guidelines. Although all agencies have submitted plans outlining who will be tested and for what drugs, the final certification date was unclear. Agencies will be required to test for cocaine and marijuana, but may test for PCP, opiates and amphetamines. Finally, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> must estimate the cost of implementation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the regulations become effective. The working estimate is thought to be `` about $ 7 million,'' the paper said. The new guidelines draw heavily on the experience of the testing which has been conducted in the military for the last seven years. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> is the only non-military agency testing employees in sensitive jobs. The American Federation of Government Employees, which has filed suit in federal district court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> against earlier informal standards, contends the random drug testing violates workers' constitutional rights.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it was suspending its effort to mediate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis as the first major split appeared in the opposition to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said in a statement he was withdrawing his mediation offer for three reasons: _ Opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it showed it was willing to discuss the departure of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ The archbishop had not received <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` explicit and personal backing of the initiative'' in writing _ There were no assurances that the four international leaders who proposed the talks could be present The breakdown came a day after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ordered the arrests of several leading opponents. The general has defied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to force his resignation. In another development, banking and diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks would not reopen Friday, and possibly not next week. The government said last week it hoped to have banks functioning again Friday. Police detained 15 people Thursday night after using tear gas and rubber hoses to break up a march of between 500 and 1,000 anti-government demonstrators in the western city of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. Civilian sources contacted by telephone said National Civic Crusade members were beaten, but there were no immediate reports of serious injuries. A major rift appeared Thursday in the anti-Noriega opposition, as two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own anti-government movement. Their leaders argued that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions are hurting <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s people more than they are damaging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the civilian government he controls. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in a break with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of about 200 organizations that has led the 10-month-old effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. They told a news conference their movement also is backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition political party. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has supported the Civic Crusade in its effort to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include the military and police. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, which he denies. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said the new movement rejects any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence. `` For us, no recipe that comes from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been favorable to the Panamanians,'' he said. `` The people of the world know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, never are favorable to the interests of the people.'' He added: `` It is absolutely necessary for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to abandon his post. For us, this is fundamental.'' Leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations, strikes and other protests of the Civic Crusade, while differing with some of its policies and generally favoring a harder line. Popular Action, for example, refused to join the Crusade, Authentic Panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to the proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the Catholic church. The dialogue was proposed by Presidents <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and ex-presidents <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Political parties linked most closely with the Civic Crusade are the Democratic Christians and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Molirena </PERSON>. Those two parties, the Crusade and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> all recognize deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the constitutional head of state. Popular Action and the Authentic Panamanian Party do not. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated the ouster of <LOCATION> Delvalle </LOCATION> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, brother of a former Popular Action presidential candidate, said the movement `` will center its fight on the original principles of the Civic Crusade.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not continue economic and military action against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> said. `` The Panamanian people are capable of solving their own problems.'' Banking and diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said bank would not open Friday even on a limited basis. They said bankers feared the government would use their deposits if they reopened. The government, whose deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks have been frozen, has not met public payrolls since the crisis began. The last of 1,300 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers arrived Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, completing a buildup meant to provide greater security for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, American installations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Late Wednesday, the government said it had issued arrest warrants for three leading opponents, including <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It also asked <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police organization, to arrest <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON>, a former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s envoy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and remains there. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would regard any efforts by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime to attempt arrests or prosecutions of President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and the others for their activities in urging and supporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions as the unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime.''

<TEXT>
 A woman whose son disappeared in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> says police found his car abandoned on a highway four months ago but never checked inside the trunk, where a body was discovered by a towing company this week. The coroner in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> said he was completing an autopsy Thursday to determine whether the decomposed body found in the trunk of the <ORGANIZATION> red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> is that of 25-year-old <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumaine </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geary </PERSON> said the body has been tentatively identified as <PERSON> Dumaine </PERSON> and the case is being investigated as a homicide. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the man's mother, said <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> police repeatedly assured her that no foul play was involved in the disappearance of <PERSON> Dumaine </PERSON>, who apparently won $ 5,200 in a casino en route home for Christmas but was never heard from again. Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she last spoke with her son on Nov. 27, when he called from <LOCATION> Bullhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a small town on the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> border about 100 miles from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, to say he was stopping in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on his way East. <PERSON> Dumaine </PERSON>'s car was found in December, police said, and sat on the lot of Quality Towing in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> about four months before workers noticed a strong odor and checked the trunk. `` They opened the trunk and found my son,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 45, said. `` I could n't believe it. I wanted them to open that trunk for so long and four months later they decided to open it.'' <PERSON> Dumaine </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Westfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had traveled around the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was training to become a chef and had worked on boats, his mother said.

 The race for best supporting actor of 1987 provides <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> voters a choice among a perspiring TV reporter, a steely <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cop, a philandering <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> husband, a wily <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> pimp and a South African martyr. The nominees are a diverse lot, ranging from the first <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> to a stand-up comedian. None has ever won an Oscar. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> is generally considered the quintessential 007, a role that seemed impossible for him to escape. But after 30 years in films, he has finally been recognized for his performance as another enforcer, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> beat cop <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> in `` The Untouchables.'' `` I thought it was a very clever concept to take the old cop and use him as a kind of old dog who teaches a new dog tricks,'' says <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> of his role as mentor to the young federal agent, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>. Yet Connery is maintaining a classic Bond cool over the possibility of winning his first Oscar. `` To be honest, I've never really spent much time thinking about it before,'' he said in a recent interview. `` I just go on with my work.'' Neither is he bitter that it has taken the Academy some 40 films to even nominate him. `` It's all a matter of timing and how your films and image are presented,'' <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> told the Hollywood Reporter. `` There are a lot of my films which I'm very proud of, which I think were artistic successes, but were n't huge box office successes like the Bond pictures.'' There's no chance, though, that <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> will snub the Academy if he wins. `` It'd be important to me, and I'd definitely turn up to collect it. I'm not one of those actors who'd send along the cleaning lady instead.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> accomplished the near-impossible: winning a nomination in a film released early in the year to scant notice. His role as vicious `` Fast Black'' in `` Street Smart'' was dynamic enough to remain in Academy voters' minds. Born in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and raised in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, before moving to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> built up an impressive number of stage credits before appearing in such films as `` Brubaker,'' `` Teachers'' and `` <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>.'' His performance in `` Street Smart'' prompted this outburst from the New Yorker's <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kael </PERSON>: `` Is <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> the greatest actor in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today?'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> admits to a rough life while growing up in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>: `` I stole, I conned, I passed the tests But I was scared. I'm not the violent type.'' This contrasts the brutal role he plays in `` Street Smart.'' Instead of sliding into delinquency, the young <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> found himself attracted to acting, and sold bottles so he would have money to go to the movies. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardenia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s excitable father in `` Moonstruck,'' has been in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater since 1954 and films since 1958. He also was a member of the `` All in the Family'' cast on television. <PERSON> Gardenia </PERSON> was ideal casting as the Italian plumber; his family emigrated from <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, and he began acting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Italian theater. He was delighted with the `` Moonstruck'' script: `` It was the first about an Italian family in a long time that you do n't see shooting, killings, bombings. It's about love, about family.'' <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> was cast in `` Cry Freedom'' after a worldwide search for an actor to play the vital role of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, the black leader who was beaten to death by South African police while in their custody. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> admits that his nomination was `` both a letdown and a great honor.'' The letdown came because <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> had been promoting him for best actor, and he had been nominated for a Golden Globe in that category. He adds that his reaction was n't the result of an actor's ego. `` It has more to do with my own feelings about <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>,'' he says. `` I would like to see him in -LRB- a starring -RRB- light, and I think most people do. He was not a supporting player.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> faced an imposing challenge: portraying a much-admired, even revered figure while making him a believable human being. `` I do n't know how to play a saint,'' he says. `` I could n't get any advice from anyone on how to play a saint. So that was no problem.'' Under <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>'s direction, he created a portrait of the martyr that was both human and convincing. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the effect of `` Cry Freedom'' on the apartheid issue will be on a personal level. `` Most of the comments I've gotten from people were that they did n't know what goes on in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That's where it will have its most important effect. I do n't think it's going to make a change in the government's attitude or the attitude of the black people there. It's just a movie, commenting on something from the outside.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, the astute reporter and failed anchorman of `` Broadcast News,'' is noted for directing himself in films: `` Real Life,'' `` Modern Romance,'' `` Lost in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a stand-up comedian before making films, says that the role of <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> was different from his own life: `` I do n't work in the news business I do n't have a 9 to 5 or even a 9 to 9 job. I do n't wear suits. I do n't have friends. ... Over a period of four months I hung out with a dozen reporters. I think what happens is you sort of compile little things from everybody.''

<HEAD>Civilians Form `Dignity Battalions' To Repel Yankee Invasion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In dusty fields and stadiums across <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, civilians turn out by the hundreds for military training to repel what the government says is an imminent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. `` We get political speeches, and sometimes we see patriotic films,'' said <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, a government housing ministry employee. `` We do physical training and we have some weapons instruction.'' The volunteer units, called `` Dignity Battalions,'' formed, and have grown, since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> started announcing increases in troop strength in the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone in mid-March. There is close-order drill, replete with slogans vowing death on behalf of the homeland and questioning the ancestry of all <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>. About 300 volunteers showed up on one field near the capital Wednesday night, and some said it is one of the smallest battalions in the country. The battalion in the western city of <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> is said to have more than 1,000 participants. There is no reliable estimate on participation nationwide. In one corner of the field an instructor explained the basics of an M-16 rifle and passed several among his charges. Some, but not all, handled it uncomfortably. `` The Americans have them with a grenade launcher attatched. Do we have those too?'' asked one youth. `` Yes, we do,'' the instructor answered patiently. `` Hey, do n't point that thing at another comrade. The government press is predicting loudly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will resort to invasion troops to oust Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. As head of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense forces, <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> is the power behind the civilian government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> normally keeps 10,000 troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to guard the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. In mid-March 500 military police were added, and 1,300 more troops arrived this week. The stated purpose of their open-ended assignment is to provide security for the troops, American installations and American citizens. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said 800 Marines will start arriving Friday for three weeks of routine jungle training. Evening papers Wednesday ballyhooed the planned arrival but neglected to mention the short planned stay. `` In Ships of Terror and Death, Contingents of War Veterans of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> Arrive in Open Plan of Aggression and Intimidation,'' read a headline in the government-owned Matutino newspaper. `` Gringo Invaders Begin to Arrive,'' read a headline in Wednesday's <PERSON> Critica </PERSON>, also government-owned. A cartoon shows Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> fleeing from gunfire from the `` popular forces,'' as the battalions also are known. The government closed all opposition media more than a month ago. All that Panamanians watch, read or hear comes from newspapers and broadcast stations owned at least partially by the government. Foreign newspapers brought in by travelers are confiscated at the airport. The volunteer battalions are instructed by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> troops, who appear patient and have their work cut out for them. Most participants appear in their late teens or early to mid-20s. A few are easily 50. Many are women and all say they are not paid or required to attend the two-hour evening sessions held seven days a week. There is no roll call and no apparent other check of who shows up. `` We fight for our homeland and our dignity. The <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> only fight for money,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. The instruction and the rhetoric were more reminiscent of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in recent years than a country where Americans have been well-tolerated, if not always cherished, for most of this century. The feeling is growing, it appears, but is far from universal. In a shabbier sector of downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a woman held up two shotgun shells fired by police during a minor demonstration. `` This is what they shoot at the people, like they are beasts,'' she said as the tear gas lifted. `` We've had it up to here. `` Panamanians are tired of this. We want the gringos to attack _ not tomorrow, today.'' `` Tonight,'' suggested a young man in a crowd that was gathering near two journalists. But those on the drill field felt otherwise. `` We believe an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> invasion is close, very close,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, an office holder in the nearby municipality of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, speaks sincerely of American bodies going back to their home towns and said he is not worried about weapons availability. `` In revolutions in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> they did n't worry about weapons,'' he said. `` They took them from their dead enemies.''

<TEXT>
 A curious new program is going out over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s state radio every Monday morning. It's called `` The West Speaks,'' and it is composed entirely of excerpts of Polish-language broadcasts by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other Western radio stations. The segments are broadcast without comment or counterpoint, but since the program went on the air the Polish media and officials have criticized the Western broadcasts with greater frequency. The Western stations always have been characterized here as hostile propaganda tools, but the Communist government says `` The West Speaks'' is one way to counter the influence of the broadcasts that deliver a mixture of uncensored news, features and commentary. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stopped the electronic jamming of Western broadcasts Jan. 1 and Poles now can freely tune in to them. But government authorities have been raising the question of their fairness with Western officials, including the director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, who was here on a visit in March. The authorities say that in the struggle for the hearts and minds of the Polish people, they can not afford to overlook the influence of the Western stations. `` It does n't matter how many people listen to it when it is something very dangerous,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Even if it's only 100 people, that is enough, because the report will spread.'' At one time, particularly during the Cold War years in the 1950s, it was a crime to listen to the Western stations. Today, however, the strains of `` Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' the sign-on tune of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, can be heard coming from apartments in housing blocks. Urban said Polish authorities believed that countering the broadcasts with `` polemics and arguments'' was better than continuing the jamming. A public opinion poll quoted by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said 80 percent of respondents approved the decision to end the jamming, but it said the number of listeners has not risen significantly. How many people actually listen remains a matter of dispute. According to a survey quoted by Urban, the percentage of Poles who listen to Radio Free Europe either regularly or occasionally is 16 percent, up 2 percentage points since jamming ended. Only 3 percent, or 1.2 million out of the population of 37.5 million, listen as often as once a week, he said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, the body that oversees <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, says 59 percent of Poles listen to its broadcasts occasionally and nearly 14 percent at least once a week. An informal survey of half a dozen <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> residents indicated that most preferred the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> to Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION>, on grounds that their information was more reliable. Recent <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts were heavy with reports of demonstrations and protests in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, speeches and statements by leaders of the outlawed Solidarity trade union and accounts of opposition activities in other countries of the Soviet bloc. `` The West Speaks'' was conceived `` to show what sort of argumentation is used by these stations,'' said <PERSON> Witold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankowski </PERSON>, an executive of Polish Radio One. He said the show, which premiered in October, was given a time slot when `` we have a pretty good audience,'' but said he could not judge its popularity or say how long it would be continued. In recent months a drumbeat of commentaries have shown up on the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> service and in state-run newspapers disputing specific news items on the Western stations. Urban has made denunciations of the broadcasts almost a fixture at his weekly news conferences. In the interview, Urban noted that listenership tends to rise in times of public anxiety, such as during the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He claimed <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION>'s `` disgraceful methods'' frightened people in its reports on <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> and in its coverage of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s announcement in late January of price increases totaling 42 percent in 1988 `` Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> presents the opinion that prices in fact will go up twice as much,'' he said. `` They want to cause, and really do cause, an increase in wage demands.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> defends the broadcasts. `` The great bulk of what goes out seems to me to be a repetition of what already has been published in the West,'' he said. `` It is broadcast in, sometimes with comment, and comment is fair game.'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> director who arrived in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on March 23 for a series of talks with Polish officials, said the Polish side raised objections about Radio Free Europe and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the complaints were discussed `` very forthrightly.'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, which is privately opeated but largely funded by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, have charters that mandate that they be `` objective and accurate.'' `` I invited the authorities to give me specific instances when they were not,'' he said. He added that editorials on Radio Free Europe and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> are not intended to be objective, but to `` reflect the editorial viewpoint of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government.'' As such, he said, they might not be pleasing to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 The ladies of the club _ <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Always </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> _ are throwing a bash today, and as usual the guests of honor are themselves. The dozen or so retired school secretaries plan to treat themselves to a fancy lunch, toast their single status and present themselves with an extra special gift. That's for the years and years of giving presents to their married friends, but never getting anything back. `` This is really to treat ourselves because no one else really has,'' explained <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieffer </PERSON>, 63, who's serving as the queen, or organizer, of today's gathering of the society, otherwise known as WASPS. `` Oh, Lordy, every time you turn around you're giving gifts. Wedding gifts and baby gifts and shower gifts. You could n't begin to count them. You're giving all the time, but you're not getting anything in return,'' said <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Eck </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, 81, a founding member of the 38-year-old society. Miss <PERSON> Kieffer </PERSON> is giving herself a new white coat. Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, a widow who married late in life, is celebrating with a watch on a necklace. Gifts can be whatever the women need or want. Over the years, presents have included diamond rings, new cars, houses, European vacations, even a custom-made girdle. `` She was quite a heavy girl and she could never get a girdle to fit her. So she had one made,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said Thursday. Each woman writes a poem, to herself naturally, and gives herself a card that reads, `` I love me.'' They also sing this peppy tune: `` That's where our money's spent, on all the gals who went. We bought them everything to keep them supplied. We think the time is due to get a gift or two. So WASPS let's see what you brought you.'' The conversation covers just about everything except for children, grandchildren and, of course, men. `` That's why it's so nice. I do n't have to listen to stories about everybody's wonderful grandchildren,'' Miss <PERSON> Kieffer </PERSON> said, laughing. The members, ranging in age from their mid-50s to late 80s, have been gathering every April since 1950, when Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> and 23 other never-wed secretaries for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> decided enough was enough. They formed the society after learning about a similar group in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. To be eligible, women had to be single and employed as a secretary for the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> for at least 10 years. `` If you were married, somebody would have had some plush party for you. So that was it. We'd be the contributors,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. `` But you could be married after that because once a WASP, always a WASP.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says the society likely has its roots in the days when female teachers in some parts of the country were barred from saying `` I do.'' `` They just extended themselves through their kids'' in school, he said. The Women Always Stung for Presents Society grew to more than 60 members around 1970, but has since dwindled to 14, seven of them founding members. Two women are now married. Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> is the only widow. `` A lot of them -LRB- members -RRB- have died,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. Secretaries nowadays simply are n't interested. `` They do n't want to have that brand,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Viehman </PERSON>, 69, said. `` To say they've been working for 10 years and they are n't married, I guess it's terrible. It does n't bother me, but it does some people.'' The society meets once a year on April Fools' Day. The date was pushed back this year since Good Friday fell on April 1. The restaurant get-togethers are mandatory and planned months in advance. Members who can drive pick up those who ca n't. Just about everybody comes freshly coiffed and sporting a new outfit. `` We enjoy seeing each other because who knows who will be there next year,'' Miss <PERSON> Kieffer </PERSON> said. `` Our girls are all getting older,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> agreed. `` But we always say if there's one left, that one will go. We'll keep it up.''

 A jury on Thursday convicted former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> of theft by extortion for threatening a parole board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in the <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration. `` Any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict, but it's difficult to believe,'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said in the courtroom moments after the jury returned its verdict. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who was a top aide to the now-ousted <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor, was accused of threatening <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a member of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> allegedly threatened to withhold permission for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to work as a part-time <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> justice of the peace and to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> appointee. Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a May 6 sentencing for the 59-year-old <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who faces up to five years in prison. Asked whether the verdict would be appealed, defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> said, `` We'll take it one step at a time.'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said, `` That's up to counsel.'' Jury foreman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a fire captain in suburban <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, said the deciding factor behind the verdict was `` the tapes of the phone call between <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> at home from the office of the state attorney general, who taped the call. During testimony Monday, <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> denied that he threatened <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> or told him how he should vote. But the state alleged that <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> followed up on the alleged threat in a letter and a telephone conversation after <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> voted with the board majority to seek Ms. <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>'s resignation. The board voted 4-3 that Ms. <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> should step down because of low staff morale. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, a former five-term congressman, testified that he did suggest that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> should back Ms. <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> but denied that he tried to `` steal'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s vote by threatening his job. <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Reinstein </PERSON> to declare a mistrial, contending the conviction of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> at his state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial Monday might prejudice jurors against <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Reinstein </PERSON> ruled that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to run unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as a Republican.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Defendants Argue Both Directions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is being attacked in opposite directions by the Iran-Contra defendants, with one claiming he improperly ignored congressional testimony and the other three saying he illegally used it. Attorneys representing former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> moved Thursday to dismiss the indictment against them, claiming <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> illegally relied on testimony the three gave last year to the Iran-Contra congressional committees after being granted limited immunity. Because of the immunity grants, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was required to collect all of his evidence independently. North, <PERSON> Piondexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> claim that, given the massive publicity surrounding the hearings, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s case was inevitably tainted by exposure to their immunized _ regardless of efforts to insulate investigators and grand jurors from that evidence. But lawyers for retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the fourth defendant, claim that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> unfairly ignored the congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. They say that testimony would have led the grand jury to decline to name their client in the 23-count indictment. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who brokered the arms sales with <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, was the lead witness at last year's televised hearings of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra committees and testified without any immunity. All four defendants are accused of conspiring to divert profits illegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. The so-called `` use immunity'' grants conferred by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> prohibit <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from using evidence obtained directly or indirectly from their congressional testimony. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> imposed special precautions to prevent his staff and the grand jury from being exposed to the extensive publicity surrounding the hearings. Prosecutors and grand jurors alike were told to ignore news reports or conversations with friends about the hearings. Evidence was filed under seal in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to prove that it was obtained independently of the immunized testimony. But in pleadings filed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> said those precautions were not enough. `` Never in the history of this nation has the immunized testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all major networks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' the defense said. `` Given the widespread dissemination of immunized testimony throughout our society, the broad use of immunized testimony has been inevitable, undeniable, and so pervasive that the indictment must be dismissed as a matter of law,'' the defense argued. As an alternative to dismissing the charges, the defense asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to conduct a hearing to determine if immunized congressional testimony influenced <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation. The defense says it wants to question grand jurors to determine if they learned about the congressional hearings from friends, relatives or news broadcasts or from grand jury witnesses. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyers are taking a different course. They contend that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> unfairly refused to consider the congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, which they contend would vindicate their client of any wrongdoing. The grand jury should have had an opportunity to consider this testimony before returning an indictment against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, his lawyers said. `` The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorial convenience above General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s Fifth Amendment right to a fair and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and requires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictment be dismissed,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyers said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has scheduled a hearing next Tuesday to discuss the immunity issue, which could take months to resolve.

<HEAD>Biology May Explain Why Some Children Are Bashful, Say Researchers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Extremely shy children and those who are very outgoing may be responding to a biological rhythm set at birth and continued throughout life, researchers say in a study published today. A scientist from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and two from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> said in a study published in the journal Science that extremely inhibited children experience a more rapid heart beat, a dilation of the pupils and increased muscular tension when they encounter novel experiences or social stresses. `` It appears that a small percentage of children are born with a biological disposition that would tend to make them shy, and this is independent of what the parent has or has not done,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Reznick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychologist. Although the study postulated a `` biological constitution'' for shyness, <PERSON> Reznick </PERSON> emphasized that this finding `` in no way indicates that -LRB- the shy -RRB- child will not be successful.'' `` They learn to compensate,'' <PERSON> Reznick </PERSON> said. `` They may learn strategies that would make them appear not to be shy.'' <PERSON> Reznick </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON> drew these conclusions from a series of tests that followed a group of children from the age 20 months to 7 -LCB- years. Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON> said in an interview that the scientists determined which children were extremely shy and which were outgoing by observing their response to novel situations in a playroom. `` Does the child immediately go to the center of the room and start playing, or does the child stay close to the mother? If a stranger walks in, does the child retreat to his mother, or go over and approach the stranger?'' said Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON>. The researchers also observed how the children reacted to new toys, to youngsters unknown to them, and how often the children spoke. `` If you took a random sample of children, you would find about 10 percent at either end of the scale,'' Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON> said. `` The rest of the children will do a little of both _ that's most children.'' After identifying the shy and the outgoing children, the researchers tested them for physiological reactions. They found that the shy youngsters tended to have faster heart rates that accelerated more rapidly in the presence of novel situations. Heart rates for the uninhibited children were among the lowest. Shy children also experienced marked dilation of the pupils, a rise in a body chemical that is produced during stress, and a change in the voice quality caused by muscle tenseness. This fundamental pattern remained consistent through all the years of the study, said Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON>, although `` as these children grow older, you see the behavior responses in different ways.'' When the children were 7 -LCB-, the scientists conducted a party for three shy youngsters, another three who were uninhibited and four who were in between. `` We find that the children whom we classified as inhibited at 20 months were the children in this party situation who tended to stay a little distant from the other children and not talk as much in the free play situation,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON>. Although it has yet to be demonstrated by study, <PERSON> Reznick </PERSON> said `` it would seem reasonable to believe that the biological differences would continue through life.'' But such a person, said Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON>, `` can learn to cope very well.'' `` Some children who are very inhibited have parents who are very understanding and deal with it very well,'' she said. `` Those children look less inhibited as they get older.'' The shy child may be very successful in school, said Ms. <PERSON> Snidman </PERSON>. `` They are quiet and attentive. Teachers love them.''

 A mock newspaper scribbled in a notebook by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> at the age of 18 sold for nearly $ 22,500 at an auction of rock and pop music memorabilia, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auctioneers said. A flame-shaped bass guitar used by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> of `` The Who'' surprised bidders by selling for 15,000 pounds -LRB- $ 28,005 -RRB- at Thursday's sale, which yielded a total of 188,694 pounds -LRB- $ 352,291 -RRB-. Three manuscripts for songs by <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, who was shot to death in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1980 at the age of 40, also drew high prices. In the four-page mock newspaper written in a school notebook, <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> wrote nonsense and comic text and poetry and drew cartoons in crayon. It was called the Daily Howl and priced at 1 penny or `` a halfpenny to the vicar.'' <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s called it an important stylistic landmark to be compared with <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s later written works. The <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> guitar _ one of 140 in his collection and five up for auction _ was sold to an unidentified buyer. The guitarist, who attended the auction, said he decided to put the instruments up for sale because they were taking up too much space in his house. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s manuscript lyrics for the 1964 song `` If I Fell'' were purchased by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> client for 7,800 pounds, and his manuscript for the 1964 tune `` Any Time at All'' was purchased by an anonymous person for 6,000 pounds. A Japanese Beatles Fan Club linked to the auction by satellite purchased 19 of the 250 items on sale for 8,000 pounds. Japanese coordinator <PERSON> Mariko </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> said `` the Beatles are very popular in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' partly because <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, is Japanese.

 As if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s yuppies did n't have enough to worry about in the fallout from the stock market crash, they're now faced with anarchists plotting a `` National Anti-Yuppie Day.'' Adding to the misery of yuppie job losses, pay cuts and dwindling stock portfolios is Class War, an anarchists' group, which announced a 22-city rock concert tour in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for August dubbed `` Rock against the Rich.'' It said in a statement made available Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that it hopes the tour will culminate in an anti-yuppie extravaganza on Sept. 10. Just who Class War is has never been clear. `` It's not a club you join,'' said a sympathizer, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>. Nor has the size of its membership been divulged. Group members sometimes surface in anti-capitalist stunts like a 1984 campaign in which bank windows were smashed, a smoke bomb exploded near the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and about 470 people were arrested. But why pick on yuppies? Class War explained: `` All over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a plague of yuppies are descending on working-class communities like locusts. The time to resist is now _ let's Rock Against the Rich.'' In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> said it was `` because people have been pushed out from areas where they have always lived because of greed on the part of speculators, because it is n't possible to afford to buy somewhere to live in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> unless you have a hell of a lot of money.'' The story of the anti-yuppie campaign was broken, appropriately enough, in the Independent newspaper, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s newest daily and a favorite among yuppies. Its good-natured report Thursday on Class War's manifesto said: `` With this defiant, if ungrammatical, declaration, a new musical movement has been launched.'' But the newspaper wrote: `` Rock Against the Rich seems very unlikely to raise anything like the level of support given by musicians and audiences to the anti-fascist Rock Against Racism in the 1970s or pro-Labor -LRB- Party -RRB- Red Wedge rock tours before the last general election.'' The concerts are to be held in cities, like <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, whose run-down inner areas are being `` gentrified'' by wealthy young newcomers, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> said. An exception is <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, the heart of the stockbroker belt south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the concert has been dubbed, `` Rock Against Stockbrokers.'' The planned anti-yuppie day's main attraction is an outdoor rock concert in the Docklands, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, where gentrifiers have been clashing with the local residents, the group said. Docklands developers say they have rescued the area from irreversible decline and provided affordable housing for local residents. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Strummer </PERSON>, previously guitarist with The Clash, a 1970s rock group, has agreed to join the tour, as well as other, less well-known musicians, Class War said. The group is targeting yuppies because `` they come off flaunting wealth when there's none there to start with,'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s yuppie class grew visibly during Big Bang, the huge deregulation of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s financial markets in 1986. Expanding investment firms paid top money to attract brokers and bankers, and many yuppie-haters reacted with glee to the stock market crash last October. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> still suffers from class antagonisms and the tug-of-war between capitalism and socialism continues unabated. Some see Class War as just another manifestation of British eccentricity. Others see a more sinister side in the group's reported support for `` taxing'' yuppies by mugging and burglarizing them Class War is `` tapping real feeling in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who wrote about the group for the Independent, said in a telephone interview. But `` it's hard to know what their real influence is. Opinions vary on the left about whether they are publicity-seeking idiots or whether they are doing anything, even on the far left.'' `` Their rhetoric is quite nasty,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> added. `` Nobody else -LRB- political groups -RRB- will have anything to do with them.''

 A hearing on a commuter airline crash that killed 18 people focused Thursday on why the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reduced a staff member's recommendation of a $ 250,000 fine to $ 16,500. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official had recommended the fine against <ORGANIZATION> Ryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for more about 250 safety and records violations. The airline has been cited or fined several times for paperwork and safety violations in recent years. A tail-heavy, overloaded Ryan Air Beech 1900 crashed Nov. 23 at the Homer Airport in the country's worst commuter airline crash in 19 years. Eighteen people died and only three survived. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members and their aides spent Thursday questioning <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> employees about the crash, the 10th <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> accident in eight years. Four involved fatalities. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON>, now seeking protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, was grounded in January as part of a consent agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. Before the agreement, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest commuter airline, serving more than 80 cities and communities. The investigators tried to piece together why three of the company's pilots who volunteered to provide records concerning overloaded flights in exchange for immunity were rebuffed by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. One of the pilots, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Deliman </PERSON>, was killed in the Homer crash. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossen </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> operations inspector, said he conducted a week-long inspection in February 1987 and found scores of discrepancies in record keeping, pilot competency checks and training records. He recommended a $ 250,000 civil penalty _ $ 1,000 per violation. `` That's the largest civil penalty I've ever recommended,'' he testified. `` I felt like a high civil penalty would have more or as much impact as a -LRB- flight certificate -RRB- suspension.'' His former boss, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, testified he supported the recommendation. The suggested fine was passed up the line, but was bounced back with instructions to gather more evidence. <PERSON> Gossen </PERSON> said he again submitted the recommendation. It was rejected by former <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regional counsel <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boberick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gossen </PERSON> said he tried again, reducing the suggested penalty to $ 25,000. Boberick reduced the fine to $ 16,500. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Westall </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of flight standards in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> told the board the proposed fine was reduced because of `` purely legal defects.'' Courts in the past have not supported the notion of a $ 1,000 fine per violation, he said. <PERSON> Westall </PERSON> said he first supported the proposed $ 250,000 fine, but then changed his mind after talking with <PERSON> Boberick </PERSON>. `` In this case, he convinced me,'' <PERSON> Westall </PERSON> said. The $ 16,500 fine will not be assessed unless the airline again gets airborne, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steucke </PERSON> said. Despite his airline's history of problems, <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was forced from his position as president of <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> by the January consent order, testified Wednesday his company had been the target of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> harassment. `` <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> was our largest carrier, so they got a larger part of our inspections,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> was over inspected because of the size and complexity of their operation.'' After the November crash, the airline was cited by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for flying Beech 1900s that were tail-heavy at least four times in the month before the fatal accident.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration must answer tough questions about whether its support for the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels led it to wink at multimillion-dollar drug deals, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> says. The Foreign Relations subcommittee headed by <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., has heard a week of testimony about the daring night-time flights and huge profits made by cocaine and marijuana traffickers, along with allegations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials knew about some of the trafficking but did nothing to halt it Two convicted drug smugglers testified Thursday that weapons were illegally flown to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for the Contras and hundreds of pounds of cocaine were brought back on the return flights. The Contras have denied that they were involved in illegal drug trafficking. `` I think it is important to look at the link between the Contras and drugs,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said Thursday, `` but this is not meant to be focused on the Contra effort. The issue is whether a specific foreign policy goal -LRB- aiding the Contras -RRB- assumed a larger-than-life importance so that some things were permitted that should not have been.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> chairs the Foreign Relations subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism, which is investigating the relationship between Latin American governments and the drug trade. `` I think what we've shown is that there is an enormous amount more that needs to be done to improve enforcement of the drug laws,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. `` You ca n't ever stop it, but you can slow it down with more effective enforcement.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>, who is serving a 27-year prison sentence for drug trafficking, testified Thursday that he had twice flown planeloads of weapons from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in July 1984. The weapons were replaced with hundreds of pounds of cocaine, he said. As <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> described his career flying illegal drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he described a series of high-risk trips in which he flew at wave-top level to avoid radar. He said that on one occasion, he entered <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by flying between high-rise condominium buildings along the city's coastline. On another occasion, he said, mechanical and navigational troubles forced him to fly over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where he was chased by MiG-19 jets until he dived down to tree-top level. The profits were huge, according to <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>, who said he was paid to $ 200,000 per planeload for delivering drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>'s story was echoed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, a Colombian native who says he began dealing drugs in 1979. Within several years, he had made enough money to build an empire that included a fleet of 10 to 15 planes, helicopters, and speedy boats. <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> is serving a 27-year prison term for cocaine trafficking, while <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> is doing a 16-year term for his conviction on the same charge. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said he gave the Contras `` several million dollars'' from his drug profits. On one occasion, he estimated the amount at between $ 3 million and $ 4 million, but he later said the figure was $ 5 million to $ 6 million. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> also said he arranged six times between 1984 and 1986 to ship weapons from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the Contras because he said <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> officials who claimed to be <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operatives promised to try to get drug charges dropped against him. Both <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> said the weapons were delivered to an airstrip near a northern Costa Rican ranch owned by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, an American who has been linked to both the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> met the plane each time and watched as the small arms, including M-16 rifles, mines and C-4 explosives, were unloaded, <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> said. The plane was then loaded with cocaine, <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> said, and he flew back to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He estimated that he carried about 500 kilograms -LRB- 1,100 pounds -RRB- of cocaine on each return flight. ABC News on Thursday described a network that it said shipped Eastern European arms to the Contras and Latin American drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Citing unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Panamanian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, the network said that from 1983 to 1986 Israeli agents, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial support, purchased arms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, shipped them from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and on to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. From there, the network said, the arms were flown to Contra supply drops in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said the same planes and pilots then flew illegal drugs from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The network said the operation was launched with $ 20 million in Israeli government money, which was later reimbursed from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert funds. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harreri </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> liaison who also served as an aide to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was the middleman. It said former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was the American connection. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said the Israeli government denied Thursday that it supplied arms to the Contras and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has denied he was involved in such a supply network.

<HEAD>Kirk Seeks To Minimize Clashes Over Platform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 National Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says he wants to minimize the clash of interest groups so his party can draft a 1988 platform that Democrats `` can run with and not shy away from.'' But <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, chairman of the platform committee, says at least one interest group will be courted this year: the business community. `` They think socially they have to be Republicans, for whatever reason. But the majority are really independent people,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. `` I would like to see special efforts with the business community.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said Thursday there will be state and regional platform hearings around the country over the next two months. Some interest groups said they welcomed this news, since <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> earlier suggested there might be only two _ in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But they scoffed at what they called an effort to keep controversial planks out of the platform. `` We are concerned about statements that they did not wish to cater to special interests, they want to open up the process and to bring in new groups,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems to us that business is also a special interest, and we do n't understand quite how women, who are over half the population, can be categorized as a special interest.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> pledged to draft a lean document and avoid the kind of divisive battles that have marked previous efforts at writing party platforms. `` I'd like to think that someone will read it other than opponents,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. `` The platform is more than just what <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> thinks. It has to be one all Democrats are comfortable with.'' Even so, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have `` significant representation'' on the platform committee, regardless of who becomes the party nominee. He called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign `` an important constructive force within the Democratic party.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> seemed to soften suggestions he made last December that platform writers would avoid emotionally charged issues on which there was not common agreement. He vowed Thursday the party would not `` sound a retreat'' from issues it had championed in the past, including the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> and abortion rights. Asked specifically about abortion, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said: `` I think our party has always embraced the rights of privacy, the rights of individual choice.'' However, he tempered his comments by saying that such issues `` can be addressed in a way without being divisive or controversial.'' `` I think we can put together a platform that a national audience can respond to and that all elected Democratic officials can run with and not shy away from,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` I would have been much happier if he said, ` we will of course keep equal rights and abortion planks,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. Turning to the Democratic campaign, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> joined <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in urging Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to tone down his negative campaigning. He called <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s admonition to the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator to stop criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` helpful and on course.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> also reiterated his view that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> would not become a presidential candidate, even in a brokered convention. `` There is a game going on on the field,'' he said. `` That's where the nominee's going to be be chosen from.

 A mentally ill man killed by police was merely pretending to hold his teen-age girlfriend captive and used toy guns during a three-hour standoff, authorities said Thursday. The guns 19-year-old Israel <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> held to the girl's head and brandished at police from the window of his second-floor apartment were plastic water pistols and the `` hostage situation was a charade,'' York County District Attorney <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebert </PERSON> said at a news conference. The 15-year-old girl, a <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> runaway whose name was not released, was a willing participant, he said. Officials did not discuss the motive behind the charade. A police marksman shot <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> once in the abdomen and he died several hours later at <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Police originally said the marksman fired when <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> threatened to kill the girl. But film taken by <ORGANIZATION> WGAL-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was shot seconds after yelling, `` I'm coming out'' and placing both hands on a window frame. No gun was in sight. <PERSON> Rebert </PERSON> and other officials refused to identify the officer who fired the fatal shot. They said he was on administrative leave without pay, pending the outcome of an investigation that is expected to last up to four weeks. The officials refused to say if any charges would be filed against the teen-ager.

 Spring is in the air and so is courting _ especially among the Democratic presidential hopefuls as they woo the party's unpledged delegates to the national convention. Faced with the possibility that the primary process will not produce a clear-cut delegate leader, the candidates are focusing on the 645 `` super delegates'' who could tip the balance in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 18-21. Campaign brochures, news clippings and position papers fill the mailboxes of the super delegates _ 25 governors, 362 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members, 253 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and five elder statesmen _ who could push a candidate closer to the 2,082 total needed to nominate. Some campaigns rely on phone calls, such as those made to <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a Democratic national committeewoman from <LOCATION> Keene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, who remains uncommitted. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> phoned twice and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, called too. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s staff called as well. Mrs. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> says she has heard from all the candidates except <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Since last fall, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has been laying the foundation with the super delegates through phone calls, mailings and personal contact, said delegate counter <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>. In recent weeks, aides have stepped up the pressure. `` It's much more focused, an intense effort,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. `` When it looks like he's pulling away ... at that time we'll seek a more formal pledge of support.'' The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign has relied on congressional communication on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as well as phone calls and mailings to the delegates, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutcheson </PERSON>, delegate counter for the senator. `` There's great potential among the super delegates,'' said <PERSON> Hutcheson </PERSON>, who describes the field as `` fertile territory'' for his candidate. `` The super delegates are most interested in a ticket that can win.'' The Jackson forces, however, are just getting started in their campaign for super delegates. `` I looked into what kind of a strategy he had to deal with them and who he had doing it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who is advising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It turns out they apparently had very little. There's some mail being passed back and forth.'' `` It's something they have to do and they're probably very late in doing it,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said last week he will lead the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> effort to court the super delegates. `` The front line is the congressional Black Caucus ... to talk to our colleagues in our states, to lobby people who are super delegates,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contends that if he leads in pledged delegates after the last primaries on June 7, he deserves the support of the super delegates and should get the nomination. `` We know that the super votes give rise to super delegates,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said last week after meeting with a select group of Democratic leaders. `` The delegates must respect and respond to the will of the people. `` If we do not believe that, why have a primary? Have a super-delegate convention and let the super delegates choose someone of their own,'' he said. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speaker and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national campaign chairman, said the campaign would use primary results to convince the super delegates. `` We will take the popular vote in their state or their district and say this is a factor you should consider,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The constant communication _ by telephone and by mail _ is all too familiar to some super delegates. `` They do n't call on a per day basis,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, an uncommitted super delegate from <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` They called before and after <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, before and after <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. They tell us how well the candidates are doing.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the campaigns phone to find out `` if there's anything I want to know about the candidate, if I'm getting the mailings. They're very diplomatic.'' <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivo </PERSON>, an uncommitted super delegate from <LOCATION> Rosenberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has received `` a lot of calls from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' and expects it to get `` hot and heavy'' as the convention nears. Other delegates say the courting has n't even begun in earnest. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a former supporter of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, said he had n't heard from any campaign since his candidate dropped out of the race two weeks ago. And <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON>, a former congresswoman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said she's heard from all the campaigns, but `` I do n't think they're vigorously working on it.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s choice to become the No. 2 official in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is under fire for his membership in an all-male athletic club and an all-white country club. `` It makes it hard to imagine he'll be able to administer justice in government in a way that's non-discriminatory when in his own personal life he does n't live up to that,'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will vote on whether to confirm <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> as deputy attorney general, if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> goes ahead and nominates him. Committee members said Thursday that it is too soon to comment on Shepherd's membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which has no female members, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bellerive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which has no blacks. Both are in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, 62, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney, could not be reached for comment Thursday. He was not in his office, and his home phone number is unlisted. But on Wednesday he told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> he had not yet decided whether he should resign from the clubs. `` I have n't made up my mind on whether that would be necessary,'' he told the newspaper. `` I am going to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for nine months to help the attorney general as his deputy.'' <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials about his club memberships in conversations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this week. He added that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` is aware of this.'' In the same interview, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> also said he was confident he would be cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> of allegations that he had an affair with a former bookkeeper at his firm and that he had authorized her to write $ 147,000 in checks to herself. He added that the allegations by <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, 29, of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, `` are absolutely untrue and unfounded.'' Sinner was convicted last month in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges of making false statements and stealing more than $ 100,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION>'s law firm, <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sandberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Sinner's attorney, <PERSON> Darrill </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>, said Thursday he was surprised when he heard that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had chosen Shepherd for a top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post. However, he said he and Sinner would testify before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> `` only if we're subpoenaed. We're not volunteering.'' <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was tapped by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on Tuesday to fill the deputy attorney general's job following the March 29 protest resignation of <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> quit along with Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> because of concerns that the 11-month criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was dragging down the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, department sources have said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> left Wednesday on a trip to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to discuss anti-drug efforts. Shepherd's memberships in the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bellerive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> were first reported by NBC News. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the athletic club in downtown <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, confirmed Thursday that <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> is a member and said the club, founded in 1904, does not accept women. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, president of the country club in suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> has been a member there since 1970. `` There are no black members,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` but our bylaws specify that the club is open to everybody.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, however, that membership in the country club is through invitation only and `` to the best of my knowledge, no black has ever been proposed for membership.'' A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, said the group's code of conduct prohibits members who are judges from belonging to private clubs that practice `` invidious discrimination.'' Ms. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> also has a policy that prohibits meetings from being held in such private clubs. The issue of membership in exclusionary clubs has arisen before, with mixed results. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s nominee for attorney general, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during his confirmation hearings he would resign from such clubs. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first attorney general, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, refused to follow that example and was confirmed anyway. More recently, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> resigned from membership in two exclusionary clubs when his name was first mentioned as a possible nominee for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He was subsequently confirmed as a justice.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle to be Equipped With Crew Escape Pole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says the first space shuttle to fly since the Challenger accident will be equipped with the equivalent of a fireman's pole so astronauts can slide to safety if the craft has to ditch in the ocean. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> chose the pole escape method Thursday over an alternative that would have used rockets to propel the crew away from the shuttle Discovery in an emergency. By sliding down the pole, the astronauts would clear the shuttle's tail before parachuting into the sea, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says. For all the strength that allows the shuttle to withstand the buffeting that accompanies a climb or descent through the atmosphere, the vehicle probably could not survive a crash landing on the ocean. `` The telescoping pole was selected as it has shown to be safer, simpler to operate, lighter weight and easier to support than the tractor rocket system,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, a top shuttle program official. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the 10 -LCB- - foot pole already is being installed in Discovery and will be ready for the first flight, scheduled for Aug. 4 The aluminum and steel pole weighs 241 pounds, 70 pounds lighter than the rocket system. Moreover, top <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said all along they were uncomfortable with storing explosive rockets in the crew cabin. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the 1986 Challenger accident, found that no escape method would have saved the seven astronauts who died in that explosion. But, it said, `` The crew should have a means of escaping the orbiter in controlled, gliding flight.'' The pole is intended for just such a purpose. If the shuttle had to ditch _ either on an aborted launching or on return from space _ the pole would be extended out the side hatch and the crew would attach themselves to it with rings on their parachutes and slide down, one at a time. During launch and landing, the unextended pole will be pointed toward the hatch. It will be stowed while the shuttle is in orbit. The Challenger astronauts died during ascent while the solid rocket boosters were still firing and attached to the shuttle. Engineers say the new escape system can not be used while the shuttle is connected to the rockets. `` This decision completes the crew escape system package,'' a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` The agency already has replaced the spacecraft's hatch so it can be jettisoned with explosive bolts and it is installing a partial pressure suit, oxygen equipment, a parachute, a life raft and survival equipment for each crew member.'' Under the rocket system, the astronauts would have to jettison the hatch, and, one-by-one, lie on a metal ramp that slanted out the door. Each one would have to attach a line to a small rocket housed in an adjacent rack and be pulled out. The pole system was tested in February and March, using a fixed pole that extended through a hatch-like opening in a C-141 cargo plane. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> parachutists completed 66 jumps, using cords attached to their parachute harnesses to slide down the pole and descend to a safe landing. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the side hatch jettison system can also be helpful if an emergency should require a quick crew exit once the ship is on the ground. The new hatch contains an escape slide similar to those on commercial airliners.

<HEAD>Teamsters Trim Wage Increase To Improve Pension Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teamster truck drivers and warehouse workers are giving up some of the wage increase their union has just negotiated for them in exchange for more pension and other fringe benefits. The new proposed National Master Freight Agreement unveiled Thursday differs from the tentative pact signed last week by the union and <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's bargaining arm. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>, a Teamster spokesman, acknowledged Thursday that some key provisions in the proposed contract were re-negotiated this week in response to pockets of opposition to them within the union. `` There were always some i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed,'' <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said. `` Obviously pension matters were of primary concern and the negotiators responded to the dictates of what the membership felt was important.'' <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said the union plans to begin mailing out ballots next week for a rank-and-file ratification vote, with ballot counting and announcement of the results to occur in mid-May. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' constitution, rejection of a negotiated contract requires a two-thirds membership vote against it. About 200,000 workers are covered by the contract. When signed a week ago, the proposed three-year accord included an immediate 50-cent hourly wage increase followed by 35-cent raises in April 1989 and again in 1990. The 15-cent difference the first year is being switched to contributions by employers to the union's pension and health and welfare funds. The union's pension fund now provides retirees with a monthly pension check of up to $ 1,500. Instead of a 20-cents-per-hour increase in contributions to the two funds in each of the three years, trucking companies would now kick in 35 cents more an hour this year. If ratified, the contract would raise the base wage rate for truck drivers from the current $ 14.71 to $ 15.06 hour, retroactive to April 1. Wages would rise to $ 15.41 an hour in April 1989 and to $ 15.76 in 1990. So-called `` casual'' part-time workers now paid about $ 3 an hour less than the top scale also will get the same hourly wage and benefit increases under the renegotiated pact, <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belous </PERSON>, a labor market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business research house, said the renegotiated contract belies a myth that, with lower tax rates, workers would opt for more pay than benefits. `` Given the choice between cash and security, workers are telling their negotiators to go back and get more security.'' <PERSON> Belous </PERSON> said. `` Once they reach a certain pay level, they want more protection against the vagaries of ill health and old age.'' The contract also recoups for <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> some of the concessions the union yielded to the industry in 1985. A two-tier wage system in which new hires started out at 70 percent of the base scale and rose by 10 percent a year to 100 percent at the end of three years is diminished by half. Under the new accord, new hires will start at 85 percent of the top scale, rising by 5 percentage points every six months until they reach 100 percent after a year and one-half. Many within the union had complained the two-tier scales were allowing the largest trucking companies who are adding new hires to their payrolls to undercut freight rates of small companies with older work forces.

 The nation's budget director and the postmaster general disagree over whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail ought to be turned over to private companies, and postal workers are siding with their boss. Budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in a seminar Thursday that the Postal Service should not have a monopoly on letter deliveries. Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> indicated to the same group he does n't like the idea of so-called `` privatization.'' As the two attended meetings sponsored by the conservative think tank <ORGANIZATION> Cato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, union leader <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> led 100 picketers outside in a cold drizzle. `` <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, he's a jerk; privatization just wo n't work,'' the group chanted. <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s proposal `` cockeyed'' and said it would cause chaos with the mail and increase costs to the public. The <ORGANIZATION> APWU </ORGANIZATION> is the largest of four mail unions, representing about 365,000 of the nation's 800,000 postal workers <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> said that accusations that the postal monopoly is causing increased costs are `` unmitigated lies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CATO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, in a report issued as postal rates went up Sunday, said mail service is getting slower, more expensive and less reliable because of the lack of competition. Wearing a sign accusing <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of betraying postal reform, <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> stood at the doorway of the seminar room for a few minutes before the budget director arrived. As the doors were closed, he told seminar organizers, `` You're afraid of a free society.'' <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> later followed <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> into the hotel and shook his hand, saying he wanted to debate him on the idea of turning over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to private business. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in a speech: `` There is no good reason why it -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- should remain part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and no good reason why it should enjoy a monopoly over the delivery of letter mail.'' He accused the service of wanting to be a government-protected monopoly when it comes to letter mail and a federal agency when it comes to federal subsidies and other benefits. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> denied allegations from the postal unions and others that his <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> has tried to intrude into management of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is an independent government agency. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who took over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> March 1, suggested privatization could be a code word for union-busting. He said he is against eliminating the letter-mail monopoly the service has and does not believe private companies should be allowed to skim off profitable segments of the postal service. He said, however, he would support a genuine effort to promote efficiency by sharing work with private mailers and contracting more non-critical postal services. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the Postal Service should be `` the most efficient, reliable, convenient public service in the country.'' He noted that private package services deliver only a tiny fraction of the 500 million items a day handled by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He said even advocates of privatization realize changes must be gradual, adding, `` I sense a desire to go slowly, a recognition that the mail system, like <ORGANIZATION> Humpty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dumpty </ORGANIZATION>, once broken, could n't be put back together again.''

<HEAD>Antarctic Icebergs Increasing With Warming Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Earth's slowly rising temperature may be to blame for the recent increase in icebergs breaking off from <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, government ice specialists say. They ca n't be sure yet, but officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy-NOAA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> note that as the global temperature has increased, so have the size and number of icebergs. `` An abnormally high amount of ice shelf calving is occurring in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said Thursday. Increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere over the last century or so have been associated with rising temperatures around the world. Some scientists believe that the temperature increase, amounting to one or two degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, could lead to major climate changes including melting the ice in the polar regions. This could cause a rise in the ocean level around the world and cause major changes in weather patterns, climatologists have warned. `` The poles are sensitive indicators of change'' in the Earth's climate, <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said But while the increase in icebergs may be a result of the rising temperature, there is n't yet enough information to be certain, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Koffler </PERSON>, who heads the satellite services at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have only 12 years of data,'' added <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>. `` That is nothing in the geological bucket.'' But he noted that both abnormally large icebergs and an increasing number of bergs have been breaking loose in the last year or two. Whether this will be a continuing trend he declined to forecast, saying `` the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, as a system, is difficult to predict.'' <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said the iceberg increase was notable in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> area. It's harder to determine if more bergs are arising in the arctic, where they tend to be smaller and larger in number anyway, he said. But in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> two exceptional iceberge have broken loose in the last two years. Last year a berg called B-9 broke off the <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> ice shelf. Measuring 86 miles by 23 miles, B-9 covered 1,978 square miles, nearly as big as <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. At 800 feet thick, it contains enough water to supply <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for 700 years, said <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>. And loose in the ocean it could be a serious hazard to shipping. B-9 has run aground on an underwater mountain, he said, but is likely to break free eventually, and could take from two to seven years to melt, he said. An even larger iceberg broke free from the other side of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> in 1986, <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> added, but that has since split into pieces, leaving B-9 as the largest floating mass of ice. Other smaller bergs have broken free also, though numbers were not available. Indeed, many bergs are too small to register on the satellites used to watch them, which track items about a half-mile across and larger. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said that within a few years improved satellites will be in place to allow smaller bergs to be followed. The Center is responsible for monitoring ice conditions in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and most of the oceans of the world. The lone exception is the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, where bergs are tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> operation set up in 1912 following the Titanic disaster. The two groups share data.

 It seems that elephants can get by with whispering where most of us would have to shout. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, an elephant researcher in <LOCATION> Etosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, says that elephants can be heard for as far away as three miles when they `` talk.'' But most of the time only other elephants can hear. Two-thirds of the sounds they make are too low for humans, just as a dog whistle makes sounds too high for the limited human ear, she says. `` If you get close enough to the elephant, though, you can feel them,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher said Thursday at a news conference hosted by her sponsor, the World Wildlife Fund. `` It's like thunder, sometimes, or being in church close to the lowest pipe on the organ. Pigeons and guinea fowl can hear such `` infra-sounds,'' an Asian grouse called the capercaillie is known to make some, and fin whales make quite a lot, but elephants seem to be the first land animals found to have the talent. `` The existence of these calls may help explain how elephants coordinate their society over long distances,'' Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> wrote in a summary of her work. She knows about a dozen different sounds that elephants make, such as the kind of greeting chorused by a group of females when a male has found them. `` The males can tell one another things like ` That's <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> and her group over there' or ` There's big aggressive bull out that way','' she said. `` It's a repertoire, not a language.'' Other identifiable sounds include those between baby elephants and mothers. She said there is some evidence that a mother and calf can distinguish one another by sounds they make. Between the elephant's eyes, where there might be a nose if there were no trunk, lies a thick fold of skin that she says can be seen vibrating when the sound is made. In one experiment, the researchers played the pre-recorded call of a female elephant in heat to a pair of males. The call was not too easy to record because a given female elephant may be in heat for only one day in four years. `` It goes like this,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, peering earnestly through her gold-rimmed glasses. `` Only of course I'm 10 octaves too high.'' She made a soft, undulating sound _ `` whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo.'' There are usually a series of such sounds, each about seven seconds long, she said. She showed a film of the episode, shot from a specially built tower last August by a water hole in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Near the tower other members of the team manned concealed a loudspeaker. Clocks were coordinated, down to fractions of a second. When two young male elephants appeared, the filming began. At a moment that was not signalled to the photographer, the loudspeaker began playing the female elephant sounds, inaudible to the humans concerned. A moment afterwards the two males stopped their play. The film shows them standing altogether still, something elephants rarely do. Their huge ears fan out. They both turn and start moving quickly in the direction of the loudspeaker. `` The boys at the loudspeaker were praying,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. `` The males came close, but they went right by and kept on going in the same direction. We do n't know how far.'' The two males would probably have fought if there actually had been a female at the other end of the call, she said.

 The longneck beer may be the beverage of choice for more Texans, but five wineries from the Lone Star State are hoping to make a big splash at <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest wine festival. The wineries hope exposure at the <LOCATION> Vin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> show in <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> will increase their credibility with financial institutions that have been slow to lend them money for expansion in a state better known for its chili than its <PERSON> Chenin </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>. `` I think it will enhance the prestige of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wines to have competed at the premier wine festival in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said before leaving for the show, which opened today. `` Secondly, the marketing part of it will allow the wine brokers and merchants to know we have good quality wines in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. As head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> helped arranged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the show. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> participants are hoping international exposure will lay the groundwork for exports once financing through. Obtaining such financing has been hard, industry and government officials say, for a young industry in a state riddled with a record number of bank failures. `` Wines from a new producing region are greeted with skepticism and I think our wines are beyond that in terms of quality, and I think that will be recognized in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON>, president of the participating <LOCATION> Llano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estacado </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. `` We're making a statement about the quality of the wines we produce here,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a co-owner of the participating Pheasant Ridge winery, also in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. Also sending wines are Messina-Hof Wine Cellars in <LOCATION> Bryan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> winery in the Hill Country town of <LOCATION> Tow </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Bluebonnet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ballinger </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had one winery in 1975 _ today it has 22. Five of those wineries will join 30 others across the country from five other states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ in the first official exhibition of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wines at <LOCATION> Vin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is sponsoring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exhibit. It will be among 1,700 at the trade show, where more than 80,000 people are expected _ including wine critics, importers and distributors from 50 countries, according to de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>'s office. `` We are planting the seeds of a long-term harvest,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` My interest is that the wine show is looking down the road several years,'' <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON> said Wednesday from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. `` We're currently selling all of the wine we produce here in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ 45,000 cases this year We're very well supported here at home. So we do n't have a lot of wine to go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with. I'd like to lay the groundwork for developing a European market, and this is a good vehicle to do that with.'' Interest in American wines is growing and they are now a hot export item, says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Wine exports rose 64 percent in volume and 75 percent in value in 1987 over 1986, <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said Wednesday, for a total value of $ 60.8 million last year. That's still a fraction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine market, which had sales of $ 7.2 billion last year of imports and domestic wines. Industry figures indicate wine imports totaled $ 1 billion in 1987, <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said. But the depreciating dollar makes American wines a better buy in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> countries like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where an upscale segment of the population has plenty of disposable income to afford fine wines and enjoys experimenting with new products, he said. American exporters hope to appeal to that part of the market and are n't attempting to compete with the less expensive Italian wines, <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wines, and those from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other states have an opportunity to find a market niche. ... There's a certain cache in having an unusual American wine,'' <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 In a simpler time, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was better able to throw its weight around, it took little more than a snap of a finger in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to bring down a Central American strongman who ran afoul of American interests. But those days are long gone, as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is finding in its efforts to depose <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general's resilience in the face of relentless <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pressure has caused surprise and anguish and even a degree of grudging admiration here. As yet, there is still no happy ending to the crisis in sight _ and as a result, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been getting it from all sides. Some criticize it for cooperating with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for so long despite suspicions of his involvement in drug trafficking. Others say it has not gone far enough since breaking with him to force his ouster, while still others maintain that administration policies are misguided because they have harmed the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people more than <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Among other measures, the administration has blocked Panamanian access to $ 50 million in official Panamanian funds on deposit in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks and suspended payments for canal-related services. This has contributed to a financial collapse in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that, in turn, has led to widespread deprivation. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has sought to portray the crisis as the product of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interventionism while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insists that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> himself is responsible through actions that have led to deep alienation among Panamanians. The administration's latest tactic is to try to create dissension in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> heads. The administration believes that the more the defense forces think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may resort to military intervention, the more likely they will be to turn against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and force him into exile. This explains why the administration has refused to foreclose, publicly at least, the option of military intervention. It also was probably a contributing factor to the administration's decision to send 2,100 military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past week. The administration insists that the troops are being sent to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and interests in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and for routine training exercises. The troop deployment has nothing to do with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> insists. Still, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not be unhappy if the arrival of all these <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers generates nervousness within the Panamanian military. `` There are only a few thousand members of the PDF who are supposedly battle-trained,'' said one official, insisting on anonymity. `` They are not eager to take on the American military. They might conclude that their best hope of avoiding that possibility is to get rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s staying power contrasts with the way things used to be in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. In 1903, when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was a part of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the combination of a few hired hands sent to stir up trouble in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the deployment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> naval forces offshore led to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s secession from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Almost without effort, a new nation was created. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promptly recognized the fledgling state and, within two weeks, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> signed a treaty giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the perpetual right to a canal zone and the authority to build a transoceanic waterway. It was easier to get things done in those days but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now paying for the heavy-handedness of that era. As evidence, no Latin American country has voiced support for current administration policy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because each is worried it may some day be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> target if it does something to displease <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Six weeks after the crisis erupted, no quick solution is apparent. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could increase the pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by imposing a total trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but many officials fear that, as before, the primary victims of such a strategy would be Panamanians and not <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Beyond that, trade embargoes seldom achieve the desired objective. A 3-year-old trade ban against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has not loosened the Sandinista grip on power there. And it was 28 years ago that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed a trade embargo against Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who next January will celebrate his 30th anniversary in power.

 When the presidential campaigns of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> faltered, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> got a break _ to the tune of $ 45,000 a day. That's how much it cost to provide the three candidates with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection, according to administration officials and government documents. At one point in the 1988 presidential campaign, five candidates were under <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection, not counting Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who gets it anyway by virtue of his office. The cost: $ 15,000 a day, $ 105,000 a week for each candidate; $ 75,000 a day, $ 525,000 a week for all five. Now there are only two _ Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, passed up <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection because, according to his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, `` it would be just one additional layer from the people. However, as expensive as $ 75,000 a day might sound, it pales against the $ 4.9 million it cost to guard <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> during his 11-day visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Secret Service Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary for enforcement, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently that the pope's visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` the single most dal 1989. Candidate protection is determined by a five-member panel consisting of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority and minority leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and minority leader, who meet and make recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Among the things taken into consideration: the number of delegates a candidate receives and whether any death threats have been made against the candidate. If the secretary accepts the panel's recommendations, the candidate is notified. To decline protection, a candidate must inform the secretary in writing. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> gave up his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection Wednesday, the day before he announced he was suspending all campaign activities. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> quit the race March 28, surrendering his protection a day earlier. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s protection ended Wednesday. He has all but abandoned campaign activity. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said the advisory panel did not recommend protection for erstwhile candidates <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> or former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> DuPont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Along with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also declined protection during his unsuccessful run for the presidency. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> believes that <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection is too expensive and `` limits where you can go and what you can do. He likes to go out, meet the people and shake their hands.'' The converse applies, too. On his first day without <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents nearby, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was quick to exercise his new freedom. He jumped into his <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caprice </ORGANIZATION>, drove to a mall and bought two new sport shirts for a week-long family vacation in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 As top cop for the Academy Awards, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s job is to conjure up nightmarish scenarios and make sure he can respond to any calamity that might disrupt <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s biggest night. `` Woe be unto anyone who tries to disrupt the show,'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said. Intruders simply wo n't get past <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s security phalanx at Monday night's 60th annual Oscar ceremony, which has moved to the refurbished Shrine Auditorium five miles south of downtown. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, 60 _ a former professional wrestler, ex-policeman and retired security chief for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> _ has been <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>'s bodyguard for 17 years, and he's ready for just about anything `` By Monday, you just sit back and wring your hands and hope you thought of everything,'' he said. In addition 6,000 of the well-heeled and glamorous, the Academy Awards attracts a worldwide audience of millions, a curbside throng of squealing fans and sometimes a seamy contingent of malcontents, derelicts and fanatics. In the past, there have been bomb threats, political demonstrations, imposters, publicity-seekers and star-struck fans with elaborate schemes to get inside. There has never been a serious offense, however. `` We talk to young people and find out what the latest fad is,'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said, when asked about anticipating untoward acts. `` There was the pie in the face fad, the streaker fad, you name it and there is usually a new fad.'' But discussions with students this year have n't given him any clues. `` Apparently the younger people are more intent on their studies,'' he said. `` We ca n't find any one thing that is really in the mind of the kids. We have to think of everything as being a possibility and use our imaginations.'' Many have tired to pass illicitly through entrances in the past, but only a few have succeeded. There was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Opel </PERSON>, the infamous on-camera streaker of 1974. <ORGANIZATION> Opel </ORGANIZATION>, since deceased, was able to obtain credentials that permitted him backstage. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said that security hole has been plugged. `` I have yet to convince myself there was n't some collusion there,'' he said. There was once an imposter in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol uniform who looked like actor <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>. And a camper was once flushed out of a Music Center men's room stall the day before the awards show. Demonstrators come almost yearly to the Academy Awards, drawn by the presence of the world's news media or irked by the nomination of a certain movie or star, such as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>. Demonstrators clashed with police in 1979 when `` The Deer Hunter'' won best picture and angry <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans surged across the street fronting the Music Center. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> began planning Oscar security in January. He set up shop at the Shrine two weeks before showtime, a week earlier that usual because of the move from the Music Center. His job finishes when the last guest slips away from the post-Oscar Board of Governor's Ball More than 300 officers, under the direction of <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, will be on hand Monday night, and he is guaranteeing the safety of Academy guests into and out of the area near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> campus. Once they arrive, they wo n't have to leave, for the renovated Shrine, with new bathrooms, paint, red carpets and air conditioning, will be the site the Governor's Ball, instead of the Beverly Hilton Hotel crosstown. `` It will be a wonderful night,'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said.

 Here is the text of the `` A Piece of My Mind'' column entitled `` It's Over, Debbie'' from the Jan. 8, 1988 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The call came in the middle of the night. As a gynecology resident rotating through a large, private hospital, I had come to detest telephone calls, because invariably I would be up for several hours and would not feel good the next day. However, duty called, so I answered the phone. A nurse informed me that a patient was having difficulty getting rest, could I please see her. She was on 3 North. That was the gynecologic oncology unit, not my usual duty station. As I trudged along, bumping sleepily against walls and corners and not believing I was up again, I tried to imagine what I might find at the end of my walk. Maybe an elderly woman with an anxiety reaction, or perhaps something particularly horrible. I grabbed the chart from the nurses station on my way to the patient's room, and the nurse gave me some hurried details: a 20-year-old girl named <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> was dying of ovarian cancer. She was having unrelenting vomiting apparently as the result of an alcohol drip administered for sedation. Hmmm, I thought. Very sad. As I approached the room I could hear loud, labored breathing. I entered and saw an emaciated, dark-haired woman who appeared much older than 20. She was receiving nasal oxygen, had an IV, and was sitting in bed suffering from what was obviously severe air hunger. The chart noted her weight at 80 pounds. A second woman, also dark-haired but of middle age, stood at her right, holding her hand. Both looked up as I entered. The room seemed filled with the patient's desperate effort to survive. Her eyes were hollow, and she had suprasternal and intercostal retractions with her rapid inspirations. She had not eaten or slept in two days. She had not responded to chemotherapy and was being given supportive care only. It was a gallows scene, a cruel mockery of her youth and unfulfilled potential. Her only words to me were, `` Let's get this over with.'' I retreated with my thoughts to the nurses station. The patient was tired and needed rest. I could not give her health, but I could give her rest. I asked the nurse to draw 20 mg of morphine sulfate into a syringe. Enough, I thought, to do the job. I took the syringe into the room and told the two women I was going to give <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> something that would let her rest and to say good-bye. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> looked at the syringe, then laid her head on the pillow with her eyes open, watching what was left of the world. I injected the morphine intravenously and watched to see if my calculations on its effects would be correct. Within seconds her breathing slowed to a normal rate, her eyes closed, and her features softened as she seemed restful at last. The older woman stroked the hair of the now-sleeping patient. I waited for the inevitable next effect of depressing the respiratory drive. With clocklike certainty, within four minutes the breathing rate slowed even more, then became irregular, then ceased. The dark-haired woman stood erect and seemed relieved. It's over, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>. Name Withheld by Request.

<HEAD>FDA Effectively Bars Home AIDS Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has told prospective developers of home AIDS test kits they must limit market research to hospitals, clinics and other traditional health care settings. That and other restrictions contained in a March 30 policy statement effectively bar home test kits by heading off accumulation of the very kind of data that would be needed to convince the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to approve them. Despite the clear signal that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is not disposed to look kindly on such mass distribution of an AIDS test, the policy letter said the agency will seek public comment that could lead it to revise the guidelines. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will publish its guidelines for considering approval of home AIDS test kits in the Federal Register, along with its intention to convene public workshops on the issues surrounding such premarket research. The policy letter went to 17 people or companies who had expressed interest in marketing an AIDS test kit. Those parties, none identified by the agency, had been told earlier that <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> permission would have to be granted before they could be sold. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials have long expressed skepticism about any home AIDS test kit winning approval, because the disease is fatal and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> guidelines say any testing should be accompanied by appropriate counseling. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is a part of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 It remains to be seen if struggling author <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> ever will get his books published, but he's already auctioned off his manuscripts and other memorabilia. He raised $ 965, much less than the $ 15,000 he spent staging to stage it Thursday in the penthouse of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, a huge publicity stunt that surpassed even his own expectations. `` I'm thrilled people even thought this was worth something,'' he said. `` We did good.'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> watched as an old <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> baseball cap sold for $ 50, a dogeared dictionary for $ 40 and a manuscript of an unpublished book he wrote about the second <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON> trial fetched for $ 270. The money was of little importance. It was television news crews, magazine writers, newspaper reporters and other journalists that he hoped to snare. And snared they were as they came to his show, which included door prizes and an auctioneer who has sold memorabilia of <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> failed to find a publisher for his first two books so he planned the publicity stunt after finishing his latest novel, `` Run Red Riding Hood Run,'' a book that he said mixes murder, suspense and comedy. As was the case with his books on the second <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON> trial and his experiences at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, there's no publisher. As part of the hoopla, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> started the day by marrying <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> Counts at City Hall. He also attempted to lure several better-known -LRB- make that known -RRB- authors such as <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. Both said no, but sent messages, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s in the form of a `` rejection post card. Armed with the published evidence of his hype, the 34-year-old <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> author plans to go to a booksellers convention in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to peddle his product. `` This book has never been rejected,'' he said of his latest work after selling his collection of 30 rejection notices from publishers for his other books at the auction for $ 65. About 50 people attended the auction, mostly family, friends, reporters and the 10 models <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> hired to read his work to the group. Several serious bidders also showed up, including <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, president of Members Only, the clothing manufacturer. `` This is as contemporary as art can get,'' he said, explaining his interest in the works of a writer whose books have never been published. He bought a first draft of <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>'s new book for $ 45 at the auction, which, like most items, began with a bid of $ 2.75. `` Anything that starts at $ 2.75, I'll bid,'' he said. `` This is unique.'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said she bought a 431-page manuscript of <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>'s new unpublished novel for $ 270 for a friend who became interested after reading about the auction in an advertisement. She said her friend was betting on <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>'s future and hoped the manuscript would grow in value. `` I think it's the bargain of the century because I am going to be famous,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said.

 A Libyan defector who says he worked as a decoder for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s foreign ministry accuses Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of trying to assassinate the presidents of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Libyan authorities say the defector is a low-level diplomat wanted on morals charges who was recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to discredit <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. At a news conference Thursday organized by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s main opposition movement, The National Front for the Salvation of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said he defected from his post at the Libyan mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after being recalled `` for consultations.'' <PERSON> Saity </PERSON>, 29, said he realized then that his cover as an activist in the opposition movement had been blown, especially when he noticed he was being followed and his phone was tapped. He declined to say whether he would seek political asylum here, adding that the movement would take the necessary precautions against possible threats from <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> agents. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Azzabi </PERSON>, the spokesman for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s nine-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> disappeared at the end of January after being given an airline ticket and told to return home to face morals charges. He said he did not know what the specific charges were against <PERSON> Saity </PERSON>. `` Two things were on his mind all the time _ booze and women,'' <PERSON> Azzabi </PERSON> said. `` That was all he talked about.'' `` This is an all-out effort of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to discredit'' the political liberalization <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> introduced last month, <PERSON> Azzabi </PERSON> added. `` He was n't very important and he was not wanted for political reasons, so we did n't pay attention or send letters to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>'' when he disappeared, he added. <PERSON> Azzabi </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> worked with classified material. <PERSON> Saity </PERSON>, who spoke in Arabic through an interpreter, said he had been on the staff of the foreign minister in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, working as a decoder in the classified section of the ministry as well as at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission. In the course of his work, <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said, he saw communications from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to Libyan missions abroad. One such communication relayed through the ministry in 1984 was from <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinousi </PERSON>, the head of military intelligence, ordering the Libyan embassy in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> to kill visiting <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sinousi </PERSON> also sent an order to the embassy in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> to assassinate <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> at a francophone countries summit in 1985, <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> sent a man by the name of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabeida </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission to carry out attacks against his opponents living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had gotten wise to <PERSON> Zabeida </PERSON> and he had fled back to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986. The Libyan mission spokesman said he had never heard of the incident. `` His rule is synonymous with endless hostile interventions around the globe,'' <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. `` He has ransacked <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s wealth ... to fulfill his evil schemes.'' <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> denied being recruited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, but did not rule out contacting them in the future. `` It's too soon to tell'' about his plans, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had no knowledge of <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> or his activities. <PERSON> Saity </PERSON> said he was certain his parents in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> would be persecuted because of his defection but he felt compelled to denounce <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who `` has reduced <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to a refuge of crime, bankruptcy and corruption.''

<HEAD>Report Says Housing Agencies Do Little About Radon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 While federal environmental officials say radon gas causes up to 20,000 cancer deaths a year, federal housing agencies see little responsibility to respond, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says in a new report. The report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, made public Thursday, concludes that agencies in the housing business _ hamstrung in part by a lack of congressional guidance _ do little or nothing about the threat from deadly radon. The report scrutinizes the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Radon is a naturally occurring, odorless and colorless gas. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says radon may cause from 5,000 to 20,000 lung-cancer deaths annually.

<HEAD>Church Temporarily Suspends Mediation Effort; New Split in

<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> called off his attempt to mediate between Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the opposition, which has refused to negotiate unless the general first agrees to leave the country. Also Thursday, there was a split in the main anti-Noriega coalition. And police using tear gas and rubber hoses dispersed hundreds of anti-government demonstrators in the western city of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. A Roman Catholic church communique said mediation efforts were suspended because the opposition had insisted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ the nation's de facto ruler _ agree to depart and the general had failed to agree in writing to mediation. `` The church in no way surrenders the difficult task of mediation. It still considers it urgent and every day more so,'' said the communique, which asked all parties to remove obstacles so that talks might begin. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, which has led the Panamanian fight to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said in a statement issued after the church announcement that it stood by its negotiating conditions. A sign from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that he was willing to step down remained an `` indispensable and essential condition'' for opening talks, it said. In a communique that was not signed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the government had agreed to church mediation without preconditions. Earlier Thursday, two leaders of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced they were breaking with the 10-month-old Civic Crusade to form the Popular Civic Movement. It was the first major split in the opposition. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> told a news conference the new group had the support of the Authentic Panamanian Party, the country's largest opposition party. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said the splinter group also wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, but thinks it is a job for Panamanians, not Americans. The Civic Crusade's campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, has been backed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> The new opposition group opposes church mediation and does not recognize <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, deposed by pro-Noriega lawmakers on Feb. 26, as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president. Government prosecutor <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Visuetti </PERSON> disclosed Wednesday that an arrest warrant had been issued for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, in a videotape released to <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, said he would continue to fight to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who he tried to fire the day before he himself was removed. `` Fellow countrymen, we can not allow a gang of inhuman drug traffickers to be the owners of our public institutions and of the country itself,'' he said. The tape was reported made Thursday. In February, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frozen Panamanian deposits in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks, and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks closed during the first week of March. Civilian sources contacted by telephone in <PERSON> David </PERSON> said Civic Crusade members were beaten and arrested when police broke up a protest march Thursday evening. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Secchi </PERSON>, a Crusade member, said police used tear gas and rubber hoses to break up the march by more than 500 demonstrators. He said about 15 marchers were arrested. There were no immediate reports of injuries. With the arrival this week of 1,300 extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops this week, there now are about 11,800 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and guard American installations. Another 800 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines were to arrive today for jungle training that had been scheduled months ago. The Marines are slated to stay for three weeks. Banking officials put an end Thursday to government speculation the country's banks might open today or next week. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they feared the government would attempt to bleed deposits for its own use if the banks were to open. Lacking hard cash, the government has failed to meet its payroll for a month. People paid by check can not cash them. Panamanians with dollars are using them sparingly, and many now depend on charity for food.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wound up a five-day quest for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks today, acknowledging progress could be measured only in inches. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he expects to return to the region _ he did not say when _ to `` to struggle against the odds.'' He said his goal remains a comprehensive settlement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors and self-rule but not statehood for the Palestinians. `` I think the stakes are very high and the opportunities very great, even if the probabilities are against you,'' the secretary told a news conference. He praised King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for `` having engaged seriously with us for peace in the region.'' Earlier in the week, he called the king `` a partner for peace.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not offer an assessment of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, whose position toward a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference was an obstacle <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> could not overcome. The secretary had hoped to convene a peace conference by mid-April to launch talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians. `` I do n't think we are going to make it and that's obvious,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. But he bristled when one of the reporters at a news conference suggested his mission was doomed to failure. `` You have to be willing to do it,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` What am I saving myself for anyway? I have a few more months to go here and I want to try to leave something constructive for the region and for my successors, and so I'm going to put my back into it. Why not?'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has a little more than nine months left. The current trip is the third by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> since October to try to break a 40-year impasse between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors. Since early December, Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been rioting against their Israeli occupiers. At least 141 Arabs and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed in the wave of violence. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> objects to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for a peace conference because he finds in it opportunities for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to side with the Arabs, as it usually does, and try to impose an unfavorable settlement on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> gave assurances the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stand by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and not let that happen, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> held to his position. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he expected to return `` at some point in the future'' because it takes a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to bring the two sides together. `` You measure headway in inches, not miles,'' he said. The secretary said he was leaving special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy Wat Cluverius in the region to continue talks.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 9, 11, 14 to CORRECT spelling of Schulmann.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 A spokesman for the international banking community said today that creditor governments, not banks, have done too little to help Third World countries with their debts. The Third World governments want either grants, more new loans or relief from the burden of paying many billions on old ones every year, said <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>, a West German who heads the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>. `` Creditor governments have not done enough in bilateral relations to provide more official financing, to open their economies, or to improve the regulatory and tax regimes for private lenders and investors,'' said <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>'s comments were in a letter to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a joint group of the fund and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The fund and bank are owned by 151 countries. Many of those governments' top economic officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, are expected to attend the two institutions' joint semiannual meetings here next week <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and other government leaders have criticized commercial banks for their slowdown of lending in recent years and have recently been encouraging a `` menu'' of possible actions by the banks. Many of these actions would require the banks to get rid of loans at less than their face value. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, has quietly suggested that banks might also waive some of the billions of dollars of interest they collect every year. `` We have repeatedly noted the dramatic decline in commercial bank lending to developing countries and stressed the necessity for signficantly increased flows from the private banks as an essential ingredient of the debt strategy,'' he said in a report to be delivered to the Development Committee April 15. <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON> said many debtor governments have refused to seek the fund's help because it insists on such `` adjustment'' conditions as cutting government subsidies and devaluing currencies that lower their people's living standards. Fund officials argue that Third World countries will be worse off if their govnernments do not ask its help. <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had been only partly successful in getting debtor countries to make similar changes in their policies and that its lending has grown less than expected. `` There is a need for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to be more innovative in its approach to the debt problem,'' he said. He suggested that it should do more in the way of `` credit enhancements'' _ the kind of financing that lessens risk for banks. <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON> came out for an issue of `` special drawing rights,'' the fund's own kind of money, to member governments. This measure has long been urged by Third World governments but opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on grounds that it would encourage inflation. Third-World debt is expected to reach $ 1.245 trillion at the end of this year.

<TEXT>
 An attempted coup attempt last month against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> failed ignominiously when an officer loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> locked the plotters inside an arsenal, a newspaper reported today. Citing unidentified senior administration officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that the failure of the allegedly U.S.-backed coup has left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-Noriega plans in chaos The newspaper said several anti-Noriega members of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> went to the Central American nation's main arsenal in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last month to obtain guns for the attempt, pretending to be on official military business. The guard commander at the arsenal, however, locked the plotters inside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was in progress, the newspaper reported. Swift action by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters put down the conspiracy and resulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen anti-Noriega officers during the last several weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a well-placed military expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates `` the depth to which the administration planners have underestimated <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and misunderstood the situation there.''

 Lawmakers punched and pushed each other today in a wild melee in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> during a debate over whether to return the government's budget proposal to the Cabinet for more work. The fighting in the legislature, or Yuan, began when <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kao-cheng </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> jumped on the podium and grabbed the microphone from the Yuan's vice president to stop him from calling for a vote on the budget. Jaw Shau-kong of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> then grabbed <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> by the hand and pulled him from the podium. The two rolled down a stairway leading from the podium to the main floor as they scuffled. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> later told reporters that about 10 <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislators kicked and punched him after he fell to the floor. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>'s face was bruised and his glasses were broken. After the three-minute melee, the vice president called for a vote and the lawmakers overwhelming moved to debate the budget proposal at a later session. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said earlier in the session that the Cabinet, which submitted the proposal last month, should propose a new budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 by drastically cutting defense and other expenditures. About a third of the proposed budget of 568 billion <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 19.8 billion -RRB- would go to defense, the government says. But <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> and several other opposition legislators claim money earmarked for scientific, education and other purposes also would be used for defense.

 The national legislature today elected <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most powerful general, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, president in one-candidate balloting that was open for the first time to foreign reporters <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s election puts a close ally of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and staunch supporter of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s economic reforms in the largely ceremonial but highly visible post. The 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> remains chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, his only government post. Like <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was the only choice for the post in voting among 2,883 delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The legislature also elected <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who had been vice premier, to head the congress' standing commitee, which is responsible for legislative matters in between the full congress' once-a-year sessions. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has been meeting since March 25, is scheduled to elect the premier on Saturday and vice premiers on Tuesday. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> has been acting premier since November and is expected to be confirmed in that post. Foreign reporters watched from a balcony in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION> as the congress delegates, minus 87 who were said to `` have other business,'' marked large orange, red and yellow ballots and dropped them in boxes. It was the first time foreign reporters were allowed to watch the selection of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders. In a touch of democracy, 144 candidates were listed for the 135 ordinary seats on the congress' standing committee. Delegates also were told they could write in other names if they did not like the 144 choices. Also for the first time, legislators could mark their ballots in secret in enclosed areas in the rear of the hall. Most delegates, however, remained in their seats. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> were among the delegates who voted. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced the results but did not give vote counts. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> and Wan are both strong supporters of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s decade-long program of introducing market-style economic reforms and shaking up the stagnant government bureaucracy. The officials they replace _ 78-year-old <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> in the presidency and 86-year-old <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> as congress chairman _ were regarded as more conservative. As president, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> will play a highly visible role in meeting visiting foreign heads of state and presenting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy to them. His close ties to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> give him an influence beyond the presidency. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>'s new job as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was a powerless one for many years, but under <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> the legislature became more active in debating bills and even pressing for amendments. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s decision to stay on as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had been anticipated. The military has been his power base since he became top leader in 1978. In other posts, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON>, 80, a Long March veteran and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> member, was elected vice president. Nineteen vice-chairmen of the congress standing committee were elected, including 11 who had served as vice chairman of the previous congress' standing committee. Among the eight elected for the first time were <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaotong </PERSON>, 77, a sociologist and head of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s eight officially approved non-Communist parties.

<HEAD>Grade A Eggs Linked To Salmonella Outbreaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Raw or undercooked eggs _ even from perfect and sanitized shells _ may be spreading the salmonella bacteria in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, says a federal researcher who fears the problem may be spreading. Even sound Grade A eggs, which are screened for defects and cleansed outside with chemical disinfectant, appear to be implicated in the sickening of hundreds of people in recent years, the researcher said Thursday. Previous egg-related salmonella food poisoning has been limited to eggs that were cracked, dirty or in some other way defective or mishandled, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> of the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview, though, that his findings now implicate Grade A eggs _ the most widely sold egg in whole shell form. He said, however, that fully cooked eggs appear to present no danger. `` In all of the outbreaks we investigated, people ate the eggs raw or undercooked,'' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said. `` Consumers do n't need to stop eating eggs, but if they wish to avoid salmonella infections, they need to cook the eggs.'' <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCharen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the egg industry-funded <ORGANIZATION> Egg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said `` We're doing everything possible to correct and identify any problems.'' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and his colleagues began their investigation after learning of a sixfold increase in the number of infections caused by the bacteria salmonella enteritidis in Northeastern states from 1976 to 1986. The researchers found that in the nine affected states from January 1985 to May 1987, 65 food-borne outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis occurred and were associated with 2,119 food-poisoning cases and 11 deaths. In 35 outbreaks, the food bearing the infection could be identified, the researchers said. Twenty-seven of those 35 outbreaks `` were caused by Grade A shell eggs or food that contained such eggs,'' the researchers added. A separate survey of records concerning all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> salmonella outbreaks from 1973 to 1984 revealed that `` egg-containing foods were disproportionately associated with salmonella enteritidis infections both in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and in the rest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the researchers said. They reported their findings in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a food science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, however, that he believes the danger may be over and that the rash of outbreaks may have run its course. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a long-time researcher into egg safety, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that lab tests at 53 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> farms last year failed to turn up any trace of salmonella enteritidis contamination. `` We do n't think the problem is going away,'' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> countered. `` Outbreaks continue to occur. ... It's continuing to rise in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, and it's actually spreading out of the Northeast.'' Ms. <PERSON> McCharen </PERSON> added in a telephone interview Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers established a statistical link between some _ not all _ Northeastern salmonella outbreaks and eggs, and `` what they do n't know is why. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> agreed, saying one possible explanation is that salmonella infection may contaminate the ovaries of chickens and infect yolks before shells are formed. But he emphasized, `` We think the frequency of eggs being contaminated with salmonella is very low.'' He said about one-third of all chicken and <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> sold in stores is salmonella-contaminated, and slightly less than a third of the ground beef, but those infections are destroyed by cooking. In contrast, eggs often are eaten raw _ in hollandaise sauces, <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> salad dressings, homemade egg nog and ice cream, the researchers said. Where eggs are concerned, sufficient cooking is difficult to determine, but a previous study has suggested boiling for at least seven minutes, poaching for five minutes and frying on each side for at least three minutes, the study said. The Northeastern states included in the study were <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>JAMA Editor: Euthanasia Debate Must Go Forward To Develop Ethical
Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` It's Over, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>,'' a doctor's essay on the mercy killing of a patient, has focused debate on euthanasia much like the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> case did in the 1970s, says a prominent medical journal's editor. The newly galvanized debate over euthanasia will be fruitless, however, unless it results in guidelines enabling doctors to deal with ethical dilemmas, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> wrote for today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` Such discussions should not be confined to whispers in doctors' dressing rooms and hallways,'' says the editorial in JAMA, which started the debate by publishing the unsigned essay Jan. 8. In addition to the editorial, today's issue of JAMA included two commentaries on the essay and excerpts from 18 of the more than 150 letters the journal received. The essay's author described injecting a potentially lethal dose of morphine into a 20-year-old hospital patient dying of ovarian cancer. The physician, a gynecology resident awakened in the middle of the night to attend the woman, indicated the patient was a stranger, but that her pain and her plea, `` Let's get this over with,'' were moving. `` I believe the stark nature of the essay and the ambiguities within it, when coupled with a profession and public ready to talk about dying in greater detail, produced this massive national response,'' said <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>. `` ` Debbie' crystallized attention -LRB- on euthanasia -RRB- for this decade much as the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> case in the previous decade,'' he added. The parents of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, who lapsed into a coma in 1975, obtained court permission in 1976 to withdraw life-support systems. Miss <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> never regained consciousness, and died nine years later. In his editorial, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> sought to guide the course of the euthanasia debate by identifying six types of euthanasia, ranging from withholding resuscitation of terminal patients to killing a patient through such means as drug injection. He warned that, without action, laws may eventually result without sufficient input from the public and the medical profession. The essay has already caused legal action by a local prosecutor. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> served <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> with a subpoena shortly after the essay's publication, seeking the name of the author in an effort to determine whether a crime occurred. Journal editors refused, saying the essay was offered on condition of anonymity. A judge quashed the subpoena on March 18, citing <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' free-press law. Questions also have been raised about whether the event described actually happened. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said he believes the case is real. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> noted that active euthanasia already is performed in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and a public referendum on the practice may be on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ballot this year. `` The issues raised by this particularly abhorrent case and the consequent discussion about the ethics of euthaniasia are profound, eternal questions of humnan existence for which there are no necessarily ` correct' and certainly no clear answers,'' he said in the editorial. In an interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said most of the early letters were from doctors. They ran 4-to-1 against the action described in the essay and 3-to-1 against <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to publish it, he said. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, wrote, `` I ponder the prospect that in my final struggle, a similar white-coated figure will cast a shadow over my deathbed, poised to quickly administer the knockout blow and go back to bed, when I simply rang for a companion to ease my pains.'' The public response was more favorable, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said, but he provided no figures. Those letters suggested support for euthanasia in some situations, he said. `` Look at the courts and you will see a very small percentage of convictions for mercy killings and assisted suicides,'' wrote <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` Juries are filled with people of conscience who wish the same deliverance from a life whose quality has passed. `` To all those physicians who would deny me a lethal injection, on request, as I lie dying, I say, ` Whose life is it, anyway?'''

 Iranians voted for a new parliament today, hours after <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles crashed into several cities, in an election that will help determine the course of the Islamic revolution. The nation's 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, voted at an open-air election station near his home in the northern <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jamaran </LOCATION>. State-run television showed the black-turbaned leader dropping his ballot into the box, followed by his son <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>. The elections are the third to the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, since the 1979 revolution toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. The vote is seen as a test of strength between fundamentalists who support an Islamic-style capitalism and radicals who favor a socialist-style economy. The future course of the Islamic revolution is uncertain, and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is reported in ill health. Iranian leaders had expressed fear the Iraqis would blitz <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other major cities to disrupt the polling, but nevertheless urged the country's more than 20 million voters to cast ballots in defiance. A loud explosion rocked the area near a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> railroad station just hours before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 30,000 polling stations opened. Officials had no immediate details of the blast. But <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles crashed into the capital and the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>. It also said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes raided the western cities of <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hamadan </LOCATION>, killing an unspecified number of civilians. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, did not give any turnout figures but reported the Iranian people's `` massive presence'' at the polling stations <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> declared last week: `` The people will attend the election with God's help, even if they are under missile attack. I will vote under any circumstances.'' He warned: `` The people must beware and choose candidates among ... those loyal to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. They must choose their deputies from among those who have suffered from poverty and are real Moslems, not those who obey <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Islam.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was decked out in election posters, including bedsheet-size cloth banners bearing the names of the candidates. The 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the country's most pressing problem, has not figured in the campaigning <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has decreed that the war will not end until his adversary, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, has been toppled. About 1,400 candidates ran for the four-year terms as parliamentary deputies. They were approved by provincial and city governors controlled by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. That's about 400 more than campaigned in the last election in 1984. This year, for the first time, about 30 women ran. The results may not be known for 10 days, and the new parliament may not sit until June while a new cabinet is screened and nominees scrutinized by the deputies.

 Psychologist, author and teacher <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who suffered a fall in his kitchen just before Christmas, said he is doing fine following an operation for a head injury suffered in the accident. `` It's not a news story at all,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, 84, who was injured Dec. 20, said Thursday. `` I just slipped and fell and had a slight concussion.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a pioneer in behavioral psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he underwent an operation four weeks ago to relieve pressure from the head injury and was released from the hospital two weeks later. `` I'm in fine shape and I'm back home,'' said the author of `` Behavior of Organisms'' in 1938 and the utopian novel `` Walden Two'' in 1948. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who retired in 1974, said he plans to close his office at the university in September. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> came to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> as a graduate student in 1928, and has taught at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous gorillas, has a new human roommate who's trying to coax the pudgy primate into taking his first step outside in 25 years. Later this month, his keepers at <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> plan to introduce <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> and his fellow apes to a new outdoor habitat, which replaces the tile walls and steel bars of their old quarters. `` Gorillas tend to be very reticent, and after 25 years in the same place, he's just gotten used to his old home,'' zoo Director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said. `` This change, although it's a very positive change, is going to be viewed with some suspicion. We're going to have to induce him to enjoy his new habitat. `` Once he gets over this period, we think he's going to really enjoy it.'' For <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> 25 years ago at age 3, it might be the first time in his memory that he will have grass beneath his feet and the open sky above his head. And zoo officials have other surprises for <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>. They hope that within a year they can introduce him to another gorilla, probably a female. `` We're going to have to do it very carefully, so they do n't fight too much,'' Maple said Thursday Eventually, he said, it's hoped <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> will breed On Wednesday, Zoo <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> officials gave <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> his first complete physical, then showed him the new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter. They hope he'll get used to that within two weeks, and then, they will open the door. To coax him outside, keepers will place <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s food near the exit of his night quarters. He already can see that something is going on; zoo staffers are keeping a round-the-clock watch in the night quarters, including his keeper of 14 years, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who is sleeping in the next chamber. `` He's literally <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s best friend,'' Maple said. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is a very important part of our strategy of making him comfortable.'' In Wednesday's physical, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. _ named for long-time former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartsfield </PERSON> _ weighed in at nearly 460 pounds, with a 40-inch neck and a 64-inch chest. That's about 60 pounds overweight, but for a gorilla who's lived in a cage for 25 years, it's not too bad, <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said. `` The preliminary results are that he's in very good health,'' Maple said. `` We're surprised at his muscle tone and the quality of his condition.'' <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s first steps outdoors will be important for him, and equally important for <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> named the 99-year-old zoo one of the nation's worst just four years ago, before Maple, a specialist in primate psychology, was hired and launched a plan to convert the old facility into a modern outdoor animal habitat. `` This is the dawning of a new era at <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; I have no doubt about that,'' he said. `` You can call it one small step for a gorilla, one giant step for gorilla kind _ and certainly for the zoo.''

<HEAD>Researchers Discover New Dinosaur In Old Skull</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A misidentified dinosaur skull found in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>'s basement came from a previously unknown meat-eating reptile that was a pygmy cousin of Tyrannosaurus rex, scientists say. The skull was found on a southeast <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> farm 46 years ago by a museum expedition, but was misidentified as a gorgosaur, a relatively primitive, common carnivore, scientists said at a news conference Thursday. The new genus has been named <PERSON> Nanotyrannus </PERSON>, or `` pygmy tyrant,'' by the three scientists who discovered it. `` This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, adjunct curator of paleontology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he found the skull, believed to be the only Nanotyrannus specimen, while rummaging around the museum's basement last spring. `` The best place in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to find new -LRB- kinds -RRB- of dinosaurs ... is to look in basements, he said. `` There are never enough scientists to study specimens as soon as they come out of the crate. This came out of the crate in 1942. But no one did a detailed study.'' Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the Earth some 60 million years ago. <PERSON> Nanotyrannus </PERSON> resembled the bigger dinosaur, but was only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy. It probably weighed less than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. The skull, about 22 inches long and 10 inches high, is about the size of a brown bear's head, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nanotyrannus </PERSON> had the same advanced anatomical features as Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets that faced forward instead of sideways and a neck joint that bent downwards. The expedition that found the skull yielded other dinosaur skeletons in the musuem's collection, but no other Nanotyrannus parts. `` It's very rare to find a perfect head and no backbone or no hind leg or tail or ribs,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` It's not impossible that the body is still out there entombed in very hard sandstone.'' There are no plans to excavate the site again, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the musuem. The third scientist involved in the discovery was <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tyrrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paleontology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the skull had been on display, but not for at least the last 10 years. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Tyrannosaurus rex is the most popular dinosaur among children he gives talks to. `` I think Tyrannosaurus rex wil continue to be the favorite dinosaur, but I bet you the pygmy tyrant becomes the second most popular,'' he said.

 Students stormed two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> annex buildings and set them ablaze before they were dispersed with bullets, beatings and tear gas. At least five demonstrators were killed and 10 wounded. An Embassy spokesman reported extensive damage from Thursday night's attack, but said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were injured. Police said the crowd of more than 1,000 university students also set fire to about 25 automobiles belonging to embassy personnel that were parked near the annex complex. The students were protesting the forced extradition this week of an alleged drug trafficker suspected of involvement in the killing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent. They also voiced anger at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dispatch of additional American troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last month Private Honduran guards posted at the embassy fired shots and lobbed tear gas grenades at the demonstrators from inside the main embassy building across the street from the annex buildings, said police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the Embassy spokesman, said neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine guards nor Honduran guards stationed at the embassy complex took violent action against the protesters. He said Honduran riot police had fired on the crowd. Police identified the dead as <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Almencar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrazo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mencitta </PERSON>. They said the four men were university students and <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> was a child who had accompanied her mother to the protest. Ages were not immediately available for the dead. The riot police did not arrive at the embassy complex until nearly two hours after the demonstration began. No explanation was given for the delay. Several of the demonstrators were seen carrying pistols and students told reporters they had disarmed about 10 of the private embassy guards. Police said none of the guards were injured. All the contents of two floors of a four-story annex building housing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> offices were destroyed by the blaze and the windows of both annex buildings were shattered by the students. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said demonstrators had surged into an annex complex: `` There was a lot of damage. They burned a number of goods.'' He would not say what goods or documents were stored in the annex, and also said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were hurt. Red Cross officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in addition to those killed, 10 demonstrators were hospitalized with injuries from bullets, beatings and tear gas. The three-hour demonstration began at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, located on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. Shouting anti-U.S. slogans, the students marched seven miles to the embassy, located in an eastern district of the city. When they arrived, the demonstrators broke into two embassy annex structures, spreading gasoline inside and setting them ablaze. The demonstrators dispersed when police and army troops arrived, but regrouped and said they planned to march to President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>'s residence, located about 300 yards south of the embassy. But about 200 heavily-armed troops quickly surrounded <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s residence, stopping the demonstrators from approaching <PERSON> Lisandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON>, government press secretary, said in a national radio broadcast Thursday night that <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> regretted the incident. <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> appealed to university students for calm. The military command posted army troops throughout <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> overnight to protect government buildings. Streets were calm early today. On Tuesday, Honduran officials took <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballasteros </PERSON> from his <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> home in a pre-dawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport. <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> officials put <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on a New York-bound flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, held at the maximum-security federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for questioning in the 1985 slaying in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. Honduran legislators angrily called the incident a `` kidnapping'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> launched an investigation of the procedures used. The protesters who stormed the Embassy annex Thursday also were demonstrating against the presence of 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dispatched the troops at <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s request after a reported incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by Nicaraguan troops pursuing Contra rebels. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops later returned home.

<HEAD>Officer Who Waited for Key to Apartment at Scene of Rape Is
Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city has fired a police officer who waited outside an apartment building for a key for nearly 30 minutes while officials say a 12-year-old girl was being raped inside. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, 39, was dismissed Thursday night after a divided city commission found him guilty of violating five departmental rules. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, an officer for 14 years, said he would appeal his dismissal. `` If I could have changed it in any way, if I would have known what was going on, believe me, it would not have happened that way,'' <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> said. `` I still think I did the right thing. No one got killed.'' <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> was accused of breaking 10 department rules. The Police and Fire Commission dismissed the most serious allegation, failing to request assistance at the scene. City attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said he was shocked by dismissal of that count but pleased that <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> had been dismissed. `` Officers who have a right to carry a gun and a badge have a tremendous obligation to the public,'' <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said. `` They must meet that obligation if they wish to remain police officers. In our opinion, Officer <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> did not meet those obligations.'' <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> was found in violation of conduct unbecoming an officer, unsatisfactory performance in the line of duty, improper filing of a report, abuse of command at the scene, and violation of rules. The last means that since <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> was found in violation of any department rule, he was found in violation of that regulation as well. The disciplinary hearings began shortly after <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> and two other officers answered a report of a home invasion on Dec. 21. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> maintained he did not break into the apartment upon arriving because he feared the assailant might harm the girl and her 10-year-old brother inside. They waited outside almost 30 minutes with the girl's frantic mother for the landlord to bring a key, rather than breaking in to rescue the girl. Four officers later entered the apartment through a back door, which had been unlocked, and arrested <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> was charged with rape, burglary, home invasion and aggravated kidnapping; he is awaiting trial. The two officers who accompanied <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> also are scheduled for disciplinary hearings.

<HEAD>Women Investigated In Lesbianism Probe At Marine Base</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has carried out `` witch hunts'' for lesbians while tolerating homosexual men, says a Marine who says she is a target in a lesbianism investigation at the service's <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> boot camp. The Corps denies the accusation, although statistics show a disproportionate number of women have been dismissed for homosexuality. The <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> centers on 10 women and is likely to expand, said the woman <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, who denies being homosexual and has not been charged. Five Marine women have been charged with various counts, including committing indecent acts. Two other women who were due to go before administrative hearing boards are seeking discharges. `` Every base I've been on has had one of these so-called witch hunts,'' said the woman, a member of the Marines for six years who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` This is the only time I've know of that anyone has gone to the press.'' She said she did so `` to show there's an injustice being done.'' `` If they're going to conduct these investigations, they need to do it on the male side of the house as well,'' she said. `` It would be such an embarrassment for the men to do this,'' she said. `` They would have to admit that among the few and the proud they also have some gays in there.'' Each year, 20,000 recruits, men and women, pass through <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' only basic training base for woman Marines. There are 10,060 women in the Marines. According to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures, 90 women and 219 men have been dismissed for homosexuality in the past three federal fiscal years, although women comprise less than 5 percent of the Corps. During the same period, 662 Marine homosexuality cases were investigated, the figures show. About a third of those investigations centered on women. However, <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said lesbians do not get special attention while homosexual men are tolerated. She said there is no clear reason for the disparity and that the matter has never been studied. She said that it would be a commanding officer's responsibility to check out any reported violations of a military law. The <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> investigation is not routine, but `` it's not an unprecedented thing,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, a base spokesman. The base does n't announce such hearings, but will answer media inquiries about them, <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. He said that while records of such cases are usually kept only about two years, he understands there were similar proceedings three or four years ago. The current proceedings are Article 32 hearings, which are similar to civilian grand jury hearings. They amount to an open investigation into the allegations in which the defendants have certain rights and witnesses for both sides can be called. Following the hearing, the investigating officer makes a non-binding recommendation to the Marine's commanding officer The recommendation may be that the charges go to a court-martial, that the Marine go before an administrative discharge board or that the charges be dismissed. An administrative discharge board would determine whether the defendant has the potential for further service. A court-martial could lead to a prison sentence. In addition to committing indencent acts, the defendants face various charges, including dereliction of duty, sodomy, conspiracy to obstruct justice and assault. <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> noted that not all the charges are related to homosexuality and `` in a larger sense, we are talking about breaches of good order and discipline.'' The Corps does n't tolerate homosexuality because it is `` contrary to good order and discipline, not because there is a statement being made about lifestyles,'' he said. He added that recruit training `` must be conducted with the highest standards of order and discipline.''

 Four Israeli troops were wounded today when the army jeep they were in hit a roadside mine in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said. The spokesman said the troops were patrolling near the village of <LOCATION> Merkaba </LOCATION> in the center of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone'' when they drove by the mine. At the same time, attackers fired at the troops from a distance, the spokesman said. The troops fired back and gave chase to the attackers, who managed to flee the security zone. Two soldiers suffered light wounds and two suffered moderate wounds, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The four were evacuated to a hospital. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established its security zone, a six-to-10-mile wide strip of land north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 following a three-year occupation. The zone is patrolled by Israeli troops and Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen.

 Three children who spent two years in a tent in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> wilderness after allegedly being kidnapped by their father are back in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> with their mother. They were reunited Thursday with <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, courthouse. By evening, they were home in this town about 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I just remember my legs were shaking _ I was shaking all over,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> said, referring to the tearful reunion. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested the father, 52-year-old <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON>, as a fugitive from justice in the tiny central <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> late Wednesday. He was released from the Penobscot County Jail after posting $ 20,000 bond, a jail spokesman said. <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities began extradition proceedings after Gwinnett District Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON> said he opposed Doellefeld's release The children _ <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, 13; <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>, 11; and <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, 9 _ were dirty but in good condition. `` I was talking to <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> and she said it was like being on vacation,'' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mealor </PERSON>, the children's aunt. `` I thought many times they were dead and just not knowing was the worst,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> said. `` Are they hurt? Are they safe? Are their needs being met? At one point, it was so black. `` One night I said to myself, I've got to do something or else I am going to die,'' she said. Officials in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> was discovered after school officials recognized photographs of the children printed on an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> flier. They said <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> was teaching his children through a state-approved home tutoring program and was visited by school officials once a month. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourier </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> had been living with the children for about two years in a heavily wooded area accessible this time of year only by snowmobile or seaplanes that could land on a nearby lake. Doellefeld, a homebuilder, lived in an elaborate, well-insulated tent set up on a wooden platform, <PERSON> Fourier </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Doellefeld </PERSON> allegedly kidnapped the children from their home in August 1986, a <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted him on three counts of interference with child custody, a felony. A Gwinnett judge issued a warrant charging him with being a fugitive from justice in March 1987.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it is defying an Ethiopian government order to leave that country's war-torn northern Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> provinces, where there is drought and famine The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> asked authorities to let relief agencies continue their work in the provinces. `` Intensified fighting has made the needs of the civilian population living in conflict zones particularly urgent,'' the committee said in a statement Thursday night. `` There is now an even greater need to continue and even increase the protection and assistance activities.'' The agency has stopped virtually all relief work in the two provinces. But it's roughly 25 delegates are staying in the area in hopes the Marxist government will revise its stand, committee official <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Peduzzi </PERSON> said. The agency said it is committed to uphold its mandate as a neutral intermediary in conflict areas, citing a `` humanitarian responsibility for the fate of some 5 million people'' in the two provinces. Children are showing very high levels of malnutrition, the statement said. The Ethiopian government told international relief agencies Wednesday to recall all foreign workers from <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> for security reasons. President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> said last week that government troops are mobilizing to crush a long-standing rebellion in region.

 The government-controlled media blamed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today for a car bombing that seriously injured a white member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> denied responsibility. <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a South African lawyer, remained in a <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> hospital after the Thursday morning explosion that occurred as he entered his car outside his apartment in downtown <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. Sachs was jailed by South African authorities for more than three months without charge in 1963. He also defended members of the congress. The congress, banned in 1960, is the major guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. He has lived in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> for 10 years and works at the country's <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. `` The long and criminal arm of the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> regime has again reached into <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> to carrry out another savage and odious crime,'' said <PERSON> Noticias </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> daily. `` Sachs committed what is, in the eyes of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the greatest of all crimes: he frontally opposed apartheid, he openly challenged the racist regime,'' the front-page editorial added. Reports on Mozambican radio and television also blamed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the national news agency AIM reported. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government-run television quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as saying that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` could not be held responsible for the conflict in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and certainly not for violence which emanated from faction fighting in the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.'' None of the Mozambican reports cited any evidence linking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to the blast, but they noted a recent series of attacks carried out against <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members. At least six congress members have been killed in countries outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has denied responsibility for the deaths, although it repeatedly warns it will cross its borders in pursuit of members. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, a political scientist at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on the congress, said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was a member, but that he was not actively working for the group in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and was not an officer in the organization, which is composed mainly of blacks. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> condemned the attack and said, `` We note that the incident takes place after several recent attacks against purported members of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> signed a mutual non-aggression pact in 1984, but both sidely regularly accuse the other of violations. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, born in 1935, was the son of a prominent trade unionist. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was one of the few whites who participated in the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' defiance campaign that led to the organization's banning in 1960 The campaign urged people to ignore apartheid laws, resulting in thousands of arrests. After being released from detention in 1963, <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> wrote a book about his experiences, `` The Prison Diary of <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>,'' which was turned into a stage play in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He worked in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. As an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, he had just begun drafting a new family law for <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, AIM said. The explosion shattered windows in the nearby <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and hurled pieces of the car as much as 50 yards away, AIM reported. By law and custom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Police patrolling gang-infested neighborhoods awash in drugs, bullets and blood are preparing to saturate the streets of the nation's second-largest city in a declared war on violence. `` We're putting together a task force to suppress gang activity in the city wherever it's at,'' officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frio </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said Thursday. `` We are not going to broadcast how and when we're going to do it.'' `` We're out there to let these gang-bangers know that we're here, we're not going to go away, and this city belongs to the good people,'' said Detective <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celli </PERSON>, using the street slang for gang member In recent weeks police have arrested hundreds of gang members, most plying a burgeoning drug trade and enforcing the perimeters of their `` turf'' with drive-by shootings. Gangs were blamed for 387 killings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1987, and as many as 85 so far this year. Violence has continued despite recent enforcement sweeps, with five people wounded Wednesday in three drive-by shootings, a common style of attack in gang wars. The anticipated roundup, involving as many to 1,000 police officers, would be the biggest in a series of mass patrols in gang-ridden areas south of downtown. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said Thursday that he would send the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and possibly even the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help local authorities control gang violence if asked to do so by local officials. County Supervisor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> asking that the Guard be sent to ride with police officers as a show of force. Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who has compared the violence to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has won the unprecedented support of politicians fed up with gang activity. Earlier this week, the city finance committee vote 3-0 to approve a police request for $ 2.5 million to cover overtime for the gang sweeps. Approval by the full <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> appears certain on Tuesday. The council also has approved a request for $ 16 million to hire 400 police officers, largely because of complaints from residents of poor neighborhoods that they were n't getting enough police protection. And a private group, <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gangs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communities </ORGANIZATION>, has been formed to fight gangs. It plans to push for anti-gang legislation, to help pay for the funerals of innocent victims of gang wars and to keep the issue before the public in the style of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Police provided few details on plans for a sweep that could be launched this weekend, refusing to elaborate on Gates' promise to flood the low-income and working-class neighborhoods south of downtown with blue uniforms. Incensed by the Good Friday gang shooting that killed one person and injured 12 _ none believed to be gang members _ <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said he'd deploy 1,000 officers drawn from across the city and working on overtime In previous sweeps, officers have cruised the streets, concentrating on street-corner drug markets and stopping people wearing gang colors. On Wednesday and Thursday, police arrested 210 people for misdemeanors, felonies and outstanding warrants, and 128 of those arrested were alleged gang members. Gangs, including the violent Crips and the Bloods which have spread their activities to cities nationwide, have long been active in the inner city, and police statistics show no dramatic increase in the level of violence. But authorities say traditional turf battles are giving way to drug-dealing wars here and throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> as </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs try to control distribution of `` crack,'' the smokeable form of cocaine. Warring gangs, said Councilman <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON>, are creating `` homicide that's worse than <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 U.S.-supported rebels have agreed to resume high-level talks with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government to end a nearly 7-year-old civil war, but said several conditions must be fulfilled first. The directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance said Thursday in a letter that it had agreed to come to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> April 15 for the talks, the first since leaders of the two sides agreed to a cease-fire plan on March 23. The second meeting had been scheduled for April 6, but the Contras said they were postponing it because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had failed to fully comply with provisions of the cease-fire agreement signed in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, head of the government delegation and the brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, had offered to hold the negotiations either April 9 or April 15. Spokesmen for the rebels, known as Contras, charged the government withheld newsprint from the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, violating the accord's provision for full press freedom in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The government also failed to include all the prisoners the Contras had asked for when it released 100 political prisoners on April 1, as called for under the agreement, the Contras said. In Thursday's letter to <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, rebel leaders accepted as an `` involuntary error'' the failure to release all of the requested political prisoners. It said the government lacked enough time to arrange for all of the requested names to be released. Sandinista and Contra military delegations were to continue talks today on technical details of providing humanitarian aid to the rebels and controlling zones where the insurgents are to gather during a 60-day cease-fire that began on April 1. On Thursday, the delegations finished defining exact locations of the seven rebel zones and began considering a 34-point rebel plan governing conduct in those zones, said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Jaoquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON>, head of the Sandinista military delegation. `` We already have discharged an important part of the agenda, which was the point on localization'' of the zones, <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> said after Thursday's session in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> said the government had not formally responded to the 34-point plan presented by the Contras outlining rebel conduct inside the zones. But he said the plan `` has several positive points, that perfectly can be considered by the government.'' The March 23 accord does not specify if and under what conditions the Contras are to lay down their arms. Contra leaders have vowed not to. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Urroz </PERSON>, a member of the rebel military delegation, called for complete Contra autonomy in the zones. `` What we want is that in the zones we have real control,'' <PERSON> Urroz </PERSON> said, adding the rebels were seeking `` security, integrity and communications without interference'' from the government. Still unresolved were pledges of security for the Contras, how they would receive food and other supplies, who would control the areas and how compliance would be verified. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> announced his government was prepared to administer a portion of a $ 48 million humanitarian aid package for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month to treat Nicaraguan children injured in the civil war. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> rejected as `` illegal'' plans to have the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> administer the aid, including assistance for the Contras. The Sapoa accord calls for a neutral party to administer any outside humanitarian aid for the Contras. `` We can never neglect our aid to the children victims of the war. It is a matter of a humanitarian gesture and I will try to do it,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> received the Nobel Peace Prize in December for authoring the regional peace plan signed by <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s five presidents on Aug. 7.

After the meeting, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> April </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasbie </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> desk in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will go to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to continue the American mediation. Ms. <PERSON> Glasbie </PERSON> is now in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> holding talks with <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> leaders. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said his talk with <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> was `` productive,'' but he gave no details. After the meeting, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the army helicopter which brought him on the 100-mile flight to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He made no statement. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters before leaving <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, that stability in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would be `` a great advantage in our efforts against terrorism'' in seeking the release of nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said a new division of power among the competing factions would help all countries in the area, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> itself. `` We want to see an election go off successfully'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, referring to presidential balloting which must be held by September, when <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expires. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, has sought for nearly six years to gain control of his country. But <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s more powerful neighbor to the east, plays a dominant role in Lebanese politics. A new distribution of political power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could reduce <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military presence there, which is becoming an economic drain on <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Whether it would help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other hostages is not clear, although a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also talked to Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> about their plight. Many of the 22 foreign hostages are believed held by an Iranian-influenced group, possibly beyond the reach of <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> power, although <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has close ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The longest-held hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. An administration source said Thursday in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is vacationing, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> expressing concern about the continuing conflict in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The official said he had not seen the letter, but `` I would characterize it as underscoring the mutual interests that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have in building peace in the region.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` serving as a postman between <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>,'' who have not spoken to each other in over a year. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. The aim of a new Lebanese constitution would be to modify the `` national pact'' devised in 1943 that allocated the top positions in the government to specific religious groups. The president is a Christian, the premier is a Sunni Moslem and the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is a Shiite Moslem. In the ensuing 45 years, Moslems overtook Christians as a majority and demanded a larger role. If the diplomatic effort succeeds, it will mark a turnabout in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s fortunes in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Five years ago, he thought he had worked out an agreement between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the two to cooperate economically, politically and diplomatically. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> undercut the accord and it fell apart. In the meantime, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> increased its power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, near the Israeli border, the situation is especially unstable. Palestinians fought with the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement while <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian-linked group, was suspected of kidnappings and hijackings. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which drove to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a 1982 invasion, is arming the Christian-led <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia and occupies a strip of land north of its border. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in 1986 of promoting terrorism. He ordered <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> to withdraw, barred high-level meetings with Syrian officials, stopped sales of high technology and imposed other sanctions. Last September, <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> was sent back to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and most of the sanctions quietly disappeared. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> twice last month and returned again Tuesday. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> is an outspoken supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s having a separate seat at proposed <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan would exclude the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and seat <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as part of a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> also demands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, a security belt <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> lost in the 1967 Six-Day War that now serves as a buffer to protect northern Israeli villages from a resumption of bombardment from across the border.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Election Day Announced, Official Campaign Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliamentary campaigning officially began today, and the government set <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections for April 26. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called for fair and orderly elections and warned against any illegal campaigning. The elections will be the first time in 17 years that just one lawmaker is being elected from each district. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, elected Dec. 16, is seeking a majority in the one-house legislature. Division among opposition parties may give the governing party the edge. Candidates immediately began to register with the committee. About 1,300 candidates were expected to register by the Wednesday deadline. Some campaigning already has begun, with posters going up in many places and politicians taking advantage of various gatherings to attack the opposing side. Under a new constitution that took effect Feb. 25 aimed at democratic reform, 224 lawmakers will be elected to four-year terms from single-member districts. An additional 75 seats will be decided under a bonus system based on the parties' nationwide polling strength. In recent elections, two lawmakers were elected from each district, but that system has been scrapped in response to public criticism that voters' wishes were not truly represented when the first runners-up were elected too. The governing party is hoping for a total of 163 seats in the direct voting, giving it 55 percent of the 299 assembly seats. In the presidential elections on Dec. 16, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won with just 36.6 percent of the vote. Main opposition leaders <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> received 55 percent of the vote, but split it between them. The main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, aims at 80 seats in the direct voting. Other opposition groups, like <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, also have urged voters to give the opposition enough assembly seats to allow it to effectively check the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration. The two Kims and other opposition politicians charge that the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration is an extension of the preceding government of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who left office Feb. 25 after a seven-year term. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was arrested last week on charges of embezzling more than $ 10 million, influence peddling and tax evasion while heading Saemaul Undong -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a semi-official rural and urban development program. The arrest was seen as a move by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to distance himself from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> has accused former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> of amassing a fortune while in office and illegally taking huge sums of money out of the country to invest in foreign stock, land and other real estate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The former president, now traveling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has yet to respond to the charges.

<HEAD>Smog-Covered Soviet City Site of Mass Anti-Pollution Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 10,000 residents of an industrial city in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> staged a street demonstration to protest smog that has burned skin and caused lung and heart problems, a newspaper reported. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, the daily of the youth organization <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION>, said the protesters in the city of <PERSON> Nizhny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagil </PERSON> demanded that two 45-year-old coke-burning furnaces at a steel plant be closed. `` Who will answer for the 54 stillborn children in 1987?'' a crying woman said at the demonstration. <PERSON> Komsomolskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravda </PERSON> did not say when the protest occurred in the city of 405,000 people 900 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but it appeared to have been in February or March. There have been several reports of environmental protests in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power three years ago and encouraged freer expression. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, in an article published Wednesday, said the government lists <PERSON> Nizhny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagil </PERSON> among the 50 Soviet cities whose pollution level exceeds sanitary standards. Smog is common in the city, and in the morning, the faces of children on the way to kindergarten burn, the newspaper said. One doctor said the number of children hospitalized for serious lung and heart ailments caused by pollution had risen by 33 percent. He did n't say over what period. A commission of the Presidium of the Russian republic's Council of Ministers, the republic's highest governmental body, ordered the two coke-burning furnaces at the <ORGANIZATION> Nizhny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tagil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> closed last September because of excessive pollution, the newspaper said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferrous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgy </ORGANIZATION> decided to keep the furnaces open until new, cleaner furnaces were completed. The complex, which includes plants that build railroad cars and boilers, and a cement factory, spews out 629,000 tons of harmful substances a year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>. The health problems led to what <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> called `` an explosion in public consciousness.'' Children sent the top party official of the metallurgical complex drawings of `` smokestacks, smog enveloping living areas and the handwritten words: ` I do n't want to die!''' After the demonstration, the minister of ferrous metallurgy ordered one of the two coke furnaces stopped, but the other `` continues to pollute the city,'' the newspaper said. A petition signed by 8,500 <PERSON> Nizhny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagil </PERSON> residents demanding further action has been sent to the national <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 A former top aide to impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has been convicted of theft by extortion for threatening a parole board member to get him to support a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> appointee. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, 59, a former five-term congressman, was found guilty Thursday by a <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that deliberated for 3 -LCB- hours. Neither <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> nor his attorney, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON>, would say whether they planned an appeal. `` We'll take it one step at a time,'' <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> said. `` It's safe to say I'm not real pleased,'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was found guilty of threatening to withhold permission for <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a member of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles, to work as a part-time <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> justice of the peace, and threatening to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain executive director <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> appointee. Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinstein </PERSON> scheduled a May 6 sentencing for <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who faces up to five years in prison. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> is free on his own recognizance. `` We do n't take joy in a conviction, but we feel it was a fair trial,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general. `` We felt it was a just verdict.'' Jury foreman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the deciding factor behind the verdict was `` the tapes of the phone call between <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> at home from the office of the state attorney general, who recorded the call. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the jurors had no difficulty reaching a verdict. `` We listened to all the tapes and examined all the evidence again, but it was unanimous,'' he said. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, asked what he'd do differently, said: `` I'd have probably hung up on <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> when he called me at home.'' Reached shortly after the verdict was announced, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, `` I'm sad to hear it. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> meant no harm to anybody, and I'm sorry to hear it.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office Monday when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two impeachment charges. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> denied on the stand Monday that he threatened <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> or told him how he should vote. But the state alleged that <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> followed up on the alleged threat in a letter and a telephone conversation after <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> voted with the board majority to seek Ms. <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>'s resignation on grounds of low staff morale. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> testified that he did suggest that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> should back Ms. <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> but denied that he tried to `` steal'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s vote by threatening his job. He acknowledged lying to an attorney general's investigator when he originally denied making the threat. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to run unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a widening lead over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> two weeks before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary, a poll indicated today. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> said 47 percent of likely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters picked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; 31 percent backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 6 percent chose <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. An additional 8 percent said they would vote for an `` uncommitted'' slate of delegates that hopes to draft <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> for the nomination at the national convention. The primary is April 19. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who put his campaign into mothballs on Thursday, was supported by 2 percent of the Democrats surveyed and 6 percent said they were undecided. The margin of error for the poll, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, was 5 percentage points. In a similar poll conducted in mid-March by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> pollsters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 37 percent of the Democrats; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 28 percent; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 5 percent; uncommitted was at 10 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was at 4 percent; and 13 percent said they were undecided. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to be doing best in the suburban counties surrounding <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was running about even with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support among white voters remained at about 14 percent in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll, the same as in the mid-March poll. Among Jewish voters, who make up about 25 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary voters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 68 percent of those surveyed; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was at 10 percent; and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 9 percent. In the mid-March poll, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 60 percent of the likely Jewish voters; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was at 9 percent; and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was at 4 percent. The race appeared to be a bit tighter when only Democrats who said they were `` very likely'' to vote in the primary were questioned, said <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, Among that group _ which could be important if there is a low voter turnout _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at 42 percent; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 34 percent; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 8 percent; uncommitted at 8 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 2 percent; and 6 percent said they were undecided. Regarding <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, 46 percent of those Democrats surveyed said the governor should run for president, down from 59 percent in mid-March, while 16 percent said they expected him to eventually run, down from 24 percent. With <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declining to endorse any of the candidates, the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> pollsters also asked Democrats if <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> should endorse someone before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. Almost 31 percent said the governor should endorse, 25 percent said he should n't and 43 percent said it did n't make any difference to them what <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> did. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said he does n't want to be a candidate, but has refused to rule out accepting a draft if there is a deadlocked national convention.

 An attempted coup attempt last month against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> failed ignominiously when an officer loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> locked the plotters inside an arsenal, a newspaper reported today. Citing unidentified senior administration officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that the failure of the allegedly U.S.-backed coup has left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-Noriega plans in chaos The newspaper said several anti-Noriega members of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> went to the Central American nation's main arsenal in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last month to obtain guns for the attempt, pretending to be on official military business. The guard commander at the arsenal, however, locked the plotters inside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was in progress, the newspaper reported. Swift action by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters put down the conspiracy and resulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen anti-Noriega officers during the last several weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a well-placed military expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates `` the depth to which the administration planners have underestimated <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and misunderstood the situation there.''

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired four missiles into Iranian cities today hours before Iranians cast ballots in important parliamentary elections. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> retaliated by shooting two missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, another two into the northern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> and one into <LOCATION> al-Amarah </LOCATION> farther south, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> confirmed one of the strikes on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and said civilians were killed. It also said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> civilians were killed when Iranian long-range artillery shelled Iraqi border cities. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said there was a loud explosion before dawn near the city's railway station. The Iraqi agency said the missiles were fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>. Both news agencies were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. It also said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes Thursday night raided a `` large maritime target,'' which usually means an oil tanker. There was no immediate confirmation from <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shipping sources. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said missiles landed in residential areas of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>. It gave no casualty toll. It also said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes raided several Iranian cities, but gave no further details. The Iranian agency said Iranian planes bombed military targets in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but the Iraqi agency said the planes bombed residential neighborhoods in the northern city of <LOCATION> Amadiya </LOCATION>, killing civilians. Iranians went to the polls to elect 270 members of the Majlis, or parliament, balloting that was expected to increase the power of radicals who want economic changes such as land reforms, a minimum wage and policies that favor the poor. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its warplanes sneaked through Iraqi radar into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and bombed a military base and oil refinery, killing or wounding dozens of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers. It was the first reported bombing of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital in three years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied the city was hit Thursday, but the ferocity of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks later gave some credence to the Iranian claims. Both sides bombarded each other's cities and towns Thursday with missiles and reported scores of civilian casualties. Also Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to investigate Iraqi allegations <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in a March 30-31 battle in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons in the same battle.

<TEXT>
 In the end, the four-year corporate war that forced oil giant <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy and the largest civil award in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history came down to a silent, 10-minute electronic payment of $ 3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. The transfer settling <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> took place Thursday in a high-security room at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank-Houston </ORGANIZATION> _ and, coincidentally, halfway between <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and the Texaco Building. As a half-dozen tight-lipped bank and <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> executives watched, a green computer screen signaled the arrival of four <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> payments, starting at 10:03 a.m. and ending at 10:13 a.m.. About a dozen reporters and photographers watched The transfer had to be broken down into four payments, since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> can transfer amounts only as high as one cent short of $ 1 billion. When the transfer was complete, a few people applauded. `` We're all very glad it's all over,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> assistant treasurer. `` Quite frankly, we've been in a holding pattern for over four years,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said later Thursday. `` We think we're now in a position to invest these funds and to make up for lost time,'' <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said. The settlement of the suit, which stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, allowed the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company to emerge from bankruptcy protection. It was part of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization plan, which a federal judge approved March 23. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> also will begin paying $ 2.6 billion to other creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, looking for long-term ways to invest the windfall, actually borrowed $ 3 billion a couple of weeks ago so it could begin investing it in an orderly manner, spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. The war began with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, claiming interference with a planned merger between <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Getty </LOCATION>. In November 1985, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury shocked <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> by agreeing with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> and awarding the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> company $ 10.53 billion in damages, the largest civil award in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. A state appeals court upheld the verdict, but reduced the $ 3 billion in punitive damages to $ 1 billion. Nearly a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it had to do so to avoid posting a potentially ruinous appeal bond. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal and let the verdict stand <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> then said it was going to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but a committee of shareholders proposed the settlement. The premise of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s case was that a handshake and a person's word was as good as a written contract, and that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> violated that rule by plucking <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s grasp. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> contended <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> had invited it to bid and that there was no valid contract between <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> because all the papers had not been signed by the appropriate parties. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> also put <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' court system under scrutiny, challenging the trial judge's credentials and complaining that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges were influenced by large campaign contributions from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> case. Although he was delighted to settle the case, <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said the outcome probably was not as good for <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> as gaining <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> would have been. `` I do n't think that -LRB- $ 3 billion -RRB- in any way replaces totally the loss the company has suffered. But it remains to be seen how astutely these funds are reinvested and perhaps we can make up for lost ground,'' he said. Attorney's fees, including <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON>'s, come to about $ 400 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON> declined to reveal his share. `` I'll spend -LRB- the money -RRB- on the important things like whiskey and women,'' he said, smiling. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials had no comment on the payment. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> also announced Thursday that its board adopted a new anti-takeover defense, a preferred stock purchase rights plan, to replace a similar `` poison pill'' put in place after the jury made its award. The old plan was designed to block a corporate raider from appropriating the benefits of the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> case before it had been resolved, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. The new plan also was designed to protect <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> from `` unfair or coercive actions by opportunistic parties'' and give <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> time to make acquisitions using the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> money, <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Key Step In Activation Of AIDS Virus Discovered By Scientists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The AIDS virus must make a precise change in its protein coat before it can infect cells, and drugs that can block that change might be able to prevent AIDS infections, researchers say in a study published today. The researchers, from the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said they do n't know whether such drugs could be developed in a form that could make tham safe and effective for use in humans. The scientists discovered that the AIDS virus, a piece of genetic material housed in a complex envelope of fats and proteins, can infect cells only if its outer envelope protein is clipped into two pieces. If this cleavage does n't occur, the virus particles assemble and appear normal but are disarmed and unable to infect new cells, said the leader of the study, Dr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>, who works in the lab of Dr. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, professor of pathology at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s School of Medicine. The results appear today in the journal Cell. The scientists demonstrated their findings by constructing a mutant strain of the AIDS virus that could not complete the critical step. They found it was unable to enter and infect human cells in tissue culture. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has struck 58,270 people since June 1981, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> reported this week. The disease has killed 32,545. The researchers believe the cleavage step is critical to the virus' infectivity because it makes the virus' envelope protein `` sticky,'' which allows it to fuse to the membrane of a cell it seeks to infect. After the virus has fused to the cell's membrane, it can enter the cell and remain hidden from the body's immune system, reproduce and eventually begin to spread infection throughout the body. The scientists believe that if they can prevent the AIDS virus from sticking to cells, they might be able to suppress infection. The study was sponsored by grants from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Death Penalty, Wiretap Bills Advance In Political Shenanigans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER KERR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state Assembly has approved a bill to allow the death penalty for people who kill children and set the stage for a vote next week on a wiretap measure aimed at drug dealers. Both votes were considered defeats for Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and were led by minority Republicans and the so-called Gang of Five, dissident Democrats opposed to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The votes came during a five-hour floor session Thursday marked by closed-door party caucuses, numerous small floor huddles and a constant undercurrent of rumors that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> might soon be ousted by the 36 Republicans teaming with the Gang of Five. It takes 41 votes to elect or remove a speaker in the 80-member Assembly. The two anti-crime bills had been stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The death penalty bill was killed by that committee on March 21. On Monday, Republicans and the Gang of Five combined to withdraw it from committee, on a 41-30 vote, the first such successful withdrawal motion in 28 years. Such motions are considered a challenge to the authority of the speaker, who appoints committee members. The bill would make child murder a special circumstance qualifying a murderer for the death sentence, along with such other specified crimes as murder of a police office or elected official, or murder committed during a felony. The bill was approved 62-7 after a long and emotional debate and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The original wiretap bill was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last June and has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since then. Supporters could not try to withdraw that bill because it had n't been rejected by the committee, so instead they took an unrelated bill introduced by the same lawmaker, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, that was already on the floor and with his permission voted 48-13 to amend it by adding the wiretap measure The amended bill is scheduled for a floor vote next Thursday. The bill would allow police with approval of the attorney general or a district attorney to petition a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a wiretap authorization. The police would have to show that it was likely that a drug possession or sale offense had been or would be committed.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 32 In Sting Operation At Seized `Crack House'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police raided and seized a house where crack was sold and operated it themselves for seven hours in a sting operation in which 32 people were arrested, officers say. The arrests were a new strategy aimed at sowing fear among crack users, said Capt. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Armand </PERSON>, head of the city police narcotic squad. `` You always go after the top people selling the drugs, but now we're attacking the demand factor,'' <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> said. `` We're probably going to do this again. It was very successful.'' During the operation Wednesday night and early Thursday, officers were leading people they had arrested out the front door of the house while new customers were coming in the back, he said. At times, officers said, people were lined up at the back door and as many as six customer cars lined the curb while police hurriedly packaged the crack form of cocaine in plastic bags. Several female customers left children, including one less than a year old, in their cars while they went inside to purchase crack, officers said. Officers said customers continued to enter the house even after a woman reported on a citizens band radio that police had taken over the house. `` We turned away twice as many -LRB- suspects -RRB- as we arrested,'' <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> said. `` They will go to any lengths to get drugs.'' People were arrested on investigative charges of possession of a controlled substance.

 An autopsy of an Israeli girl killed in a clash with Palestinians found that she was struck in the head by a bullet and a large object and cast doubts on army reports that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> stoned her to death. Details provided by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television and radio raised the possibility that 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was shot accidentally by one of the guards accompanying teen-age Jewish settlers on a holiday hike in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Two Arabs were killed and two were wounded in the incident Wednesday in the village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. Today, two Palestinians were shot and wounded in separate clashes with troops in anti-occupation unrest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. On <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, several dozen Palestinians shouted nationalist slogans after noon prayers on the Moslem Sabbath. Demonstrators dispersed quickly after about 10 border policemen approached. It remained unclear how <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was killed. The army first said she and the two Arabs were shot to death. It later said <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was stoned to death by villagers. An army official, citing autopsy results, then said <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was struck in the head by both a bullet and a large object, possibly a stone. The official said the cause of death was not yet known and that investigators did not know from which weapon the bullet was fired. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a military source, said the bullet was fired from one of the two guards' M-16 rifles but that it was n't known who pulled the trigger. The source also was quoted as saying that when <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> wrested the guns away from the Israeli guards, they probably were already empty. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted an army report as saying that <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> also was struck in the head by a rock hurled by the mother and sister of one of the Arabs killed. The two women were arrested, the report said. The next day, the army blew up five homes of <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> allegedly involved in the clash and rounded up hundreds of Arabs for questioning. Soldiers fatally shot an Arab youth who the army said ignored orders to stop. <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON>, the first Israeli civilian killed in four months of unrest in the occupied territories, was buried near her home in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 141 Arabs and one Israeli soldier have died. The girl's death increased tension between the 1.5 million Palestinians and the 65,000 Jewish settlers living the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. On Thursday, armed Israeli civilians beat residents, broke windows and fired shots into the air in two villages near <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, citing army investigators, said Wednesday's violence began after a group of 16 teen-agers from <ORGANIZATION> Elon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moreh </ORGANIZATION>, accompanied by two armed guards, were stoned by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths as they hiked near <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> The two guards disagreed over what to do next, the radio report said. One of the guards, <PERSON> Romam </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>, 26, wanted to open fire, but the second guard, <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON>, 55, asked him not to, according to the report. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> then told the children to gather around him to serve as a barrier, and started shooting, the radio report said. The Arab youths eventually disarmed him and took the Israelis to <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, where they were attacked by villagers, the report said. Thirteen Israelis were wounded in the clash. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports have identified <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> as an extreme religious nationalist and a follower of the anti-Arab Kach movement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>. Last year, the army barred <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> from entering the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> for three months after he repeatedly sought confrontations with Arabs over prayer rights at a site in the city, which is holy to both Arabs and Jews. The army's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Armram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> that `` hundreds'' of <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> villagers played a role in Wednesday's clash. However, army officials also have said many villagers helped the teen-agers, hiding some in their homes and calling ambulances. <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> remained under curfew as soldiers searched for residents, many of whom had fled to nearby ravines and neighboring villages. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said the army distributed leaflets in the area calling on <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> residents to surrender.

<TEXT>
 An executive of a second magazine has echoed a complaint that this year's Pulitzer Prize to a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer reporter should be reconsidered because the winning entry did not break new ground. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s magazine publisher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> said Thursday he agreed with the contention of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> weekly, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, that the series on secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending by <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> leaned heavily on information another reporter published in the two magazines. The formal complaint of the Journal will be discussed by the executive committee of the Pulitzer board and some kind of judgment should be made by next week, the board's secretary, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, said. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> added that `` breaking new ground'' is not a requirement for winning the national reporting prize. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to the board that <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s series was built on an earlier story in the Journal by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> and `` plows no new journalistic ground.'' <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s stories were accompanied by an annotated document similar to a feature <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> did for the January 1987 issue of <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s. `` It does n't seem quite right that the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> gets a Pulitzer Prize unless originality has nothing to do with prize giving these days,'' <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone call to The Associated Press. He said he did not plan to write the Pulitzer board. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said only he and the board chairman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, had seen the complaint, but copies were being circulated to the half dozen members of the executive committee. <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said the magazine checked with him before protesting. <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON> said he told the Journal to go ahead if it felt strongly about the issue. He said his acquiescence did not necessarily mean he agreed with its position. Another board member, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the Inquirer's executive editor, said his only role in the review would be to respond to the Journal's complaint and answer questions of other board members

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> is a man of contradictions. Born and raised in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, he has the accent and manners of a British gentleman. A published biographer and <ORGANIZATION> Guggenheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> fellow, he wears natty suits from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Perhaps the biggest contradiction, however, is whether he is a scholarly collector of rare documents or a thief. Today a jury will be asked to decide if he is a scholarly collector of rare documents or a thief. Closing arguments were expected to be completed by midday, with jury deliberation to follow. Mount is charged with interstate transportation of stolen goods, letters and documents he allegedly stole from the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. The charge carries a possible sentence of 10 years in prison and $ 500,000. Mount's friends say the charges are unbelievable. His lawyer says they are unprovable. `` I do n't think he could have done it psychologically,'' said <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Manship </PERSON>, who testified for <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> during his three-week trial. `` He has too much respect for history and scholarship to steal from archives.'' An engaging man with a sharp wit and piercing blue eyes, <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> contends he has been reduced to poverty since the government seized his savings. He was evicted from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> boarding house and has stayed at a YMCA during the trial. The court rejected his pleas for money to bring witnesses over from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who he claims can prove his ownership of the documents. `` I'm not allowed witnesses,'' he said. `` It's not a trial.'' Mount is charged with selling a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bookshop letters written by artist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> that belonged to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He was arrested while allegedly trying to sell letters and documents signed by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and various Civil War generals that had been taken from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. Mount has not been charged with theft, but Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in the trial's opening arguments that it is the government's contention that <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> took the papers. The prosecution presented testimony establishing that <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> had access to the documents in May and July 1987. Mount testified he bought the <LOCATION> Whistler </LOCATION> papers at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> shops in the 50s and 60s and received the Civil War papers from an Irish parish priest in 1961 who gave him the documents in a biscuit tin. The priest has since died. The defense also has noted that Mount has over the years donated many of his papers to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Why would I steal from my own heirs?'' Mount asked. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>'s public defender, has attacked the government's case as a `` shoddy arrest not justified by any kind of investigative effort.'' `` They never had definitive word from the institutions that the letters were missing from their files,'' he said. The defense's case has largely rested on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>'s testimony and the prosecution has raised questions about his background. At the time of his arrest in August, the government revealed <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchow </PERSON> 59 years ago in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and once was charged with making false statements in a passport application. Mount freely admits he is `` a product of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>,'' and attributes his accent to his Irish neighbors. His conviction on the passport charge was reversed on appeal. Mount has been recognized for his work as an artist and writer. He has written well-received biographies of painters <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>. He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1956. But <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> frets his reputation has been destroyed by the case no matter what the verdict. `` To be charged with something of a sleazy nature at this time in my life, it's a disgrace,'' he said.

 A day after lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> challenged federal prosecutors to `` put up or shut up,'' a potentially key witness for <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s labor racketeering and embezzlement trial entered a guilty plea. <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 46, appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and pleaded guilty Thursday to being a `` ghost employee'' of Teamsters Local 507 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> from 1972 to 1978. He was paid about $ 109,000 without doing any work for the local, of which <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was secretary-treasurer. The guilty pleas put in effect an agreement that requires <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> to testify as a government witness. The judge deferred sentencing and said that <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON>'s cooperation with government prosecutors would be considered when sentencing eventually occurs. <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON>'s plea came as <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s lawyers were seeking to have White dismiss all charges _ labor racketeering, embezzlement and falsifying documents _ against the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> boss. In documents filed with the court Wednesday, defense lawyers alleged that an internal memo to former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> showed that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> knew that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was authorized to hire <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> and others who did no work. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s role as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant has been confirmed repeatedly in various legal proceedings. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s defense team stated: `` If authorization existed, then no crime was committed ... but now when the proceedings have reached the appropriate juncture for -LRB- prosecutors -RRB- to come forward with its evidence and, in effect, ` put up or shut up,' it fails to ` put up' anything.'' <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s trial is scheduled to begin July 12.

<HEAD>Four Separate Flu Variations Floating Around U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dominant type of flu this season has evolved into four separate variations, complicating the task of developing the proper vaccine for next winter, federal health officials say. Deaths from influenza and pneumonia have exceeded the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s statistical `` epidemic threshold'' for the past seven weeks. That figure is one indicator that the flu season remains under way _ although the agency does not attempt to tabulate the specific numbers of Americans dying from flu. Data is collected from 121 cities but the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> does not attempt to project a national figure. Although the 1987-1988 flu season is winding down, some activity continues, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> reported `` widespread'' flu outbreaks last week _ covering areas including more than half the population. Eight other states _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ reported less severe `` regional'' outbreaks. The type A-H3N2 flu prevalent this season has long been associated with `` excess mortality,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Late last year, when the influenza season got under way, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> saw evidence of an apparent `` drift'' in the type A-H3N2, one of three major types of flu. The A-H3N2 virus, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said at the time, was `` drifting'' away from the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> flu, the A-H3N2 strain the 1987-1988 flu vaccine was designed to stop, and toward a somewhat different form. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday in its weekly report it has now identified four different variants of A-H3N2 flu virus circulating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent months; they are known as the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> flu, the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> flu, the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> flu and the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> flu. The 1987-88 vaccine did not protect patients against the various A-H3N2 viruses `` as well as it could have against -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> -LRB- flu -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON>, a researcher with the influenza branch. The four different viruses present a problem for immunization experts, Ms. <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON> said. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Immunization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> each year recommends which flu types the next winter's vaccine should protect against, and which specific strains of those types should be targeted The reports of the four different A-H3N2 strains circulating this past winter `` will be used in deciding which H3N2 antigen to use'' in next winter's vaccine, Ms. <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON> said. A flu vaccine ca n't protect optimally against four different flu viruses belonging to the same type, she said. Instead, vaccine experts will try to determine which virus to target, and how much protection that vaccine might offer against closely related viruses. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu.

<HEAD>Energy-Efficient Buildings May Pose Health Risk, Researchers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Poor indoor air quality caused by energy-efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems is a serious health problem that may be aggravated by ignorance among contractors, says an industry spokesman commenting on a study released today. The study found that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> trainees housed in modern barracks were about 50 percent more likely to contract a respiratory infection during basic training than those who stayed in older, better ventilated buildings. The study examined the incidence of influenza and other respiratory illnesses among about 400,000 trainees at four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> training centers from October 1982 to September 1986. The study says the findings may apply to office buildings and other structures designed for maximum energy efficiency. `` In tight buildings with closed ventilation systems, airborne-transmitted pathogens are not only recirculated and concentrated but also efficiently dispersed through indoor living spaces,'' the researchers wrote in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, in ` leaky'' older buildings, `` airborne-transmitted agents are diluted by fresh, outdoor air and -LRB- are -RRB- relatively quickly exhausted from indoor spaces,'' said the researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insitute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It is a serious problem, and there's a lot of talk about it ... but it does n't seem like too many people are doing too many things to correct it. Maybe it's because they do n't know what to do to correct it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevirt </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Sheet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conditioning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` As soon as you take in additional ventilation, you're losing more energy ... and so it's a trade-off'' between energy efficiency and air quality, he said in a telephone interview Thursday. Although there are modern ventilation systems that offer energy efficiency as well as improved air quality, they tend to be more expensive and many contractors may not know about them, <PERSON> Bevirt </PERSON> said. His association is putting together a manual for its members worldwide that includes information on how to test air quality and what can be done to maximize it while offering energy efficiency as well, he said. Most office buildings and other structures built during the energy-conscious 1970s feature tight insulation and ventilation systems designed to keep outside air outside, <PERSON> Bevirt </PERSON> said. In such buildings, `` Up to 95 percent of the air in the building is recirculated,'' exposing occupants to used air that may be filled with viruses and other contaminants, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> institute. The <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> study was not the first to examine the so-called `` sick building syndrome,'' but it covered a larger population over a longer time period, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. The researchers, led by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON>, noted that respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious illnesses in adults. They said recent studies indicate that such infections annually account for 75 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> physician visits, 1.25 million hospitalizations, $ 15 billion in direct medical costs and about 150 million lost work days. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the Army is reviewing the study's results to see how much the building-related illnesses cost and whether any changes are needed in the design and construction of its buildings.

 A landlord is seeking to evict the mother of the young man who pleaded guilty in a Central Park sex killing from her luxury apartment for non-payment of rent, according to court papers. The papers, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, show that the landlord, 11 <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 99th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, claimed <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> had not paid rent from August through February and owed $ 16,733.40, which includes $ 100 in legal fees. Mrs. Chambers' son, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 21, pleaded guilty on March 25 to first-degree manslaughter in the strangulation death of 18-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. His agreement to plead came while the jury was deliberating over a verdict. The court papers showed Mrs. Chambers, 55, pays $ 2,376.20 a month for her fifth-floor apartment on the upper East Side. There was no indication of the size of the apartment. According to the court papers, Mrs. Chambers, a night nurse who makes about $ 70,000 a year caring for an elderly wealthy patient, was served with legal papers warning her that eviction proceedings were under way.

 The emerging agreement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would send the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> home but may not stop the bloodshed in that war-torn country. Under the United Nations-brokered deal, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could continue arming the Kremlin-backed regime that seized power a decade ago and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could continue arming the Moslem guerrillas. Kremlin leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his Afghan ally <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said jointly Thursday that `` the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been removed'' and that Soviet troops can start leaving on May 15 if the agreement is signed quickly. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> later told reporters the agreement is `` now finalized and open for signature.'' He said the signing ceremony is expected to take place within a week. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` cautiously optimistic'' but `` wants to see the fine print,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff. Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' that judging from public statements, `` perhaps ... what we suggested will be agreeable to them, but we still want to see the answer.'' Privately, administration officials interpreted the Soviet-Afghan statement as acceptance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions on aid. With the apparent resolution of the aid issue, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> is expected to turn his attention to a Pakistani demand for the formation of an interim government during the Soviet withdrawal, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The composition of such a government would be settled outside the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> talks by the Afghans themselves, according to <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and a dispatch by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. With no interim government, say the Pakistanis, civil war will rage, preventing the return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of an estimated 3 million Afghan refugees driven into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and another 2 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders, and many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government analysts, believe the pro-Kremlin regime will collapse as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leaves. But <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his Soviet allies believe the regime will survive. And the warring Afghan parties remain far apart over how to govern their nation. The Soviet-Afghan communique urged formation of `` a coalition government with the participation of all forces representing Afghan society, including those who are currently opposed to one another.'' And it urged a `` multi-party system,'' rather than one-party rule patterned after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The resistance has rejected <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s calls for `` national reconciliation.'' On Thursday, it announced the formation of a government to rule over guerrilla-controlled territory and the head of the resistance alliance, <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, said the guerrillas `` will try to intensify'' the war. `` No doubt, when the Russians leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime will collapse,'' he said. `` To avoid anarchy and possible armed clashes to seize power, it's necessary that all parties agree to a temporary government'' in those parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under guerrilla control. Not all the leaders of the seven-party resistance agreed that formation of a guerrilla government was a good idea. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> said it could cut the nation in half. `` If there are two governments in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, there is the danger of partition into north and south or east and west, as with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, or East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said, advocating a transitional government in exile until the pro-Kremlin regime is overthrown. One congressional source who closely follows events in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reached a similar conclusion, based on the formation of a new province in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where the Soviets have taken steps to fortify natural gas fields. The guerrillas also are split over whether <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> should have an Islamic or secular government. <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> of the hardline <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> faction said that `` colonialist countries, the superpowers _ East or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> _ have joined hands to prevent the creation of a total Islamic government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' Soviet analysts believe the pro-Kremlin government has a good chance of surviving. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> sent a cable to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last September advising the Soviets that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s 110,000 troops in the army, police and secret police might be strong enough to resist the guerrillas. A leading Soviet expert on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON>, said in a lecture in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday that `` the regime of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> may survive.'' `` It is impossible to predict the future of Najib'' and his colleagues, <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said. `` Their life is in the hands of the almighty.'' And <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, in a commentary distributed by the semi-official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> concluded that `` the policy of reconciliation has found a broad response in the opposition, including the armed opposition.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government analysts scoff at the notion that a pro-Soviet government will survive the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrawal. The Soviets have been handing out passes to government officials for safe exit from the country, according to a New York-based organization called <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> which has ties to the resistance. Western intelligence in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has also reported that lists are being drawn up for possible evacuation. And one administration observer of Afghan events, asked why <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> found it necessary to hold a surprise meeting with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in the Soviet Central Asian city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, said `` <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> must have been demanding a bigger dacha than he had been allotted on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.''

 An attractive, inexperienced undercover police officer entrapped <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> into selling her cocaine, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s lawyer told jurors today. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, the son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, is on trial in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on allegations he illegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the officer two years ago. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at the time. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s lawyer, told jurors in his opening statement this morning that the defense does n't dispute the sale, but does challenge the police actions. `` The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a regulated drug,'' <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> said. `` This is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct.'' <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> said `` an attractive female police officer'' who had never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> into making the sale. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, the prosecutor, conceded in his opening arguments that the undercover agent was inexperienced, but he asked jurors to keep in mind that the <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is a low-budget, small-town operation. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> also urged jurors not to be swayed by <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON>'s attacks on the police. `` I'd ask you to focus on what the charge is,'' he said. `` Do n't let anybody put anybody else on trial other than the defendant.'' Opening arguments came after four days of jury selection, a task slowed by the wide publicity given the case and the celebrity status of <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. The jurors are being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press accounts of the trial. The trial could last into Tuesday, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, adding that the four days of jury selection was unusual for <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. `` Until this week, the longest I ever took to draw a jury was an hour and a half,'' he said Thursday. `` It's unusual for a case to get this kind of publicity.'' Lawyers for both sides have questioned jurors on their feelings about drugs, undercover police work and the prominence of <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. Police said they began their investigation of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, now 24, after hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to the undercover police officer in his off-campus apartment. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, have sat together behind their son during the proceedings. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, a lawyer, took an active role during the questioning of jurors. She has held in her lap the jurors' questionnaires and has repeatedly written suggestions on index cards, which she tossed in front of <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> during the questioning.

 The Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia held control of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today after a four-day battle with Iranian-backed rivals, police said. The fighting killed 62 people and wounded 150, police reported. Two West German relief workers who were being held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members in the basement of a mosque in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION> were freed when Amal militiamen overran the town. They had been abducted Thursday, but their disappearance had not been reported. They were identified as <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Strubig </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, 24, of the Asme Humanitas organization. The mainstream Amal, led by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, held all major towns and villages in the south and their supply routes, police said. Amal is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s closest ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Diehard fighters of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, were holed up in three hamlets west of the market town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> mediators negotiating terms for their surrender and safe conduct, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s triumph reflected <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s determination to crush a growing challenge by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to its role as the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> But it has been alarmed at <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s widening influence and its efforts to seize control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect. Police said that one of the hamlets where <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> was still holding out was <LOCATION> Jibsheet </LOCATION>, its main stronghold in the south. <LOCATION> Jibsheet </LOCATION> is 15 miles southwest of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Amal fighters surrounded it, along with neighboring <LOCATION> Sharkieh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houmin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Fouka </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s fighters were expected to occupy the villages once <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> evacuated them. Friction between the secular leftist <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has sharpened since the kidnapping of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was kidnapped near the ancient port of Tyre Feb. 17 while serving with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An underground <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremist group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed responsibility. Amal accused <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> of being behind the abduction and rounded up several <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members it said were involved in the kidnapping. But a major dragnet failed to locate <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> or his captors. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the umbrella for several <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding many of the other 21 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine of the hostages are American.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he has `` sent a message no one can miss'' to Jewish voters troubled by his past actions while a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic official said he sees `` a clear sense of some movement'' by the state's party hierarchy toward <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> canvassed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in search of votes in the April 19 primary, which will decide the breakdown of 255 delegates. In <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not say whether he has agreed to meet with Jewish leaders to talk over his 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' or his call for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland, but he said, `` We continue to build relationships, we continue to heal relationships.'' He said that he has reached out to all ethnic groups, including Jews. `` Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of anti-Semitism, or sexism. ... We've sent a message no one can miss,'' he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and state party chairman <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirwan </PERSON> sent a signal to other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officials to line up behind one of the three Democrats in the race, and not await an endorsement from the governor. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up some support, but party executive director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said he thought the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was the beneficiary. `` After yesterday, I got a clear sense of some movement to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said today. A poll released today said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 47 percent of likely Democratic voters, while 31 percent backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was the choice of 6 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> questioned 404 Democrats Tuesday and Wednesday for the survey which had a margin of error of 5 percentage points. A similar survey conducted by the institute in mid-March had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the choice of 37 percent of Democrats and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the pick of 28 percent. A fourth Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, put his campaign in cold storage on Thursday _ and drew sharp criticism from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for technically remaining in the race to keep control of the block of 47 at-large delegates he will get as a result of his <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> primary victory. If <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> dropped out, those delegates would go to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` I would hope that in time Mr. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> ... now that he has made the decision to leave the race will leave so honorably, and hide behind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which in fact belong to me,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, considered a sure bet for the Republican presidential nomination even by his only remaining rival, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, was heading for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to wind up the fund-raising phase of his campaign. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has said he will not campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, dropped his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection on Thursday but an aide said the former television evangelist would remain an active candidate up to the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> hoped to bring `` a strong conservative message'' to the convention. The Democratic candidates crossed paths often in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, appearing at forums sponsored by the state party and The Democracy Project, a liberal-oriented group. They often found it difficult to escape the shadows of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` Who cares what ... <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says?'' responded <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> when pressed about whether he would endorse one of the contenders. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also has advised <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to tone down criticism of his rivals _ a request seconded by party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` I spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep the debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any negative campaigning,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` For the most part, we've been quite successful in that regard. The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> by Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in a positive way.'' No sooner had <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> spoken than <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> let loose with a fresh attack. He accused the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign of trying to fuel a `` stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'' movement by spreading the word that `` a vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign denied that, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has used that strategy himself. Asked if he would persist in his attacks, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, `` I think there is a legitimate role for drawing a contrast between one's approach to the issues, one's experience, one's philosophy of government and those of one's opponents. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also was unwilling to heed the admonitions of the governor and party chairman and said Jews would have to be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his views on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brushed aside the remark, saying `` Let us keep this campaign above any form of racial or religious bigotry.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came under strong criticism in 1984 for his relationship with <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> group. <PERSON> Fahrakahn </PERSON> once described <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as a `` gutter religion.'' Asked what his relationship now is with <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We do not have one. It is precisely that.''

 The mayor, two state legislators and 13 other <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> political figures indicted by a grand jury used bribes and illegal contributions to `` subvert the free election system,'' a prosecutor said. The state indictments Thursday followed federal indictments charging a police chief, a former fire chief and their families with openly running a drug ring protected by a web of bribes in the mountain coal-mining county. One state indictment charged state Sen. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> with accepting a bribe in 1982 when he was a county commissioner to assist in the sale of the sheriff's job for $ 100,000. Another indictment accused 15 others of violating state election laws and conspiracy. They are accused of conspiring with <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, the former sheriff and former county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and others to influence elections in 1984 and 1986 and county law enforcement. `` The indictment charges this group of people with attempting basically to subvert the free election system in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in numerous different acts and actions,'' Special Prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON> said. `` They conspired ... by illegal campaign contributions, by illegal campaign expenditures, by bribery, by false accounting, and by conspiring to do all these things,'' he said. <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON> emphasized that the indictments were a warning to other politicians who might use political slates to further their positions. `` I believe that if one reviews the statutes, one can see a lot of slate activity violates <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law,'' <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON> said. Among those named in a 10-count indictment were state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, county Prosecutor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapourales </PERSON>, and County Commissioners <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumora </PERSON>. The indictment alleges they `` associated together with <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and others to improperly affect and influence the free election system and the law enforcement system of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' The indictment lists five felonies and five misdemeanors, but some counts do not apply to all defendants. Also named as defendants were <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> county school board members <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, former state Delegates <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> K.O </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>, and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Meter </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, former county Magistrate <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON>, Magistrate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, former Circuit Clerk <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, former County Clerk <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, a former school board member. Also indicted was <ORGANIZATION> Goodwill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a used car dealership at <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> owned by former county commissioner and former county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> Justice. Justice was not named as a defendant. The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in county <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Some defendants said they were surprised by the indictment, which was the result of several investigations spanning more than two years. `` I've tried all my life to live a decent life, and something like this is quite a shock,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing. `` As I have said time and time again, I had nothing to do with any sale of the <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office,'' he said. `` I received no money or benefit as a result of this transaction. ... This matter will be finally resolved in a court of law. Until then I have no further comment.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was not at his office and could not be reached for comment, and <PERSON> Kapourales </PERSON> refused to comment when contacted by telephone Thursday. Fanning was at neither his home nor his office today. <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, who is awaiting sentencing after admitting to felonies involving the misuse of county funds, eferred all questions to his lawyers. `` I ca n't make any comment,'' <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON> said. `` I'm in federal custody.'' <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON> said he had not seen a copy of the indictment, but added, `` I have nothing to be ashamed of.'' The federal grand jury indicted several current and former officials in the alleged sale of the sheriff's office to current Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Eddie'' <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> in 1982. The joint federal-state probe began two years ago when investigators discovered drugs being sold so freely in <LOCATION> Kermit </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town of 700, that undercover officers were able to photograph a `` No Drugs Today'' sign posted outside a trailer. So far, the investigation has netted more than 50 convictions or guilty pleas, with no acquittals. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> was indicted in January on 13 felony counts, including charges that he helped protect a drug ring operated by then-Kermit Fire Chief <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> `` Wig'' <PERSON> Preece </PERSON> and <PERSON> Preece </PERSON>'s family. Among those serving sentences of up to 16 years for operating the ring are <PERSON> Preece </PERSON>; his wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; their son-in-law, former Police Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON>; and their four sons and two of their daughters. A third daughter was placed on probation. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and former Commissioner <PERSON> Rastie </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> have pleaded guilty and will be sentenced April 18, the same day <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> is scheduled to enter a plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors. <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> is awaiting trial.

 Attorneys for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> filed court papers today to have the retired autoworker's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship restored, more than a week before a panel of Israeli judges is to announce its verdict in <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s yearlong war crimes trial. The papers also claim that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suppressed information from witnesses that would have helped <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> substantiate his claim of mistaken identify. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was stripped of his citizenship in 1981, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled that he lied on his immigration papers to cover up his past. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, was extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> more than two years ago to stand trial. A three-judge panel heard evidence about whether he was the death camp guard called <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrible </PERSON>, who ran the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> gas chambers in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. An estimated 850,000 Jews were murdered at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> during the period. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who lived in a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb, claims he is the victim of mistaken identity. The Israeli judges are expected to render a verdict April 18. In the documents, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s attorneys ask that the order stripping him of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship be overturned. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a Ukrainian, became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1952. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has said he was drafted into the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, captured by the Germans and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the war. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law, said his family has anonymously received documents belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, which prosecuted <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s denaturalization trial. `` We've acquired documents through unknown sources that really lay out, plain and clear, what <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions were from the beginning. That they did not believe Mr. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was in fact <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible and they went ahead and prosecuted him and suppressed the evidence that would help him prove his case,'' <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said today outside the courthouse. The <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION> materials were received in 1986 and 1987, according to the court documents. The family claims there were many more witnesses than represented by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that those witnesses likely to know <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible's identify could not make an identification of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> headed for home Friday without a breakthrough on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks, but he vowed to find the time to try again `` and struggle against the odds.'' En route, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made a surprise stop in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to make some headway on a new power-sharing arrangement in battered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter flew Lebanese President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayal </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Gemayal </PERSON> was willing to consider Syrian demands to dilute the powers of his office, which traditionally is reserved for a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> worked out the terms with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The Syrian leader did not offer to withdraw his army from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is hoping that could occur if the country, torn by civil war for 12 years, is stabilized. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> cautioned reporters in an airborne news conference not to assume the surge of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> diplomacy `` means some big new development in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or on the hostages.'' Nine Americans are being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by groups that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorism experts believe are controlled by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In acknowledging only `` inches'' of progress over six days in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not assign blame to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the key parties who did not accept his proposals. And he said he was not discouraged. `` Whether you are discouraged or not has to do with your expectations of what might happen,'' he said. `` If you have the expectation everything all of a sudden is going to fall into place you'd be discouraged, but I am not that naive to think the difficult problems fall away.'' In fact, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` I think we've probably gotten a little further than I expected we might. So we'll keep at it. And I will find time, as time goes along, to come back and work at it myself.'' After several days of praising King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for taking a `` constructive' approach to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for negotiations and implying <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had not, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said: `` The Israelis are as interested in peace and stability as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians, perhaps even more so.'' He said both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had urged him to keep at it, although <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> still has `` reservations'' about a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had hoped such a meeting could be called in mid-April, but he acknowledged that obviously was now impossible. He said he had not altered the `` time line'' of his proposal, however. It calls for a conference attended by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to launch negotiations shortly afterward on Palestinian self-rule. The talks would be held between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed delegation of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The self-rule would give Palestinians on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> control over their daily lives, but not over security or foreign affairs for three years. Meantime, wider negotiations on an overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute would begin seven months after the opening of the first stage of the talks. `` There's a big need, and a very explosive kind of area,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of his determination to hold negotiations before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office next January. `` So it's worth swimming upstream under the circumstances.'' Earlier, at a news conference in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, his last shuttle stop, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> dismissed a reporter's suggestion his mission was doomed to failure. `` Who's afraid to struggle against odds?,'' he said. `` You have to be willing to do it. What am I saving myself for anyway? `` I've a few more months to go here and I want to try to leave something constructive for the region and for my successors, so I am going to put my back into it. Why not?''

 The acquittal of 13 white supremacists on sedition charges means that `` religious freedom is still alive in this country,'' says one of the defendants in the seven-week federal trial. An all-white jury Thursday acquitted the men of charges including conspiring to kill a federal judge and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and plotting to overthrow the federal government and establish an all-white nation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Afterward, one juror said jury members did n't believe the government's witnesses. Two spokesmen for national human rights organizations said the acquittals marked a setback for those fighting bigotry and racism. Defendant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, a white supremacist leader from <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, praised the verdicts. But when asked how the trial had affected the supremacist movement, he said, `` Who knows? What movement? What's left of it after this?'' `` This proves that the common law is still alive,'' said defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` This means we still enjoy the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association and freedom of religion.'' The government presented 113 witnesses during the trial, which began Feb. 16. Prosecutors sought to prove that supremacists robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million to finance their activities, including about $ 1 million still missing. The jury deliberated four days. The defense, which called 79 witnesses, contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and is serving 20 years for racketeering. To discredit <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, the defense disclosed he had two wives, thought he received messages from God and had himself crowned King <PERSON> James </PERSON> of the Ozarks. One juror, who asked not to be identified summed up the case by saying, `` We just did n't believe the government's witnesses.'' Asked if the jury put much stock in <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s testimony, the juror asked, `` Would you?'' The juror said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> and other witnesses who backed him `` stood to gain with reduced sentences by testifying for the government.'' Defendants said the government was trying to suppress their call for white separatism and other aspects of their political and religious views. `` Religious freedom is still alive in this country,'' said Miles. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> denied that the charges were politically motivated. `` We were n't after them because of what they believed or what they said,'' he said. `` We were after them because of what they did.'' <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning'': `` I do n't think that there's anything that we would have done any differently, either with the charges that we did or the way that we presented the case. We thought we had a good, prosecutable, winnable case and it just did n't turn out that way.'' Defendant <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, celebrated his acquittal by standing in the shadow of a Confederate memorial opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he calls the Zionist Occupation Government. `` I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today,'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said. `` I think everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, called the verdicts `` a real setback in the war against organized hate.'' `` Although many of the defendants are already serving prison terms growing out of their extremist activities, the others, including the most important leaders, will now be free to once again promote their anti-democratic and bigoted aims,'' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The outcome means that we must and will remain vigilant.'' The acquittal of the white supremacists was cited by Urban League National President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> as another example of the resurgence of racism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Every time something like this happens, it sets back the whole movement for fairness, equality and justice,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said Thursday night in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` You can be a racist and get away with it, and that is a very disturbing message.'' Besides Miles, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, the other defendants were: _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scutari </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, already serving 60 years for racketeering _ <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Metalline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, serving 100 years for racketeering and 150 years for violating the civil rights of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio personality <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> by killing him _ <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnhill </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, serving 40 years for racketeering _ <PERSON> Ardie </PERSON> <PERSON> McBrearty </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Gentry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, serving 40 years for racketeering _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, serving 40 years for racketeering and 150 years for <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s death _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, 57, of <PERSON> Muse </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, sentenced to die for the murder of a pawn shop operator in 1983 and life in prison without parole for the 1984 slaying of an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> state trooper _ <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>, _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>, father of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> Miles, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scutari </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barnhill </PERSON>, <PERSON> McBrearty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> were acquitted of charges of seditious conspiracy; <PERSON> Scutari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnhill </PERSON> were acquitted of transporting stolen money, and <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> and the Wades were acquitted of conspiracy to commit murder.

 The courtship between an American teacher and her Soviet fiance, who has been in this country two weeks, has spanned most of her adult life, but she's still hesitant about marriage. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, 56, met <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, 45, 21 years ago when she was a tour guide for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They planned to marry in 1979, until Soviet authorities stood in the way, and <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> has considered himself married ever since. But Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> hesitates when asked if the two will marry before <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>'s visa expires. `` We're very pleased with the way things are going,'' Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. `` I just want us to get re-acquainted a little bit, at least have two months to think about it.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has exceeded my expectations,'' <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, said last week while sitting on the steps of Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>'s home, where she has lived with her mother since she was 10. `` I want to say sincerely that I am in ecstasy,'' he said. <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> arrived for his visit March 26, and Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> met him at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` I recognized him right away, but he was wearing this horrible hat, this soft men's type hat,'' she said. `` The first thing I did was take the hat off.'' <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> said he never married after meeting Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> because he always felt committed to her. `` He always insisted that everyone call me his wife,'' she said. `` For him, coming here is more like a technicality, like filling out a form. He already feels he's married.'' <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> is planning to take English lessons and hopes to resume work as a research chemist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But if they do not marry within three months, he must return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I have confidence, but it depends on <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>,'' he said. `` As they say in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, every week has seven Fridays.'' He meant, said Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, `` that I'm a lot more up and down about this than he is.'' But ups and downs have been a hallmark of their relationship. After they met in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, they kept in touch by mail. During a 10-week visit in the summer of 1970, when Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> was studying at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> proposed marriage but she refused. On another 10-week <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit in 1979, they decided to get married that October. Their wedding was canceled when Soviet officials said they had received an anonymous letter claiming <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> was already married. That claim was false, Ms. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said, but other bureaucratic obstacles prevented the marriage. <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> lost his job as a chemist in 1982 after announcing he wanted to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and has since supported himself with menial jobs. `` There were many difficult days and much was lost,'' said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>. `` Time itself was lost.''

<HEAD>Stamp Sales Swamp Some Post Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shortages of 3-cent stamps are being reported at some post offices, but depleted inventories are being rapidly refilled, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. `` The stamps are out there, but some offices have a lot more than others,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. More than 1 billion 3-cent stamps were sent to local post offices in preparation for the rate change, from 22 cents to 25 cents, last Sunday, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. And another 600 million of the 3-cent stamps are in warehouses, being used to replenish stocks where needed, she said. `` We had asked local offices to predict how many they would need, and some had a lot more demand than expected. We've been filling orders all week,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. Sales of coils of 100 of the stamps have been especially heavy, she said, rather than people buying just a few stamps to tide them over. On the other hand, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said plenty of the undenominated `` E'' stamps remain available. Some 6 billion E-stamps, which represent the new 25-cent rate, have been shipped to post offices. Apparently, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said, people are choosing to buy 3-cent stamps in order to use up the 22-cent stamps they had on hand, before buying the new higher rate stamps. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said that the stamp shortages are scattered across the country, rather than being confined to any particular area. Most offices also have 1-cent and 2-cent stanps available, she added, and stamps can also be purchased by mail and telephone.

 Three people who spent more than $ 5,000 in 10 minutes at <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> were arrested in a $ 500,000 heist of an armored car, police said. The two men and a woman, all in their 30s, were arrested Thursday shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> manager noticed them buying gold jewelry, clothing and shoes with cash. The manager notified police because the three were dressed in jeans, old shirts and tennis shoes, police said. Authorities recovered all but about $ 10,000 of the estimated $ 500,000 taken Wednesday from an armored car by two men wearing ski masks and armed with a shotgun and a pistol. Police arrested the three suspects on a downtown street and found the money in bags next to the Neiman-Marcus merchandise in the trunk of their car. No charges have yet been filed, police said Friday.

 No punitive action was planned and no charges were filed against a hospital where a man died after he was injected with the wrong drug while undergoing kidney dialysis, officials said. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carillo </PERSON>, 68, died Wednesday at Our Lady Of <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. He and two other elderly patients went into cardiac arrest after a technician accidentally injected them Wednesday with the wrong drug, authorities said. Investigations by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Asbell </PERSON> show that a technician accidently gave the patients an injection of the painkiller lidocaine instead of mannitol, which regulates blood pressure. The other two patients, a man and a woman, were revived and were in stable condition, hospital officials said. `` There's no criminality. It's a mistake. It's considered accidental,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Asbell </PERSON>'s office, said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said no punitive action by the department was planned. She said an initial report by a team of nurses from the health department said three certified kidney technicians working under a supervising nurse were involved. She said a bottle of lidocaine was incorrectly placed on a shelf where mannitol is stored. The technicians removed the lidocaine from the shelf without looking at the label and injected the patients, Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Lidocaine is used in kidney dialysis as an anesthestic to numb the area where a large needle is inserted, while mannitol is used to stimulate kidney functions, Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. She said the kidney center staff has removed all lidocaine from the dialysis area and will use a topical anesthetic in its place. Kidney dialysis machines purify a patient's blood if the kidneys do n't function. The center has given 300,000 treatments since opening in 1969, officials said.

 White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> today hinted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is preparing to announce new economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to force the ouster of military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Administration sources, requesting anonymity, said the most likely prospect was that the administration would invoke an emergency law to forbid <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies, subsidiaries and individuals from paying taxes, fees or other payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to get American firms to withhold the payments voluntarily.

 A settlement to end the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and clear the way for the removal of Soviet troops is completed and ready to be signed, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator said today. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops will begin leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the Afghan guerrilla alliance said it wo n't be bound by the agreement and vowed to continue the war until <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government is overthrown. `` We have discussed, we have negotiated. That's over,'' mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` I want to inform you that the documents are now finalized and open for signature.'' He said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were prepared to sign a five-point peace package worked out during almost six years of on-and-off negotiations between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> represented Moslem guerrillas who have been fighting the Afghan government since April 30, 1978, after a communist coup set up a government friendly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet troops entered the war on Dec. 1979 and an estimated 115,000 are in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> now. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confirmed the May 15 troop withdrawal during a speech to Communist Party officials in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, where he met Thursday with Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Both leaders said Thursday that obstacles to an agreement had been cleared and that the accord was ready to be signed. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency filed an urgent report out of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> this afternoon saying the agreement was completed. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said the agreement was expected to be signed by Thursday. `` It is not a perfect agreement because it was worked out by human beings,'' but it `` reflects the reality of the situation,'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said. `` The test of this agreement will come in its implementation, and therefore I hope that people will give it a chance,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> added that he was convinced all parties `` will exercise restraint in taking any actions'' that might violate the agreement. But a statement from guerrilla alliance headquarters in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said the agreement was made `` to be violated.'' `` As far as the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> are concerned, they will not be bound by the outcome of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements and they will continue the war as long as the Russians and their puppets are present in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. When asked what language the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were prepared to sign to guarantee the settlement, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said, `` All that is pending.'' He would not elaborate. The mutual U.S.-Soviet guarantor role had been in doubt because of a dispute over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for `` symmetry'' in the amount of superpower aid to the warring sides. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the guerrillas' main weapons supplier. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had argued that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to insurgents could n't be compared to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> aid to the government. An official source at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that a separate deal, outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> pact, calls for a mutual aid cutoff as soon as the Soviet troops start withdrawing. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> refused to discuss the issue and said it was not part of the peace package, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have said the agreement appears to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for ending aid to the warring parties. The accord was reached after nearly six weeks of negotiations in the latest round of indirect talks between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Setting the time of signature `` involves a number of logistical questions,'' said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who mediated the talks by shuttling back and forth between the delegations. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> refused to meet in person with the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> delegation because it does not recognize <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had objected to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s insistence that arrangements for a transitional government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> be worked out before the signing of an accord <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said parties to the talks agreed that the settlement's goals `` can best be ensured by a broad-based Afghan government The hope was therefore expressed that all elements of the Afghan nation, living inside and outside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, would respond to this historic opportunity.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said a fifth document has been added to the original four-point accord _ a memorandum of understanding on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring arrangements for the accord. The other documents include Afghan-Pakistani agreements on principles of mutual relations and the safe and voluntary return of Afghan refugees, a declaration of international guarantees, and a fourth part tying the others together. The texts have not been made public. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>'s announcement came less than an hour after <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s envoy to the talks, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, said his country was ready to sign the accord. Minutes later, Pakistani chief envoy <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> reiterated that his country was ready to sign. `` I would not be signing if I was not satisfied,'' he told reporters.

 About half the students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> school </ORGANIZATION> want a faculty committee to reconsider its recommendation the school dismiss its 1988 `` teacher of the year'' co-winner. Students boycotted classes Thursday and have signed petitions in support of Associate Professor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thel </PERSON> `` is an outstanding professor,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> campus. A committee of tenured law school faculty voted last month to recommend administrators terminate <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>'s contract, although he will be allowed to finish the school year. The matter is pending before <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, who will make his recommendation before forwarding the matter to Chancellor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. The faculty committee's review of <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>'s teaching, research and productivity `` resulted in a vote not to continue his employment at the unversity,'' Turner confirmed Wednesday. <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>, 34, a three-year university employee, declined to comment. At least 167 students _ about half the law school student body _ had signed a petition demanding <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>'s contract be renewed, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a third-year student from <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The petition claims tenured faculty members are playing politics in their recommendation to terminate <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>'s contract. `` We do not understand the logic behind ostracizing a professor who has expressed a genuine concern for the academic development and general welfare of the students,'' the petition said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, a first-year law student, said the school's `` old guard'' does n't like <PERSON> Thel </PERSON>. `` He's a Northerner, and he's liberal,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> denied that was a factor. <PERSON> Thel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> were named `` teacher of the year'' in student balloting last month. <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, the law school dean, was out of town and unavailable for comment on the student demands. Associate Dean <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said administrators canceled classes for three hours Thursday because of a campus awards ceremony, `` so it's difficult to tell how many did n't come to class.'' Instructors at the school set their own policies on absenteeism, he said. Officials said <PERSON> Thel </PERSON> is ineligible for tenure _ a guarantee of job protection _ because he has n't been at the university the required six years.

<TEXT>
 Police today dispersed about 800 demonstrators who tried to rally in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy calling for the dismantling of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases in the country. Police said at least 20 police officers suffered minor injuries. Three demonstrators were arrested, they said. The demonstrators were negotiating with police officials late in the afternoon when a group of protesters dashed across the street towards the embassy. The police gave chase, using riot clubs, while another group succeeded in going to the side of the embassy. Other demonstrators hurled stones at the riot police. A fire truck opened their water cannons against the demonstrators who scurried into sidestreets fronting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. Earlier, the demonstrators were chanting `` dismantle the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases'' and `` down with imperialists'' as they arrived near the embassy from a downtown plaza. Police Col. <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> said at least 20 policemen suffered stoning and clubbing injuries. A rally official who spoke on condition of anonymity said they had no figures on how many demonstrators were injured but said two leaders were apprehended by police. Police could not immediately confirm the arrest of the two officials but said they arrested three other demonstrators. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> began talks last Tuesday on the status of American military bases here. The outcome of the talks, expected to last three months, will determine whether the government allows the bases to remain after their lease expires in 1991. The six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases are the largest American installations left in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, head of the American negotiating panel, says the installations are essential to protect the region from Soviet expansion.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> threatened retaliation Friday after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> blocked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for creation of an international panel to resolve a dispute over beef and citrus imports. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also urged Japanese industrialists to use their political clout to block the protectionist measures for which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s farmers are lobbying. `` I regret the Japanese today blocked our request for the formation of an independent ... panel to review <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s beef and citrus quotas and other restrictive practices,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement. Hours earlier, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, `` If the intransigent attitude that prevails in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the moment on beef and citrus continues, we are clearly heading toward retaliation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and somebody will pay the price.'' `` It may or may not be the Japanese agricultural producers, but someone will have to pay the price of retaliation,'' he said. The Japanese move came Friday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> at a session of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> to form a panel of independent experts to determine whether the Japanese citrus and beef import quotas were consistent with international trading laws. But the Japanese ambassador, <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatano </PERSON>, rejected the panel, saying the dispute should be resolved in bilateral discussions. Since <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> council decisions are made by consensus, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request was effectively rejected. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to consult with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but if a solution is not found in the coming weeks it will renew its request for an independent panel at the next <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> meeting on May 4. `` Continued resistance to the establishment of a panel at that time would undoubtedly lead to further escalation of this dispute,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> he had information that Japanese industry is already reacting to the possibility that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might curb its imports of Japanse goods as a retaliatory measure. `` I just saw a cable today that indicates that a number of Japanese industrialists are now beginning to speak up on the issue because they are fearful that if it is not resolved satisfactorily'' they will suffer retaliation, he said. `` They should be pounding the desk of Japanese government officials, saying ` do n't let the agriculture folks have the controlling voice in this issue,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added. The U.S.-Japanese agreement on citrus and beef imports expired last month and no new accord has been reached. Under the 1984 agreement, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to admit 141,000 tons of American beef in 1984, rising to 177,000 tons this year. The agreement called for a 1,100-ton a year increase over the 1984 quota on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organge imports of 82,000 tons. The quotas are being demanded by the politically powerful Japanese beef and citrus farmers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials argue that the Japanese would benefit greatly by imports, saying that beefsteak in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now costs four times the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price and citrus costs at least double the American market price.

<HEAD>Candidate Protection Bill: $15,000 Per Man Per Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The afternoon before he quit the Democratic presidential campaign, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> drove himself to a local shopping mall and bought two sport shirts for a week-long vacation trip to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Not an unusual event for a man about to spend some leisure time with his family. But for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the shopping excursion was the first time in three months he appeared in public without a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> escort watching his every move and those by people around him. The constant protection has a price in personal freedom, as well as in dollars. The Secret Service has protected five 1988 presidential candidates, not including Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for the past few months at a cost of $ 15,000 a day for each man. Until the number of candidates began to dwindle _ the federal agency only protects two now _ the cost to the taxpayers was $ 75,000 a day or $ 525,000 a week. As expensive as that might sound, it pales at what was spent to guard <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> during his 11-day visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year _ $ 4.9 million or some $ 445,455 per day. Secret Service Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary for enforcement, in recent testimony and documentation submitted to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee, called the Pope's visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` the single most demanding protective event in our history.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> received a supplemental appropriation of $ 5.6 million to cover the costs of the pontiff's visit, in addition to its regular budget of $ 367 million for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who has since been nominated to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 3 man, and <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has protected four Democrats and one Republican presidential candidates over the past four or five months. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gets coverage by virtue of his office, and Democrats <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also receive the protection. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declined protection. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor's wife, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believes that `` it would be just one additional layer from the people.'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a similar belief. Candidate dropouts Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> also received <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> escorts. So did Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has all but abandoned his race. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> never guarded <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> because a five-member advisory committee did not recommend them to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary who makes the final decision. Candidate protection is determined by a panel consisting of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader and minority leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and minority leader, who meet to make recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Among the things taken into consideration: the number of delegates a candidate receives and whether any death threats have been made against the candidate. If the secretary accepts the panel's recommendations, the candidate is notified. To decline protection, a candidate must inform the secretary in writing. The Secret Service received an appropriation of $ 29.9 million for fiscal 1988 to provide the protection during the campaign. The agency is seeking another $ 7.1 million to cover the campaign period from Oct. 1 until the Nov. 8 election, and then for coverage of the president-elect, the vice president-elect and their families and spouses through the inauguration.

 <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former political director, was sentenced to 90 days in prison today and fined $ 30,000 for illegally lobbying administration officials after he left the White House. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> could remain free pending an appeal of his three felony convictions of contacting former colleagues on behalf of private clients within a year of leaving President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> could have been sentenced to two years on each of the three counts. The $ 30,000 was the maximum cumulative fine the judge could have assessed. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> imposed a complicated sentence of two to eight months' incarceration for each of the counts but then suspended all but 30 days of each of the sentences so that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> will have to serve only 90 days if his appeal is denied The judge rejected the defense plea that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> be sentenced only to a short period of unsupervised probation. Outside the courthouse, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> told reporters, `` I thought things were going to go better than they went.'' Asked about the prospects of an appeal, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said, `` In my heart of hearts, I do n't believe I'm going to serve time because I do n't believe a prison sentence is justified even if I were guilty. And I repeat that I am not guilty.'' Before he was sentenced, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> stood before the judge and said he wanted to reiterate `` my belief that despite my conviction I have done nothing ethically, morally or legally wrong.'' `` I am an honorable man,'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> told the judge. `` Like other honorable people, I have gone through life making mistakes, doing stupid things. I doubt that there is a person in this room who has n't. But I am not a criminal and I think the record of my life will bear out that statement.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, issued a statement from their vacation home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that said in full: <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> is s dear friend of many years and our prayers are with him.'' <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> to pay the $ 30,000 fine within 30 days. Like the prison term, however, the imposition of the fine was stayed pending appeal. The judge also ordered that after his imprisonment <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> be placed on two years' probation. The judge agreed to a defense request that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> be sent to a minimum-security federal prison. Before he was sentenced, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> told the judge, `` I know there are those in this ourtroom who believe that I should be sent to prison unless I come here today and plead guilt, express remorse and ask forgiveness.'' But, he added, `` I can not do that if I am to be true to myself and to those hundreds of fine people all over the country who have supported me in recent months because they believe I am an honorable man.'' Still, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said, `` I do have remorse. I am distressed beyond measure. I trusted in others rather than relying on myself. I am distressed if I have embarrassed my family and my friends and my president.'' After the hearing, independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said, `` We're very satisfied with what Judge <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> has done today.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> had declined in court to make an additional statement on the sentence he had sought. The prosecutor, who said in a court filing that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had shown `` a total lack of contrition and remorse,'' had urged imprisonment to signal the seriousness of <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s offense. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, asked by reporters how he felt about the sentence, called the question `` stupid'' and added: `` How do you think I feel? What do you want me to do, say I feel great?'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> `` set out to get me. He set out because I would not knuckle under, because I would not cop a plea, and because I would not say that I was remorseful, and I think he succeeded.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> `` makes mountains out of molehills. He has exaggerated. He has misstated. And I think he has lied.'' `` I do n't think he is an honorable man,'' he said. When the sentenced was pronounced, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> shook hands with several people in the courtroom, then kissed his wife and other family members. One man said he was sorry; <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> shrugged. For the defense, lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> told reporters, `` We're disappointed, but I think the judge did a good job of trying to balance the symbol Mr. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> has become -LRB- for the ethics law -RRB- against the man Mr. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> is. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 63, was sentenced for illegally lobbying former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration colleagues on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the scandal-wracked defense contractor, and a marine engineers union. He had been found guilty Feb. 11 of violating the Ethics in Government Act, which restricts lobbying by former government officials. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> likened his offense to `` running a stop sign.'' A number of current and former government officials, including Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, had signed letters vouching for <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s integrity and character. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> urged the judge to `` show compassion and understanding'' and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> to balance `` the requirements of justice with the quality of mercy.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted of urging then-presidential counselor <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to intercede to help <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> get a $ 32 million no-bid Army contract to build small engines. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> got the contract. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was also convicted of illegally contacting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beneficial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which was seeking to expand civilian manning of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> support ships The third conviction dealt with a contact <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had with two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aides for <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which made the A-10 anti-tank plane. In his sentencing memo, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also urged a large fine, arguing that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had unjustly enriched himself through violations of the law. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, received stock in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a result of the successful effort to lobby <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, now attorney general. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> sold their stock for more than $ 600,000, according to congressional testimony. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s net worth is more than $ 2.8 million.

 The following is a partial text of exchanges between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> control tower and the hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner as the plane tried to land at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday, as obtained and translated by The Associated Press: The pilot asked the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> tower for permission to land, saying the hijackers are threatening to land `` by force.'' Tower: If you try to land by force, the plane will be fired on. Pilot: A gun is pointed at my head. I request landing permission to load to refuel. Tower: We have been for 14 years under gunfire. -LRB- Hijackers then ask tower to pass along message to Interior Minister <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rassi </PERSON> asking only for permission to refuel. <PERSON> Rassi </PERSON> broadcast a refusal. -RRB- Hijacker: I shall punish control tower officials if they do n't allow us to land The passengers are all in panic now and many of them are vomiting. Among the passengers is a member of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family with a heart condition. Tower: With all due respect to all families, permit me to say that all the Lebanese suffer heart ailments. Do not try to talk to me sentimentally. Passenger: I plead with you to allow us to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The hijackers insist on landing in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and emphatically refuse to go to any other airport. There is no fuel left to take us to another airport. Pilot: Please inform the ministers of justice, interior and public works that we are compelled to land at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. There is no other option for us. Tower: There is no chance of landing. You will have to shoulder the responsibility of your action. Pilot: If you fail to clear the runways within a few minutes, we will land in the sea. Tower: Do whatever you want. Crash on the tarmac or in the sea ... We shall not let you land here.

<HEAD>Pope Denounces Abuses, Seeks Settlement with Rebel Bishop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Friday condemned doctrinal and liturgical abuses in the Roman Catholic church and said he still hopes for a settlement with rebel French Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. `` The need to distinguish from what authentically builds up the church from what destroys her is becoming in the present period a particular demand of our service to the whole community of believers,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s powerful guardian of church orthodoxy. <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>'s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has worked toward reaching a settlement with <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, who heads the traditionalist <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> was suspended from his priestly functions by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> in 1976, meaning he is not allowed by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to say Mass or give the sacraments. He continues to celebrate the forbidden 16th century Latin Tridentine Mass and claims to have millions of followers worldwide. In October, the pope charged Cardinal <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> with the task of trying to resolve the <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> has ordained illegally more than 200 priests in the past 15 years. In February, he was quoted in an interview with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> as saying he planned to consecrate three bishops this June, a move that would lead to his automatic excommunication. `` Your Eminence knows very well how many efforts have been made by the Apostolic See since the beginning of the existence of the ` fraternity,' in order to ensure ecclesial unity in relation to its activity,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> in a letter released by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` I would assure your eminence once more of my desire that these efforts should continue. We do not cease to hope that ... they will bear fruit,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote. Also referring to <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote: `` All the bishops of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> ... are bound to collaborate with the Apostolic See for the welfare of the whole mystical body, which is also the body of the churches.'' In his letter, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the church was striving to ensure that the doctrine of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council was being followed. `` However, side by side with this effort there have appeared tendencies which create a certain difficulty in putting the council into practice,'' the letter said. `` One of these tendencies is characterized by a desire for changes which are not always in harmony with the teaching and spirit of Vatican Council II.'' `` These changes claim to express progress,'' the letter continued, `` and so this tendency is given the name ` progressivism.' In this case, progress consists in an aspiration towards the future which breaks with the past, without taking into account the function of tradition, which is fundamental to the church's mission.'' The pope also denounced what he described as the opposite tendency of `` conservatism'' or `` integrism.'' This tendency `` stops at the past itself, without taking into account the correct aspiration towards the future,'' he wrote.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, had an adjusted gross income of $ 345,359 in 1987 with a federal tax liability of $ 86,638, according to tax returns released today. That income was $ 8,990 above what the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> reported for 1986, while their tax bill rose $ 5,822. Taxes as a percentage of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' gross income rose from 25.1 percent to 27.5 percent. The couple had $ 67,392 withheld for federal income taxes last year and paid an additional $ 30,000 in quarterly payments, for a total of $ 97,392. That means they paid $ 10,754 above what they owed the government. Rather than getting a refund, the couple elected to apply that amount to their 1988 taxes. Included in the gross income was the president's $ 200,000 salary, $ 54,179 in interest income, $ 46,208 in capital gains and $ 29,711 in income from his pension for serving as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from 1967-75. The income also included $ 1,526 in appearance fees paid to the president and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. This included $ 1,312 paid to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his appearance on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Tonight'' show and $ 214 paid to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in residual talent fees for re-runs of two programs in which she had appeared in 1986. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the $ 1,312 fee paid to the president was `` required to be paid ... under union agreements'' in the television industry, and said that the $ 1,312 was donated along with other money to his alma matter, <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in Illionois. Charitable deductions totaled $ 25,407. After deductions, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' total taxable income was $ 263,767. The tax returns were released a day after White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife had made sure `` all of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed'' before leasing a $ 2.5 million <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home purchased by friends. But questions about the arrangements the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> made with the consortium that purchased the home persist. These involve the secrecy surrounding the identities of the 18 to 20 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friends who purchased the home, and the question of why the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> decided to lease, rather than buy, the house. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> consider the home-leasing arrangement a private matter, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> has said. And on Thursday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the pair `` may not like'' all the press scrutiny surrounding the deal. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, confirmed that lawyers representing the consortium approached the agency in July 1986, and `` we did make an analysis'' of the proposition at the time. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the office produced an informal opinion on the ethical ramifications of the deal. The White House, which has made only a limited disclosure of the terms of the three-year lease the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> signed effective March 1, said that before buying the three-bedroom, six-bath house, the prospective owners, most of them friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, sought an opinion on the propriety of the deal. It said the opinion concluded that the Reagans would comply with standards of conduct regulations and conflict of interest statutes if they paid a fair-market rental or purchase price. It said the lease terms were negotiated by representatives of the owners and the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, based on fair-market value rental estimates from two independent appraisers. The home, on a 1 \ - acre property in the poshest section of <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, is near the <PERSON> Kirkeby </PERSON> estate where the television series `` Beverly Hillbillies'' It has a heated swimming pool and a three-car garage. Real estate sources estimate the monthly rent at $ 12,000 to $ 15,000, based on fair-market value. The Reagans are known to feel strongly about their privacy, and the first lady during the early years of the administration made it clear she wanted information about the president's health handled carefully by the White House press office. And the first couple has chafed over past reporting of difficulties involving <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> children and relatives. On Thursday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was asked if the president and his wife were upset by the spate of media reports on the home-leasing deal. `` Oh, I do n't think so,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, standing outside a seaside resort hotel cottage not far from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mountaintop ranch. `` I think after eight years, they've come to understand that that occurs, and while they understand it, they may not like it, but they are not angry about it. `` The White House, the president and the first lady went to great lengths to make sure that this was an arms-length transaction, that there was a full appraisal of the rental property and that all of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife have handled the leasing of the home `` in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism.'' The property was purchased in August 1986 by the consortium, which has incorporated itself as <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Realtor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm of <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, said that with rising prices since the purchase, the land alone is worth $ 3 million `` They got a great buy,'' he said. `` They bought it for land value. As far as I am concerned, they got the house for free.'' Realtor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaroe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the house, built in 1954, still has the original kitchen and needs a great deal of renovation.

<HEAD>New Code on Plastic Bottles Intended to Promote Recycling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Plastic bottles soon will carry a single-digit number inside a triangle on the bottom to help guide recyclers and promote the practice, a plastics industry group said Friday. The numbers, a half-inch high or larger, will designate the kind of plastic used, according to Council on Plastics and Packaging in the Environment. `` There is a perception that plastics are not recyclable,'' but it is untrue, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabourin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wellman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a major buyer of used polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, soft drink bottles. <PERSON> Sabourin </PERSON> said his company buys 100 million pounds of used bottles a year, about two-thirds of the 20 percent of all PET bottles that are recycled. It could use twice as many bottles and in a few years could need three times the current amount, he said. `` The industry feels it's better to self-regulate than to be regulated,'' said <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, recycling manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The council called a news conference to present its view that trash disposal should make room for recycling, incineration, landfilling and composting. Plastics, it said, are 7.2 percent of the national garbage stream of 133 million tons a year. The council knows of at least 256 bills in 35 state legislatures, `` probably more than on any other issue around,'' dealing with garbage, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. There have been several bills that would simply outlaw certain plastic containers, although none has passed above the local level, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Several other bills would require some form of recycling code. The voluntary identification system devised by the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> calls for number codes on all plastic bottles of 16 ounces or larger, and other containers of 8 ounces or more. Almost all recycling markets are designed to handle one kind of plastic at a time, though various efforts are under way to develop techniques to separate mixed plastics. The triangle surrounding the number will have an arrowhead incorporated in each side, the arrows pointing clockwise. Underneath will be letter abbreviations or acronyms representing the plastic. Codes should start appearing within six months and appear on all containers within three years, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Currently, soft drink bottles are almost made of PET, and milk bottles are high-density polyethylene, and recyclers can recognize these easily. These materials and other plastics are used in other containers that could be recycled if they could be quickly identified also, the council said. Here are number and abbreviation codes: 1. Polyethylene terephthalate, PET. 2. High-density polyethylene, HDPE. 3. Vinyl, V. 4. Low-density polyethylene, LDPE. 5. Polypropylene, PP. 6. Polystyrene, PS 7. Other plastics, including bottles of more than one kind, OTHER.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Pullout to Start May 15, But Not as `Present' to

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Friday that Soviet troops will begin coming home from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15, but he added the move should n't be seen as `` a present to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'' for their upcoming summit meeting. Soviets interviewed on the streets of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> welcomed the news, saying `` Many people have suffered.'' Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> carried a brief report on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech to party activists in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> following the announcement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that negotiators had agreed on a plan for settling the 10-year-old war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, on Thursday and declared in a joint communique that all obstacles to a war settlement and withdrawal of the Soviet forces had been removed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency did not immediately report the 57-year-old Soviet leader's speech, and the nightly TV news program `` Vremya'' said only that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had met with Uzbek party leaders before returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> led its evening newscasts with a few details of the address. It said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confirmed Soviet soldiers would begin pulling out of the conflict they entered more than eight years ago, and that documents outlining terms of the peace accord were ready for signing on Thursday. `` At the same time, the Soviet leader said the withdrawal of the troops should not be regarded as a sort of present to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the eve of his visit to the U.S.S.R.,'' the official broadcast said. `` We, he said, are carrying out the plans outlined in our statement in February.'' It was in a Feb. 8 speech by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the May 15 date was first proposed, but at the time it was made contingent on a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement being signed by March 15. That speech also offered to `` front-load'' the withdrawal, or have at least half of the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers leave within the first three months, and to complete the withdrawal within 10 months. Soviet officials have observed privately, however, that they would like to have all of their troops home by the end of the year. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Dec. 27, 1979. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said Friday that back-channel U.S.-Soviet diplomacy was involved in clearing the final obstacle to a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement: the question of continued aid to the warring sides. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks had been pressing for `` symmetry'' in foreign aid to the combatants, arguing that if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the rebels was prohibited, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> should likewise cut off military aid to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. `` The Soviets know very well and in great detail our position and have indicated that it is acceptable to them,'' said the diplomat, who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration prefers a moratorium on arms shipments to continued deliveries to both sides, but that no agreement had been worked out yet. The senior envoy also suggested that the Soviets' steadfast efforts to stick to the May 15 start date for withdrawal was likely connected with a general attempt to clear away superpower disagreements in advance of the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I think they are cognizant of the value in having their troops begin to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before the president comes,'' he said. `` It would probably create a better atmosphere at the summit if they have started.'' News of the agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, which is to be signed Thursday, traveled slowly to Soviet citizens, who get most of their news on international affairs from `` Vremya.'' Evening newspapers went to press before <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that a package of documents outlining the settlement was ready for signing. Soviets told about the breakthrough in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said they were delighted with the news. `` It's time to get out already,'' said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Butyugin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at a news stand near <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` Many people have suffered.'' <PERSON> Butyugin </PERSON>, 32, said the decision to enter the war was correct because their <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> allies asked for help, but that `` now it has dragged on and on.'' A 27-year-old woman who did not want to give her name said she welcomed the news that a settlement had been reached and said the war had hurt the Soviet people. `` All's well that ends well,'' declared <PERSON> Larisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON>, 41. `` The main thing is that there will be peace.'' She said the war had taken a heavy toll on Soviets, although she said she did n't know how many of her countrymen had been killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Casualty figures have never been reported by the Soviets. Six soldiers approached by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter outside the <ORGANIZATION> Dzerzhinsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> along the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> refused to discuss the war or its influence on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I do n't have a personal opinion, we only have a government opinion,'' one said.

<TEXT>
 The far right exulted Friday in a victory in a seditious conspiracy trial, but others said the very freedoms of the country they attacked allowed the white supremacists to exist. `` The jury's verdict speaks for a growing patriotic sentiment to ` just say no' to black power in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Forsyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` The jury's verdict announces that pro-majority Americans are not a cult, but are a rising voice of the silent majority,'' he added. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> briefly attended the federal court trial, which began Feb. 16 and ended Thursday with an all-white jury's acquittal on all charges of the 13 white defendants. Nine of them were accused of plotting to overthrow the government by violence and set up an all-white nation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. `` What I find interesting is that the system they hate so much has set them free,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON>, a lawyer from <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. He is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Kootenai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations, which was formed to resist movements advocating racial violence after the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was based at nearby <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renewal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the verdict makes it `` clear that it's not possible to rely on legal solutions.'' What is needed, she said, is `` more community involvement to counteract'' the white-power movement with `` all non-violent appropriate responses.'' `` It is ironic'' that the the freedoms of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizenship _ the right to speak out, the right to trial by jury _ protected those who spoke against the government, Ms. <PERSON> Sears </PERSON> said. The voices of the far right `` are going to view that acquittal as a green light,'' she said. `` They are going to step up their activity. So it is very, very important that those of us who love democracy become more vigilant.'' Prosecutors sought to prove the supremacists robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million to finance their activities, including about $ 1 million still missing. The jury deliberated four days. The defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and is serving 20 years for racketeering. To discredit <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, the defense disclosed he had two wives, thought he received messages from God and had himself crowned King <PERSON> James </PERSON> of the Ozarks. In Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, Urban League national President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said the verdict was another example of the resurgence of racism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are seeing a climate that is permissive of racist behavior,'' he said. `` People have become comfortable in engaging in this climate. Every time something like this happens, it sets back the whole movement for fairness, equality and justice. You can be a racist and get away with it, and that is a very disturbing message.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning'' program Friday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who prosecuted the case, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON>, said: `` We thought we had a good prosecutable case. ... But the jury chose otherwise and that's the great thing about this country is our jury system.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, a television producer who was the government's first witness, said on the same program that earlier convictions of some of the defendants may have caused the jury to think they were being prosecuted a second time for the same things. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, who testified about what he saw and heard when he went undercover into the Aryan Nations compound at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was optimistic about the acquittal. `` I think that the radical right will be forever changed by this decision here,'' he said. `` They have a dilemma. They were protesting about the federal government and now they've been treated fairly by the federal government. That's going to have a telling effect.'' He said some older leaders `` told me that they were going to get out of the business, in essence. They're going to go home and write books, pass their churches on to someone else.''

<TEXT>
 Foreign relief workers on Friday began complying with a government order to return from the drought-stricken north where civil war has stymied efforts to feed millions of people threatened with starvation. About 24 expatriates returned to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the capital, aboard a U.N.-chartered Hercules C-130 transport plane. Two of the aircraft had been used to carry food into the most severely drought-affected regions of Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. The returning workers included employees of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Belguim </LOCATION> group <ORGANIZATION> Medicin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontieres </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Doctor Without Borders -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faim </ORGANIZATION>. They had been operating out of the Eritrean town of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> and are among about 60 expatriates sent to the north, where crop failure threatens more than 3 million people with starvation. It was unclear when the rest of the foreign relief personnel in other northern towns would be pulled out. The government <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday ordered all relief agencies to bring its foreign workers from the north `` to avoid personnel security risks'' from rebels operating in the area. The commission said it would assume responsibility for the massive relief operation, which already had been crippled by the civil wars in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre. The order came a week after President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> admitted for the first time that his government was in a `` grim struggle'' with northern rebels. He called for a national mobilization of troops. Since then, government vehicles used in the relief operation and planes flying domestic and international routes for state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have been requisitioned to move troops and equipment, relief officials said. Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the central government. It is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. In neighboring <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>, rebels have been fighting for 14 years. None of the foreign relief workers in the north wanted to leave or expressed any fears for their safety, said agency officials. The officials said the doubted the commission could handle the food distribution operation alone. `` We're facing a very catastrophic situation right now,'' said one senior relief official. `` It will take months to resolve the war. In the meantime, you've got three million souls up there and the government is not going to let any food out at all.'' Government officials plan to feed only those people in the few government-held areas, primarily urban centers which are home to only a fraction of the drought-affected population. `` Three million people have somehow got to get food,'' the relief official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have said the order removing foreign relief workers from the north was an attempt to choke off their rebellions.

 An award-winning play about a student's suicide has been deleted from a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacinto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> literary magazine because the school chancellor believes the play's language is too offensive. `` It's an excellent play.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> on Friday launched a stern attack on the Western media, accusing them of creating unrest in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Addressing a two-day meeting of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> also announced plans to speed up some of the modest economic reforms the conservative <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership has adopted to try to stimulate the economy. He also said there would be a limit of two five-year terms for the party leader and three successive terms for regional party officials. In addition, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said, party officials should not accumulate too many functions and should be elected by secret ballot. He stressed, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must retain its powerful role as the leading force of Czechoslovak society, saying that the party must strengthen its `` influence on what is happening in society.'' `` In no case can party work be narrowed to mere educational activity,'' he stressed. In his 57-page speech, published by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> accused unidentified `` hostile propaganda'' abroad of preparing `` a slanderous campaign'' connected to the 20th anniversary of the failed <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms of former Communist party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. He also accused unidentified Western media of fomenting unrest, particularly among religious believers, who have recently staged two unusual demonstrations calling for religious freedom. Almost 500,000 Roman Catholics have signed an unprecedented petition for more freedom to practice religion. `` Recently, we have been witnessing how anti-Communist forces try, with the assistance of some Western media, directly to organize the creation of opposition groups, incite them toward actions which are to create unrest and tension in our society and even hide this behind religious motivation,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said. `` We have to reject these efforts resolutely,'' he added. `` In our state, all believers can enjoy religious freedoms ... and take part in religious life and rites.'' `` Do not let us overrate or underrate the endeavors of the enemies,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> went on. `` We have considered this in the -LRB- Politburo -RRB- ... we shall not permit anybody to parasite on the process of restructuring and democratization. `` The laws of the state are valid for all and those who violate them must count on legal consequences.'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>' words signaled that opposition groups will not be included in any immediate dialogue with the Communist authorities, as has been hinted at in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Turning to the economy, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> noted that performance had improved in the first quarter of this year, but that almost one in five state-run enterprises is performing below target. He said a new law on enterprises which decentralizes their management will come into force July 1 this year, and not next January as originally announced, and also spoke vaguely of plans to trim the central bureaucracy. Later this month, according to informed sources, parliament will approve the merger of four technical ministries into a `` super ministry'' of engineering, headed by 51-year-old technocrat <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerle </PERSON>. Social welfare and health ministries, transport and communications ministries and the ministries running agriculture, water and forestry are also likely to be merged. It is estimated that 30,000 to 50,000 bureaucrats will lose their jobs.

<HEAD>Personal Debt Grows Strongly for Third Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 5.3 billion more in installment debt than they paid off in February for the third consecutive strong monthly gain, the government said Friday in a report that provided further evidence that consumers have not stopped spending. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said consumer debt increased at an annual rate of 10.3 percent in February, down slightly from the 12.2 percent rate of growth in January. In that month, installment debt had risen by $ 6.24 billion following a December increase of $ 4.3 billion. Analysts credited the big increases to strong auto sales. Domestic automakers reported earlier this week that they had their best January-March sales period since 1985, gains that were helped by incentive programs. This strong consumer demand has eased fears that the October collapse of the stock market would frighten Americans into slowing spending so much that the country could be faced with a recession this year. `` We are seeing a stronger first quarter than we had initially expected. One of the favorable developments is the final round of tax cuts consumers are getting because of the 1986 tax law,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the Wasington-based <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Consumer spending is crucial to the country's economic health because it accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity. Consumer spending grew 1.9 percent last year, after adjusting for inflation, and Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said she is looking for similar moderate growth this year. She said this forecast could be jeopardized if interest rates start rising significantly, boosting the costs of credit purchases. Rates have been rising in recent weeks as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has apparently tightened up slightly on credit to keep the economy from overheating. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said fixed-rate mortgages rose in the current week to 10.19 percent from 10.05 percent last week. In February, the credit report said, auto loans rose by $ 3.31 billion, a 14.7 percent annual rate of increase, after rising by $ 2.7 billion in January. The category that includes credit card debt rose by $ 1.49 billion in Febuary, down from a January increase of $ 2.76 billion. The debt category that includes loans from banks and credit unions not secured by real estate edged up $ 564 million in February after a small gain of $ 807 million in January. The various changes left total consumer debt at $ 619.2 billion at the end of February, an increase of 8.9 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Residents of Leningrad Helped Dry Books After Disastrous Fire</HEAD>

 Residents of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> helped dry books in their homes after a fire at the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> library founded by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, according to an expert helping the Soviets cope with the disaster. `` This was the biggest disaster in modern history to a library,'' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said Friday. `` This material was valuable to not only Soviet scholars, but scholars from all over the world.'' The Feb. 14 fire damaged or destroyed an estimated 4 million books at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1714, said Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, one of three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts who helped the Soviets begin restoration. Many books suffered water damage, and the library called on residents for help, handing out wet books with instructions for drying them, Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. Not one was stolen, she said. `` Many of these books were rare books and they all came back beautifully dried,'' she said. `` They ended up drying something like half a million books.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s state cultural fund chairman, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, has accused <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials of trying to conceal the extent of the damage and of using bulldozers to clear away piles of damaged books. Library officials in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> have said those charges are false, and Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said she `` saw no indication that the library had tried to cover up the fire. The library was very candid about what the losses were.'' Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, assistant director of preservation at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hillman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, said flames destroyed an estimated 400,000 books and damaged 3.6 million more, including 17th-century scientific collections, Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. Soviet librarians are still assessing the damage and exact losses wo n't be known for at least another month, Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said, but some of the burned books, particularly those concerning science history, were probably the only ones in existence. The library, in a 1920s building, contained more than 12 million books, manuscripts and periodicals. `` The only way this library is going to recover from this is with help from the international library community to replace the materials that have been lost,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> has led restoration efforts in several library disasters, including a fire at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> library two years ago. She and the other two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts have been invited to return to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> within the next year.

 A pheasant egg hunt for Chinese children is being planned by biologists from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Department of Natural Resources. They hope to retrieve eggs from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Szechwan province to bolster and perhaps supplant the state's ringneck pheasant population, which has declined drastically the past two decades. Biologists think the Szechwan pheasants are better adapted to survival on the brushy, rural terrain of southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` The children are looking for them anyway, because they eat them, or feed them to their dogs or sometimes just smash the eggs and nests, because they do n't like pheasants because they eat their crops,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> biologist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Squibb </PERSON>, head of the program to rebuild the pheasant flock. The children will be paid about 25 cents for each egg. DNR officials hope to return with 2,000 eggs, half of which are expected to hatch successfully and lead to a population of 2 million to 3 million birds in the 1990s.

 At the urging of a kidnap victim, a judge has sentenced the two men who pleaded guilty to the abduction to prisons where they can get help with their crack cocaine addictions. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 53, was kidnapped March 3 by two men who bound her with electrical cord and gagged her with a sock, then forced her into the trunk of her car while they drove around for three hours. After she was let out, she grabbed a gun that had been concealed in the car and held one of them until police arrived. `` The thing that amazed me about her was that she still had compassion for these people. You'd think that somebody tied up in the trunk for three hours would have wanted them sentenced to as long as she could,'' Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Refik </PERSON> <PERSON> Eler </PERSON> said. `` She seemed to feel it was more important that they be helped. A lot of victims that I see will just say ` Fry'em.''' He noted that her compassion is even more remarkable since her daughter was murdered in 1980, leaving her to raise her grandchildren. `` I feel compassion for them because they're young men,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Thursday after sentencing. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 24, not related, admitted Thursday that they kidnapped Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked Circuit Judge <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olliff </PERSON> to give them a second chance and urged that they be sent to a prison where they could rehabilitate themselves. Each could have received up to nine years, but <PERSON> Olliff </PERSON> imposed less-than-maximum terms. In addition to the kidnapping, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to a charge of grand theft for stealing Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s car. He was given six years in prison. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> pleaded guilty to an additional charge of armed robbery and was sentenced to 5 -LCB- years. <PERSON> Olliff </PERSON> said he will ask that <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> be placed in a youthful offender facility where he can learn a trade. Officials will be asked to place <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> student and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran, in a prison where he can get drug counseling. The two men visited Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on March 3 and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a friend of two of Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s children, asked her to write a letter of reference for him to get a job. When she turned to go into her house, she was grabbed by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who demanded all her money. At the same time, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> tied her hands. `` At this time, I was sure they were going to kill me,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who told the men where she had $ 20 hidden. They got the money, then took her out to her car and put her in the trunk. The men finally stopped, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> opened the trunk and said he would free her if she would write him a check. `` I said ` You have to give me the keys so I can get a pen out of the glove compartment,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. While she opened the glove compartment, she grabbed a .22 - caliber pistol she kept hidden under the front She held <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> at gunpoint until police arrived. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> fled but turned himself in the next day.

 A hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet carrying 55 people landed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, today after the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> airports refused to let it land and the captain said he was running out of fuel. `` I'll never forget this, thank you,'' the captain shouted into the radio after <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> air traffic controllers told him he was cleared to land. The blue and white <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 touched down at at 9:10 p.m. -LRB- 2:10 p.m. EDT -RRB- after <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to let it land and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport officials said it would be fired on if it landed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> authorities said a `` state of emergency'' was declared as the plane made its final approach to land at the facility after nighfall. The jetliner left <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at 2:28 p.m. -LRB- 6:58 a.m. EDT -RRB- after the Arab hijackers threatened to blow it up. It was hijacked Tuesday on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and forced to land at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>. The aircraft parked at the end of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> airport's single runway. A few minutes later the captain, in a calm voice, requested fuel, but did not say if the hijackers wanted to take off again. The hijackers were demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. Earlier, the pilot pleaded with the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> International Airport control tower to be allowed to land. `` A gun is pointed to my head. I request landing permission to land to refuel,'' the captain was overheard shouting through the jet's radio at 5:25 p.m. -LRB- 11:25 a.m. EDT -RRB-. `` We have been for 14 years under gunfire,'' an airport official replied, referring to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. `` If you try to land by force, the plane will be fired on.'' According to sources monitoring radio traffic, a man speaking in Arabic with an east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> accent came to the radio and asked that controllers put him in touch with <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> officials. But Interior Minister <PERSON> Abdulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rassi </PERSON>, in a statement broadcast by the official media, again refused to allow the plane to land. A hijacker then said: `` I shall punish control tower officials if they do n't allow us to land. The passengers are all in panic now and many of them are vomiting. Among the passengers is a member of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> ruling family who has a heart condition.'' A control tower official in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radioed back saying: `` With all due respect to all families, permit me to say that all the Lebanese suffer heart ailments -LRB- from the war -RRB-. Do not try to talk to me sentimentally.'' Three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> royal family were aboard the plane. One of them, a woman identified as <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, told the control tower in a choking voice: `` I beg you. Allow us to land. We have no fuel left.'' Later, sources said, the pilot radioed back and said, `` If you fail to clear the runways within a few minutes, we will land in the sea.'' The sources monitoring the conversation spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Do whatever you want,'' the controller said. `` Crash on the tarmac or in the sea. ... We shall not let you land here.'' The pilot had reported at 10:30 a.m. EDT that he had enough fuel for three hours. A <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> control tower official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that fire engines and passenger buses of <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s flag carrier, were parked on the airport's two runways to block the plane from landing Syrian troops, who control the airport, blocked all roads to the airport on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern edge. The gunmen _ believed to number about six _ released 57 passengers since Tuesday. All the remaining hostages aboard the plane were believed to be Arabs, including more than 30 Kuwaitis. One passenger was believed to hold both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Egyptian passports. Before Iranian workers removed obstacles to takeoff in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, the hijackers brought a man to the top of the stairway and fired three warning shots, then tossed a grenade out the door, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not say whether it exploded. The captain was quoted as saying a passenger was forced into the cockpit and beaten, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the captain gave that report after being queried about a wail of pain heard over control-tower radio. It was not clear whether the man shown in the stairway was the beaten passenger. After the hijackers released some of the hostages on Thursday, the jet was refueled, but only after the hijackers fired five shots at security men, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The 57 released hostages arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane that picked them up in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>. They appeared tired and dazed. They were taken to another area in the airport and did not speak to reporters there. One, <PERSON> Irishman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kelly </PERSON>, was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` The hijackers are very determined young men who are quite willing to die. I am concerned for the safety of the hostages left on board.''

<HEAD>Official Presidential Election Campaign Opens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The presidential campaign opened Friday, a race with few new faces and fewer new ideas that has evolved into a battle of personalities among the three major candidates. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a Socialist seeking a second seven-year term, continues to hold a wide lead in public opinion polls over conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 55, and former center-right Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, 63. The other six candidates in the race stand little chance of accomplishing more than using the election to expound their ideas, ranging from radical left to extreme right. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, will have no trouble winning the most votes in the April 24 first round, though he is likely to fall considerably short of an absolute majority. The real contest is between <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> for the No. 2 spot and the right to face the incumbent in the May 8 runoff. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> is the favorite in the battle for second place and has been increasing his lead over <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>. The polls show <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> defeating either <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> or Barre by as much as 55 percent. The conservatives are pinning their hopes on the large number of people who are undecided. In contrast to the 1981 presidential election, which featured a clear ideological choice between Socialism and free-market liberalism, the traditional cleavage has disappeared. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who founded the modern <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and led it for a decade, did not once mention the words Socialist or Socialism in his 25-page `` letter to the French'' this week, setting out his platform. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the standard-bearer of the Gaullist tradition, also has `` rounded off his corners.'' In a TV interview Thursday night, he said he wanted to enlarge the composition of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> beyond his own political camp and admitted agreement with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on some subjects, such as defense and foreign policy. The platforms of the three major candidates all focus on the same themes, differences being largely a matter of nuance. All three say they are for the development of a unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> must be prepared for 1992 when the last trade barriers come down in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. All stress reforms in education as a key to reducing <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 10.4 percent unemployment. And all recognize the need to spur technological research to improve economic competitivity. Both Socialists and conservatives admit there is no quick solution to unemployment, the overriding issue of 1981. The programs of all three focus more on general orientations and less on specific measures. The differences between <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> are even narrower, a difficult subject for the uninitiated. The presidential campaign effectively began in March 1986, when <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservatives ousted the Socialists from control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. That created what the French call `` cohabitation'' between a leftist president and a rightist government _ a unique situation in the history of the Fifth Republic. The official campaign that began Friday means the final list of nine candidates has been published. It also means that from now until the elections, radio and television time is strictly rationed, with each candidate receiving the same amount of time. Also, law prohibits the publication of any opinion polls in the week immediately preceding the election. Lacking clear-cut ideological differences and innovative ideas, the race has evolved into a beauty contest among the major candidates. On one side is <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, once the most unpopular president of the Fifth Republic with poll ratings now soaring to be seen as the sage, lovable `` uncle.'' On the other is <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the hard-driving bulldozer, workaholic, avid campaigner and flesh-presser in his second tour as premier. He contrasts with <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, the heavyset economics professor of intellectual brilliance but distant, somewhat cold personality. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of having a vague program and said he was asking the French to elect him now and see what he does later. `` One does n't win a battle by idly dreaming at the fireside, one does n't engage the future in warming his slippers,'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> says <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s program has three characteristics, `` obvious immobilism, masked Socialism and constant imprecision,'' and his goal `` is to remain in place, and from that moment everything will be fine in the best of Frances.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> says the right lacks heart and accuses it of unconcern for social justice. Rounding out the field of candidates are <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, leader of the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, 58, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate; <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, 58, head of a splinter <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> group; <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>, 39, ecologist; <ORGANIZATION> Arlette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laguiller </ORGANIZATION>, 48, a Trotskyist; and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussel </PERSON>, 67, another extreme left Trotskyist.

<BYLINE>Khomeini Leads Iranians To Polls Despite Missiles

 Iranians chanting `` War, war until victory!'' defied threats of Iraqi missile attacks Friday and voted for a new parliament after being urged to go to the polls by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run television showed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 87 and reported in poor health, voting in the morning chill at an open-air polling station near his home in the northern <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jamaran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was one of the first to cast ballots when the country's 30,000 polling stations opened for 12 hours Later, the government extended polling hours until 10 p.m. because many people were still voting. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, surrounded by Iranians chanting `` We're not tired of the war!'' voted early. The official media said the turnout among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 20-25 million voters was `` massive,'' but it gave no figures. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had called on his followers to turn out in force to defy the Iraqis. The results may take up to 10 days to be announced. Polling stations in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> were crowded, although as many as half the capital's 6 million people have fled the city to escape Iraqi missile attacks. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that one missile crashed into the capital before dawn and that the cities of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> were also hit. No details were given. Iranian leaders had feared the Iraqis would launch a massive bombardment to disupt the election. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that the turnout was `` wonderful, a sign of the people's fierce resistance.'' It was the third parliamentary election since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. The last was in 1984. The new parliament will be vital in determining the future of the revolution and in choosing a new leader when <PERSON> Khomeni </PERSON> dies. At stake were all 270 seats in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. There were more than 1,400 candidates, including women for the first time. Parliament members are elected to four-year terms. One voter said he came to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Amol </PERSON>, about 120 miles to the north, to show that he was `` not scared.'' `` I decided to vote here after they said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would be the target for many missiles,'' he said. He declined to give his name. Anyone over 16 years old was entitled to vote, provided they produced photo identity cards. Analysts predicted the new parliament would be dominated by radicals who would give the government a broader mandate for reforms that have been blocked by the conservatives. The radicals favor a planned, socialist-style economy with price controls and stringent enforcement of tax laws. Conservative-leaning clerics made up only 20 percent of the candidates.

<TEXT>
 The battle to save Big <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> has failed, but the memory of the 150-year-old pecan tree is going to be preserved in furniture and mementos and by a party. The tree, said to be the fifth - or sixth-largest of its kind in the world, is n't likely to survive a move from the path of a highway expansion, so it's going to be cut down <PERSON> Dewayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who has been working to save the tree, says he will begin negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to have the tree removed in late fall. Big <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> stands three miles south of <LOCATION> Corinth </LOCATION> on a farm <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> inherited from his grandfather. The decision to cut down the tree was made this week after forestry and horticulture experts from <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> completed tests that indicate the tree could not survive being uprooted and moved. So the tree will be used to make a piece of furniture for the governor's mansion and to make small wooden crosses that will be given to the 100 children who have become members of the Big <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The horticulture experts also will try to make grafts of the pecan tree, which <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> plans to plant near where Big <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> now stands. And <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is planning a party _ with hot dogs and lemonade _ in late November. `` We have much to celebrate,'' he said. `` It was a unified effort that brought the Big Ike Bunch together.''

 A 98-year-old woman who moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1927 on Friday became the first person to gain citizenship under the amnesty program allowing aliens to legalize their status. `` It seems like it is not true,'' <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said in Spanish after the ceremony. `` It is so big, it seems like a fairy tale.'' The widow and great-grandmother sat in a chair, raised her hand and took the oath of allegiance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in Spanish from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>. `` What you're doing today, <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarita </PERSON>, very much is a heroic event,'' said <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>. A case of overnight nerves sapped some of her strength, Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> said. But after it was over she felt strong enough to wave a flag provided by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. A cake inscribed `` Congratulations Citizen Clara'' and a special luncheon held by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> awaited her at the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> about a quarter-mile from the Mexican border. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said the reception was his agency's way of thanking Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> for being a public relations agent for the one-year amnesty program ending May 4. Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> appeared on parade floats and television commercials and helped motivate other aliens to apply under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 offering legal residency and ultimately citizenship to those able to prove they have lived here illegally since before 1982. `` She is the first person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who applied for amnesty to become a citizen,'' <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said. She is not the oldest person to apply for amnesty under the program; that distinction apparently goes to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero-Gaitan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a 101-year-old Mexican who was smuggled into the country in the back seat of his son's car 14 years ago. Joining Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> in becoming citizens Friday were a 74-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, and two granddaughters, 47-year-old <PERSON> Rakel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> and 44-year-old <PERSON> Genoveva </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. `` It has given me new dimensions of my love for this country,'' said <PERSON> Rakel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON>, who said her husband was killed by <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>'s men during the Mexican revolution, lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> legally from 1927 until 1962 But in a bureaucratic mix-up, immigration officials took away her `` green'' card _ which is now blue and shows legal residency status _ because they thought she had been living in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in violation of the card's terms. She has lived as an undocumented alien with relatives in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> since 1979. Officials gave her a new green card in February and were able to waive the normal five-year wait for citizenship because she satisfied that requirement 56 years ago, in 1932, said <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>. Otherwise she would have had to wait until 1994, when she would have been 104. Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> said she had always planned to become a citizen during her first 35 years in this country, but kept putting it off. She never learned to speak English, but the requirement does not apply to applicants over age 50 with more than 20 years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residency. She learned how to say at least one English word on Friday. `` Citifen? Citipen?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> said haltingly under her daughter's coaching. `` I am <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen,'' she finally said, with a broad smile.

 Negotiations on an <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> settlement were completed Friday, allowing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to pull out of a war with Moslem guerrillas to which it had committed a force of 115,000 soldiers. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said he expects the five-point peace plan to be signed by next Thursday. The signing will end nearly six years of indirect talks in which he was the go-between for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and its eastern neighbor, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON>, said the date of the signing ceremony will be announced Monday. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confirmed that Soviet troops will begin leaving on May 15, but added the withdrawal is not `` a present to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' The two begin their fourth summit May 29 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> has a mandate from all sides to promote dialogue within Communist-ruled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, there is no guarantee the 10-year-old war will stop. The U.S.-supported insurgent alliance was not included in the negotiations and issued a statement Friday saying its fighters `` will not be bound by the outcome of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements and they will continue the war as long as the Russians and their puppets are present in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' In a statement approved by all sides, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> stressed that `` any questions relating to the government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' are an internal matter. `` We have discussed, we have negotiated. That's over,'' he told reporters. `` The documents are now finalized and open for signature.'' He called the settlement a `` historic opportunity'' for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Agreement became possible after what diplomatic sources said was a secret understanding that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will phase out aid to the guerrillas while Moscuw cuts off military support to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said all parties are ready to sign, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as guarantors, after a final round of negotiations that lasted more than five weeks. The agreement covers Afghan and Pakistani assurances of non-interference in each other's affairs, safe and voluntary return of Afghan refugees, and superpower guarantees. A fourth part ties the others together and <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said a memorandum of understanding was added on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in supervising the agreement. Texts are to be published later. Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> represented the guerrillas in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and delivers supplies to them, including highly effective <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, most in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply points for the insurgents. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had said it would not sign the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord until the Soviets agreed to `` symmetry'' _ a simultaneous end to military aid on both sides. Diplomatic sources called the informal agreement on ending outside aid a face-saving solution for both sides. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said it was not part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> settlement. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the deal was made through behind-the-scenes diplomacy. In a clear allusion to the question of outside military aid, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said he was convinced all parties `` will exercise restraint in taking any actions'' that might violate the letter and spirit of the accord. `` The agreement is designed to bring peace to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the conditions for such a peace would not be obtained if actions are taken which would fuel hostilities,'' he said. Intense Soviet diplomatic activity this week preceded the agreement. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the Afghan leader, in the Soviet Central Asian city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> earlier this week and they issued a joint statement Thursday saying all issues had been resolved. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, deputy Soviet foreign minister, flew to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to meet the Afghan foreign minister, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, apparently because <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had been holding out over a border dispute with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The dispute, dating to 1893, had provoked arguments over the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> settlement's reference to boundaries. A source close to the talks said it was resolved on Friday. Early last month, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed on completion of the Soviet troop pullout in nine months, with half leaving in the first three months. The timetable had been a major sticking point.

<HEAD>$121 Grocery Trip Turns Into $80 Million Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No matter how many steaks <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> placed in her shopping cart, her husband knew the grocery trip did not cost what their bank said she spent _ $ 80 million. `` I was a little surprised. I knew it was a mistake,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 41, said Friday. An shopping trip March 23 to a supermarket cost $ 121.78, which Mrs. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> paid with an automated teller card from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. But a bank error added $ 80 million more. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, an electronics technician, said he realized something was wrong several days later when he could n't withdraw money from their account. He tried unsuccessfully several times, then called up his balance on the machine. `` This huge number with a minus sign comes spilling out,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. Since the automated teller only goes up to $ 1 million, the machine showed his account overdrawn for that amount. Despite this shock, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> wanted to buy some flags and went to a flag store. `` I said, ` I think I'm a million dollars short, so can I write a check?''' Since the owner knew him, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> was allowed to write a check. He then called his bank, which, he said, insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrongs </ORGANIZATION> had mistakenly written a check for $ 80 million. He noted, however, that $ 80,000,121.78 had been deducted from their account and finally deduced that the mistake stemmed from the check for groceries. Still, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> was left without money over Easter weekend. `` I had to rob my kid's piggy banks,'' he said. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> corrected the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrongs </ORGANIZATION>' balance Tuesday. A bank spokeswoman said it was a clerical error.

<TEXT>
 A tough stand on drugs was the main theme Friday as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his presidential hopes buoyed by a new poll, campaigned in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Asked at a senior citizens forum what he would do to protect the elderly from criminals, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor quickly turned his answer to drugs. `` I'd wage a real war, not a phony war, on drugs,'' he said, drawing loud applause. `` We've got to get tough on the flow of drugs into this country.'' An earlier speech at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, billed as a major foreign policy address, also emphasized the need to deal with drug trafficking. `` In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the gravest threat to our security comes not from the Sandinistas, but from drugs,'' he said. In the three-way Democratic race for the 255 delegates at stake in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a growing lead in a new poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>. The survey of 404 likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters found 47 percent naming <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as their presidential choice, while 31 percent picked <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 6 percent Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The interviews were conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and the poll had a margin of error of 5 percent, meaning the figures could be off by 5 points up or down. A <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll taken less than a month ago reported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 37 percent of likely Democratic primary voters while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 28 percent. At the senior citizens forum held at <ORGANIZATION> Adelphi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was opposed to means testing for Social Security and said that two-thirds of the people receiving the federal retirement benefits had no other income. At St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advocated using a portion of foreign aid for drug enforcement programs in producing countries. He also criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's ties to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people deserve a full explanation of what and why we were doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' he said. On the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` challenge <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to join the agreement recently signed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Western powers to stop the sale of long-range missiles to all countries in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also `` must enlist every nation we can in the effort to ban poison gas, something that is being used right now, right now, and to impose tough sanctions against any country dumb enough and savage enough to use these weapons against their fellow human beings.''

 Clutching sack lunches along with their rifles and machine guns, 290 Marines boarded giant cargo jets and flew to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Friday for jungle training exercises. The Marines joked among themselves, listened to a Dixieland jazz band and waved to Mom as they passed in front of television cameras before boarding two C-141 jets that took off before noon. `` I'm just going down to get a suntan,'' said Cpl. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelluto </PERSON>, 21, a radio operator from <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>. `` We have been told to be on our best demeanor.'' The Marines, dressed in camouflage and carrying M-16 rifles, M-60 machine guns and other weapons, are members of the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The exercise is unrelated to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military buildup prompted by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s current political turmoil, said Lt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, a Camp Pendleton spokesman. Five hundred more Marines leave next week for the training, he said. The last of 1,300 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops arrived Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, completing a buildup meant to provide greater security for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, American installations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. `` This whole thing for us is purely coincidental,'' said <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>. `` This particular training evolution has been scheduled since December.'' `` We do n't have jungles in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and they do down there at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> school so we go there to train,'' he said. The government-controlled press in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> contends the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>' arrival is a step toward a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion aimed at ousting Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the 15,000-member Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> forces, refused to step down when fired by the country's civilian president, who then went into hiding. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been trying to oust him with economic pressure. The arrival of the 800 Marines will bring to more than 12,000 the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in the Central American country. The Marines leaving Friday range in age from 18 to 45, and while few have combat experience, executive officer <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said they were prepared to fight if necessary. Said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 21: `` I'm looking forward to it. I've never been down there.'' He said his biggest worry was getting sick from the food. Nicaraugan-born <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> dropped one of his weapons as he boarded the plane. His penalty, several push-ups, was imposed immediately; he did the exercises with his feet on the boarding ramp and his hands on the ground. When asked if he was nervous, <PERSON> Stelluto </PERSON> said: `` No. It will be hard enough just to deal with the insects and frogs and the things in the jungle like that as it is.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looked ahead to the fall presidential campaign on Friday and said he did n't expect the Democrats `` to hemorrhage to death'' despite their hard-fought campaign <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on his first political trip since <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> quit the race and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> scaled back his effort, was asked by reporters if he minded not having the discipline of a primary race. `` I'm delighted it's worked out the way it has.

I would n't trade, let's put it that way,'' he said. `` I wish I thought the Democrats would have a unity problem but I do n't think they will. I'm not counting on the blood on the floor that exists on this moment to carry over and cause the Democrats to hemorrhage to death,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured an aircraft assembly plant and climbed into the cockpit of a General Dynamics F-16 fighter jet and planned to attend several fund-raisers during his two-day swing through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had no intention of making an early selection of a running mate. `` I'm not in the mode of picking or even going through the elementary selection process,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 The first phase of a huge dam designed to prevent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from flooding out the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> neared completion Friday on the line separating <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The first phase of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> `` peace dam'' is scheduled to be finished next month. The Olympic Games open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sept. 17. The rockfill dam sits in a valley close to the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. It will cut off the flow of the <LOCATION> Han </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which originates in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and runs past <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> before flowing into the Yellow Sea. Construction began in late 1986, shortly after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> began building a hydroelectric dam on an upper stream of the river. Despite <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s repeated claim that its dam was designed only to generate power, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials suspect that it also is intended to unleash a `` water offensive'' against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. If the North Korean dam collapsed, about 26 billion tons of water could submerge most of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and surrounding areas with a `` nuclear force,'' South Korean officials say. `` We have done something which was considered difficult to be done in time,'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> In-ho </PERSON> of the government's Industrial Site and <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> told reporters visiting the dam site near <LOCATION> Hwachun </LOCATION>, a border town 55 miles northeast of the capital. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is building the dam on a phased program designed to match the progress of the North Korean dam under construction about 22 over the DMZ. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> hurried the first phase of the project in fear that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would try to flood some major sports facilities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Han </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> before the Olympics. `` If <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> attempts to flood us, the damage would be far beyond our imagination,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hee-sung </PERSON>, chief designer of the state-run Industrial Site, said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> poured $ 250 million into the first phase of construction. The dam would eventually cost more than $ 600 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, he said. The dam will be at least 215 feet high, but it could be made higher to match the North Korean dam, he said. He said satellite and other military intelligence reports show that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is also accelerating work on its dam, digging diversion tunnels that made the river bed dry so that ground work for the dam could start. The South Korean engineer said he believes that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is helping <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with the construction. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> questioned the economic feasibility of the North Korean project, saying that when it is finished in four or five years, the dam could probably utilize only 10 percent of water it takes in.

<HEAD>Freedom Asked For Woman Who Refuses To Disclose Daughter's

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for plastic surgeon <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> asked a federal judge Friday to free her from jail, where she has spent seven months for refusing to allow visits between her daughter and the girl's father. Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said the incarceration, the latest event in a bitter custody battle, has become irrational and unconstitutional because `` Dr. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> will never relent.'' The plastic surgeon has been at <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Jail since last Aug. 28, when she refused a <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge's order to allow her 5-year-old daughter to visit her ex-husband, who she charged had abused the child. She has refused to disclose her daughter's whereabouts since then. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said that since Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> ordered the woman jailed to coerce her to reveal the girl's whereabouts, `` Dr. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s incarceration has become punitive.'' `` She will never comply with the order of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` It is not likely any woman, any parent, could relent when she has seen what has happened to her daughter.'' The woman has charged through a long-running battle over the girl's custody that <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, also a prominent doctor in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, abused the child. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has denied the charges. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the issue of whether the length of incarceration was unconstitutional had not been dealt with by the lower court or by the local appeals court and so a federal court may not be the proper forum for the case. The judge said she expected to rule next week on whether to release the woman.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Operation Alliance Not Stopping War On Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Turf wars, mismanagement and lack of leadership plague a government task force created to stop the flow of drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border, a congressman who investigated the operation said Friday. `` Once again, a lack of leadership is undermining the war on drugs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations justice subcommittee, which spent a year scrutinizing <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and issued a critical report this week `` No one is in charge, no one is responsible.'' Operation Alliance, set up in August 1986 to coordinate drug-fighting efforts in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> by a variety of federal agencies, is headed by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary for enforcement. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chose <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> this week to fill the No. 3 spot in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, that of associate attorney general. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had no comment Friday on the report and a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has several agencies involved in the alliance, referred questions to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. English, D-Okla., said he does n't fault <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to quell drug smuggling but blames the administration for not giving someone the authority to marshal staff and resources from the various agencies `` Operation Alliance is a good idea that is n't working because of turf battles and a lack of strong leadership from the top. The agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, have been mired in the same interagency feuding which has frustrated nearly all of our federal anti-drug abuse programs,'' English said. `` In good conscience, I ca n't say Operation Alliance has made much of a contribution,'' English said from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. English blamed part of the problem on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s `` refusal to participate'' and also on Customs for not lending its air wing in the fight on drugs along the 2,000-mile border. `` Operation Alliance is limited to ground action, but 60 percent of cocaine comes in by air,'' English said. The report said that although administration officials had promised to put an additional 300 Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexican border, where one-third of marijuana, cocaine and heroin are believed to be smuggled into the country, there has been a net loss of agents. Participating agencies failed to coordinate efforts and did not use the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, or EPIC, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics information is stored and disseminated, the report said. The subcommittee compared the number and size of seizures in the year before Operation Alliance with the first year after it went to work, and found the size of the seizures had increased dramatically. But it said it was concerned the number of seizures has `` not increased as dramatically as the administration has implied.'' According to the report, EPIC figures indicate there were 246 cocaine seizures along the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> border totaling 2,256 kilograms between July 1985 and June 1986. But during the following year, there were 120 cocaine seizures totaling 7,685 kilograms.

<HEAD>Accord Removes a Thorn, But Won't Speed Up a Treaty, Baker Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Soviet decision to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will remove one contentious issue from next month's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit agenda but probably wo n't speed negotiations on a superpower arms accord, the White House chief of staff said Friday `` I think it will have a salutary effect on attitudes, but I do not think it is likely to have a major impact on the other issues on the agenda,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters covering President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was vacationing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> awaited notification that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> had accepted an American proposal under which each side would continue aiding its allies in the Afghan war as the estimated 120,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin had rejected an earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal that both sides stop arming the warring parties during the nine months over which the Soviets agreed to withdraw their troops, plus three months thereafter, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediator, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that an agreement could be signed by the end of the week, and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could start leaving May 15. `` We have discussed, we have negotiated. That's over,'' mediator <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said. `` I want to inform you that the documents are now finalized and open for signature.'' Even though the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> accord is likely to improve the atmosphere, at the May 29-June 2 summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other administration officials say they do not expect to reach agreement before the summit on the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The treaty would cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent. Soviet officials say publicly that a START treaty could be signed at the summit, but privately acknowledge it is unlikely they can reach agreement. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> denied published reports, attributed to anonymous <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials, that the superpowers had agreed to stop aiding the warring Afghan parties. And he stressed that the administration was withholding formal endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agreement until reading the final terms. `` We have made it known that we will continue to aid the mujahadeen if the Soviets continue their aid to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government,'' he said. `` The mujahadeen are not being abandoned. They're not being put at a disadvantage. They will be supplied as long as there is a need for that and as the Soviets continue to supply the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government.'' `` After we've had a chance to examine the text of the agreement and heard formally from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we will decide if all of the conditions have been met for us to continue and to participate as a guarantor of this agreement,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Neither the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nor the Afghan guerrillas are direct parties to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks, which involve the government of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Kremlin-backed regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say agreement on aiding the Afghan parties hinges on a clause in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord guaranteeing that foreign powers will not intervene or interfere in <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> affairs. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has been channeling an estimated $ 600 million a year in covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the guerrillas, has agreed to continue that program as long as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> aids <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said administration officials who spoke on condition they not be further identified.

<TEXT>
 A man who was killed by police after pretending to hold a teen-age girl hostage for three hours had a history of erratic behavior and family problems, said a woman who had been one of his many foster mothers. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, 19, died Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> from a single gunshot wound to the stomach to end a three-hour standoff in which he held police at bay from his apartment with what turned out to be plastic water pistols. Police originally thought <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> had taken a 15-year-old girl hostage, but after the shooting she told authorities the drama was a charade and she was a willing participant. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocasio </PERSON>, who took in <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> when he was 15 and had a history of family problems, said: `` I knew he was erratic, so I wanted to help him. I knew that if I could just talk with him, that would help.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and spent most of his life on the streets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Ocasio </PERSON>. He came to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> with his mother about four years ago. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>' mother suffered from mental disorders and frequently spent long periods in state hospitals, forcing her son to live with foster families, Mrs. <PERSON> Ocasio </PERSON> said. His father remained in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. While living with the Ocasios, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> attended high school, maintained a B average and saw a counselor, she said. But his life always took a turn for the worse whenever he saw his mother. `` Something about her just set him off,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ocasio </PERSON> said. Hoping to stabilize him, Mrs. <PERSON> Ocasio </PERSON> said she arranged for <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> to live with a foster family in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He stayed there for some time before moving back to <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to live with his mother, but she was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Harrisburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> about a year later, and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> `` went downhill from there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ocasio </PERSON> said. District Attorney <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebert </PERSON> said Friday the investigation of the incident is continuing. He would not identify the girl involved nor say if she was being held for questioning. Police originally said the marksman, whom they have refused to identify, fired when <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> threatened to kill the girl. But videotape recorded by WGAL-TV in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was shot seconds after yelling, `` I'm coming out,'' and placing both hands on a window frame. No gun was in sight. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spanish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>; the mayor; and Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hose </PERSON> did not return phone calls for comment Friday afternoon. The officer who fired the fatal shot has been placed on administrative leave without pay, pending an investigation that could last four weeks, <PERSON> Rebert </PERSON> said. The district attorney said <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> had a `` long-standing history of mental health problems involving bizarre and unpredictable behavior.'' Police records indicate <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> sometimes went into public buildings impersonating health and police officials. He once went into City Hall carrying a briefcase and asked to see Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON>. Police said <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was apprehended after threatening the mayor and a pellet gun was confiscated. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentzler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>' boss at <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snacks </ORGANIZATION>, said he worried about <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, but not that he might hurt someone. `` He tells me he had no friends,'' <PERSON> Gentzler </PERSON> said. `` I knew he needed some help, so I reached out to him as a father figure.'' <PERSON> Gentzler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, who worked the overnight shift, got along well with employees. He did have `` a little verbal battle with a few workers'' early Wednesday, but <PERSON> Gentzler </PERSON> said he did n't think it was anything to worry about.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired four long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other Iranian cities Friday before Iranians began voting in parliamentary elections. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired rockets into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and other cities in retaliation. Each side said the other's missiles hit residential areas, killing civilians. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, also reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes hit a `` large maritime target,'' which usually means a tanker, off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Persian Gulf coast before dawn. There was no immediate independent confirmation. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said Iranian artillery shelled the strategic <LOCATION> Dukan </LOCATION> hyrdoelectric dam in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where Revolutionary Guards have captured a large chunk of mountainous <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> in the last three weeks. It was not known whether the dam, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oil fields, was damaged The Iranians occupy heights overlooking another important dam and power station on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Dukan </LOCATION>. Crippling or capturing the two facilities could leave the strategic region around <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> without power. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have fired nearly 300 long-range missiles into each other's population centers in the latest chapter of the so-called `` war of the cities.'' Hundreds of civilians have been killed on both sides since the battle broke out Feb. 29. The <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> news agency said that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles were fired Friday into residential neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> in the northwest. It said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes raided several Iranian cities, but gave no details. The Iraqi missiles smashed into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hours before polling stations opened, killing or wounding civilians, the agency said. It gave no figures. However, the attacks appeared to fall far short of the missile blitz Iranian leaders had been expecting during the elections for the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament. The agency said the Iranians retaliated by firing two missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, two into the northern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>, two in the border town of <LOCATION> Khanaqin </LOCATION> and one into <LOCATION> al-Amarah </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military area in the south, causing `` considerable damage and casualties.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> confirmed one of the strikes on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and said civilians were killed, without citing a number. It reported other fatalities from long-range Iranian artillery fire on Iraqi border cities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its warplanes bombed military targets in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the jets hit residential neighborhoods in the northern city of <LOCATION> Amadiya </LOCATION> and in border towns, killing civilians.

<HEAD>Independent Counsel Answers Motions of Iran-Contra Defendants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> denied Friday that the he illegally relied on the congressional testimony of defendants in the Iran-Contra case who received limited immunity from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A brief filed by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office said the `` overwhelming majority'' of his case against former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> is based on evidence collected before the three defendants gave congressional testimony last year. `` Defendants involvement in the activities underlying the indictment had been fully identified prior to any of their immunized testimony,'' said the prosecution brief filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. `` The government, in short, had no need for any imunized testimony to focus or aid its investigation,'' said the pleading filed by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a former federal judge who was hired to represent the independent counsel on the immunity issue. The prosecution opposed the motion by the three defendants to dismiss the indictment on the the ground that the criminal charges violated their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. The three, along with retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, are accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the lead witness at last year's congressional hearings, gave his testimony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> without limited immunity. Under the so-called `` use immunity'' granted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is prohibited from using the congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> as evidence against them. But <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> argued that the immunity restriction does not apply to statements any of the defendants made voluntarily to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra committees. Such statements are distinguished from compelled testimony given in response to questions, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. But the prosecution offered to forgo introduction of such statements by the three defendants as evidence if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> agrees not to hold an extensive pre-trial hearing on the immunity issue. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> called the defense request for a `` massive, multi-month'' hearing an attempt `` to use pre-trial proceedings to delay their trial by jury and obtain unparalleled discovery in a criminal case.'' The prosecution proposed to submit for <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s review `` sufficient evidence _ documents and witness interviews all collected or requested before the immunized testimony _ to demonstate that it is not unfair to place the defendants on trial.'' Before <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> began his investigation early last year, he received information from the presidential commission that investigated the U.S.-Iran arms sales, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which had conducted a preliminary inquiry that led to his appointment as independent counsel, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. Attached as an exhibit was a December, 1986 memo to <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities by then-Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> seeking <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s cooperation in obtaining records of the arms deals from bank accounts kept by <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. The memo states that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had already determined that an undetermined amount of the proceeds from the arms sales were not accounted for. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> also identifed conspiracy to defraud the government and wire fraud as possible offenses committed by <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. The indictment accuses all four defendants with committing those offenses. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is scheduled to hold a hearing next Tuesday on the immunity issue. He indicated in a brief opinion earlier this week that he was prepared to discuss a `` realistic trial date.''

<HEAD>Brush Fire Threat Continues Across Florida; Thousands of Acres
Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters worked Friday to contain brush fires across the state that were fueled by dry wind and burned thousands of acres of grassland, trees, bushes and shrubs. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze Thursday. No damage to buildings was reported. The largest fire destroyed 1,500 to 2,000 acres at the edge of the <ORGANIZATION> Osceola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Amison </PERSON>, spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. He said firefighters were trying to hold fire lines, <PERSON> Amison </PERSON> said. `` But there's a large unburned area inside the line, and they're not confident they'll be able to hold it if the winds pick up.'' A fire that authorities tried to contain near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION> was the biggest concern, said <PERSON> Seb </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, Division of Forestry spokesman. The fire had burned nearly 1,300 acres and endangered a residential subdivision. `` It's out of the -LRB- fire -RRB- lines,'' <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said. `` There are some structures that could be threatened. It's not a hysterical sort of thing, but it's the fire with the greatest potential.'' Because <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> remained dry Friday, with wind gusting up to 20 mph, officials expected the fire problem to continue.

 A man whose shooting of a pregnant woman resulted in the death of her baby was sentenced Friday to 15 to 30 years in prison. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, claimed he accidentally shot <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, 29, while firing into a crowd at a bully who had beaten him up. Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who underwent seven hours of surgery and was hospitalized 11 days after she was shot, wept quietly in her second-row seat as state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> pronounced sentence. `` I thank the Lord and I thank -LRB- Assistant District Attorney -RRB- <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidemann </PERSON>,'' she said. Hall was convicted March 9 of second-degree manslaughter, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and first-degree assault. The jury cleared him of murder, after finding he had not intended to harm Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, gave birth to a 2-pound-5-ounce baby, who had a heartbeat but no other vital functions. Named <PERSON> Atallah </PERSON>, she died of respiratory failure 36 hours later. Hospital officials said the baby had hyaline membrane disease, common to premature babies, and never breathed without life support equipent. The homicide case centered on whether the baby was born alive since she never breathed independently. Citing a 1949 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> decision known as the `` born alive'' ruling, defense lawyers argued unsuccessfully that since the baby never survived without mechanical life support, she could not be considered a person and Hall could not be charged with her death. The `` born alive'' ruling defines a `` person'' as one who has been fully expelled from the mother's body and had independent circulation.

<HEAD>Justice Department Challenges Independent Counsel Law in High
Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite a conflict of interest, responsibility for investigating and prosecuting alleged offenses by high administration officials must remain with the president, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> presented that argument in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> brief which challenges the constitutionality of the law under which independent counsels are appointed by a federal court to investigate wrongdoing by top executive branch officers. The system of court-appointed independent counsels grew out of the Watergate scandal and the counsels are insulated from removal except for misconduct or incapacity. `` The possibility of personal and political conflicts of interest does not justify this sort of patchwork improvement on the Constitution,'' Fried said. His brief details objections first made last year by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to the independent counsel provisions of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. `` The Constitution does not contemplate that the president may be ` disqualified' because of an impermissible ` conflict' between his chief political interest and his responsibility as chief executive,'' Fried said. `` Any such ` conflict' is intrinsic to the vesting of all executive power in an elected president,'' the 50-page brief added. It concluded that the tools supplied by the Constitution to deal with the conflict problem _ criminal prosecution by regular or special prosecutors within the executive branch, congressional investigation and impeachment _ `` have been used with success throughout our history.'' The solicitor general's brief says that the independent counsel statute unconstitutionally takes executive power from the president and violates the appointments clause of the Constitution. The limitations on removing independent counsels are inconsistent with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions and there is no precedent for vesting purely executive power in court-appointed officers, Fried concluded. The solicitor general's brief was filed in a case involving independent counsel <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, whose constitutional authority is being challenged by the target of her criminal investigation, former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> won a favorable ruling at the federal appeals court level. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> is appealing. The government's brief was filed in support of <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. Now a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> is under investigation for allegedly lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1983 <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> controversy in which the executive branch of government initially withheld documents from congressional investigating committees. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules against independent counsels, it would be unlikely to affect criminal investigations of the Iran-Contra scandal and of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Independent counsels in both those probes have accepted parallel appointments within the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a safeguard against constitutional challenges to their authority.

 A battered 3-year-old being used as a panhandling prop died just after a concerned passerby sent her to a hospital, the second death in two weeks of a toddler who lived at the city's largest welfare hotel, police said Friday. The girl's mother's boyfriend was charged with murder. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> had `` bruises and contusions on her face, back and neck. Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' police Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said at a news conference. Police questioned the girl's mother, <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, 32, who was in <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after giving birth Wednesday to her fifth child. The girl was pronounced dead Thursday evening, 20 minutes after she arrived at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, assistant chief of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> detectives. An autopsy Friday indicated the toddler died of blunt force injuries of head and abdomen with internal injuries and bleeding, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> of the city medical examiner's office. The case was officially ruled child abuse and a homicide, she said. The girl had been sent to the hospital by a man who saw her on a street corner with <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON>, 29, who had been panhandling, police said. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> was in a stroller and her 18-month-old brother was in <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON>' arms, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. `` Maya appeared to be in serious condition with trauma at least around the face,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON> had a habit of using the children to panhandle. `` He'll take two of the children of his girlfriend, put them in a stroller and go out and solicit funds in their presence,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. The passerby, who had not been identified, stopped a cab, gave the driver $ 5 and told him to take <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON> and the children to a hospital. The cab driver told police what had happened. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said police were seeking the passerby. `` We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to him about what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON> is a drug abuser with a past record who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in May 1980 with the Cuban boat lift, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. He was charged with second-degree murder, said police Officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> lived with her mother, her brother and <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON> at the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s East Side, where the city houses 463 homeless families, or about 2,600 people. The city provides housing for about 28,000 homeless people, 12,000 of them in welfare hotels and the remainder in shelters, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trazoff </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks ago, 3-year-old <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> was scalded to death in a bathtub at the hotel. His mother, <PERSON> Merian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, was charged with second-degree murder and her husband, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, was charged with assault for allegedly beating the toddler. `` These are terrible stories,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Trazoff </PERSON>. `` The Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON> has a large number of social services,'' she said. A social service office, open during daytime hours, is located in the hotel and a variety of programs are available, including preschool and day care programs, she said. When asked why no one apparently noticed that the child had been beaten, Ms. <PERSON> Trazoff </PERSON> speculated that the child's family may not have requested any social services. The spokeswoman said <ORGANIZATION> HRA </ORGANIZATION> was checking its records to see if the family had ever asked for help from the agency. The 18-month-old boy, whose name was not released, was admitted to the hospital for observation although he had no visible signs of abuse. <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> had lived together for 16 months, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>'s two other children live with relatives. The baby she had just had at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> was the first the couple had together.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> donned an olive-green field jacket for his opening salvo in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> presidential primary's battle of the airwaves `` I'm a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran _ one of the lucky ones,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> says in a new ad for television. Because of his experience, he says, he has worked `` for arms control, for peace, for a strong bargaining position with the Russians.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s experience is the focus of two new ads that began airing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week. A third, unveiled Friday, touts a commitment to education and suggests using the military against drug smugglers. On the stump Friday, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> underscored the drug theme by telling a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> audience, `` This administration declared a war against drugs and drugs won. They've got to say yes to funding for drug programs.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s new ads, with one mild exception, do not take direct aim at his opponents as did earlier commercials. `` We just do issues,'' said a senior adviser, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>. `` That's what we've been doing. That's going to continue.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has not won a contest since Super Tuesday, hopes to revive his struggling candidacy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and television ads are a key segment of his strategy. Those out this week are the first of six that are planned. But the effort may be hamstrung by the sky-high price of advertising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> media manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> has indicated discontent with the size of the campaign's TV buy. <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said ideally he would want to spend $ 2 million on TV time, but would settle for $ 1 million. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> aides said they had committed $ 500,000 and hoped for more. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign is $ 1.5 million in debt. The first two <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ads are biographical spots aimed at introducing him to voters. The field jacket ad shows him standing in front of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Vietnam War memorial as he recounts his experience and his efforts for peace; in his only reference to his opponents, he says, `` I believe no other Democrat running for president has the experience to make that fight.'' The second advertisement presents a sequence of still photos and footage _ <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and talking to voters. An announcer says: `` Vote for <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. He's got a solid record. He can win.'' In the third, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, his tie loosened, declares: `` We're losing too many kids to drugs and an inadequate education.'' Education is important to the nation's security, he says, `` and if that means using the military to help stop drugs at our borders, then let's do it.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has been more aggressive in campaign appearances, directly criticizing his opponents, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been on the air this week with biographical ads. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has bought very little ad time over the course of the campaign, was filmed campaigning in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> on Tuesday for possible advertising footage, but aides said his ad strategy for the primary was uncertain. `` It's not until April 19,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ad man <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowbray </PERSON>. `` And in the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign that's a world away.''

<TEXT>
 A special grand jury that charged 15 <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> politicians with buying slots on election ballots struck a blow against the corrupt practices that dominated elections in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for years, a prosecutor says. The practice of `` slating'' candidates and encouraging citizens to vote straight tickets has contributed to the conditions alleged in an indictment that was handed up Thursday, said special prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON>. `` I do n't see how after this anyone could run as part of a slate,'' <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON> said. Those indicted included a state senator, the county prosecutor, the mayor of <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, two county commissioners, two county school board members, three former delegates to the state assembly, one magistrate and one former magistrate, a former court clerk, a former county clerk and a former school board member who was also director of the county anti-poverty agency. The state grand jury charged the 15 with paying to be listed on Democratic slates controlled by former Sheriff <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and with using bribes and illegal campaign contributions to `` subvert the free election system.'' The indictment focused primarily on the 1984 election. A 16th defendant, state Sen. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON>, was indicted on a felony bribery charge. He is accused of accepting a bribe when he was a county commissioner to help current <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Eddie'' <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> `` buy'' the office from <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> for $ 100,000. `` I've tried all my life to live a decent life, and something like this is quite a shock,'' said one indicted man, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, a member of the county school board. `` I ca n't remember if I gave them any money, but it could n't have been any more than $ 500,'' said another of the accused, former County Clerk <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> `` I did n't think there was anything illegal about it. You go through life, and you forget these things. That's been four years ago,'' <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON> said the indictment should be a warning to other politicians who might use slates to further their positions. The grand jurors, however, blamed residents of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for the dominance of slate politics. `` This Grand Jury would urge that every citizen of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> not sell or give up their franchise or right to vote, but to exercise it without fear or purchase,'' the jury's report said. Former magistrate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said the indictments `` were blatantly political and were returned without any evidence whatsoever.'' He said he will continue his re-election campaign. Also indicted Thursday was <ORGANIZATION> Goodwill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a used car dealership at <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> owned by former county commissioner and former county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> Justice. Justice was not named as a defendant. Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CircuitCourt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> were not named in Thursday's indictments. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> pleaded guilty earlier this year in federal court to one count of bribery and three counts of tax evasion and is scheduled to be sentenced on those charges April 18. He faces sentencing on a state income tax evasion count April 19. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 13 felony counts of buying his office, helping protect a drug ring in return for illegal campaign contributions and buying and selling marijuana out of his office. He is scheduled to enter a plea to those charges on April 18. <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON> said the state grand jury will meet at least once more, on May 10, the date of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> primary, to hear evidence of any violations in that election.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> convened a secret conclave in a hilltop villa Friday to elect a new leader of the 900-year-old Roman Catholic charitable order. Thirty-six electors clad in black robes locked themselves in a third-floor room of a palazzo on the <LOCATION> Aventine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to cast ballots for a new grand master. Two of the candidates are Americans. The previous grand master, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojana </PERSON> di Cologna, died Jan. 18 at the age of 82 after 25 years as the knights' leader. The result of the election is not expected to be announced until early next week after ratification by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. A grand master, who is elected for life, carries the title of prince and `` most eminent highness.'' Equal in rank to a cardinal, he is considered the highest ranking layman in the Roman Catholic church. The order's 78th grand master will be chosen from among 22 of the electors who have attained the rank of `` Professed Knights of Justice.'' To be eligible, the new leader must have followed vows of poverty, obedience and chastity and be able to prove 200 years of nobility on the side of both parents. The group _ formally known as the Sovereign Military Order of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> and of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> _ was founded during the crusades when it opened a hospice for pilgrims in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the early 11th century. It has the status of an independent state and has diplomatic relations with 50 nations. The order has about 10,000 members, led by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with 2,800. About 2,500 members live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The knights operate about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in 90 nations, mostly in poor areas and war zones. The 36 electors, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, assembled for a morning Mass in the villa's 18th century <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> del <LOCATION> Priorato </LOCATION> church. In his homily, the prelate of the order, Archbishop <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Brini </PERSON>, said the new grand master should be `` a man of great faith, imbued with charisma of the order which Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II has not hesitated to count among the treasures of the church, a heritage which must be defended and strengthened to make it always more adaptable to the changing needs of the times.'' Following the service, the group walked in a slow procession around the church courtyard and through a passageway flanked by orange trees. The 22 Knights of Justice wore the order's eight-pointed white cross on their sleeves, while the others wore the emblem over their chests The officials then entered the villa and went to the Hall of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, where they sat at a long table covered by a red cloth. The room, which is reserved for elections of grand masters, is lined with portraits of previous leaders and has a splendid view of the capital. The 22 candidates include de Mojana's interim replacement, <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallavicini </PERSON>, a Hungarian-born American biochemist, and <PERSON> Cyrille </PERSON> <PERSON> Toumanoff </PERSON>, who was born in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Their American hometowns were not immediately available. The others are nine Italians, four Austrians, two Englishmen, two Czechoslovaks, and one each from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The rest of the council is made up of presidents of the order's associations around the world, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned Friday against travel to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens because of anti-American riots that erupted in that Central American nation. Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> declared a state of emergency in the country's two major cities, <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, after students smashed shop windows and overturned cars in the violence, sparked by the forced deportation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a Honduran suspected of drug trafficking. `` Until the situation is clarified, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> recommends that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens defer travel to any area of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said Friday that he expected no breakthroughs in trade talks next week with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>, who is leading a delegation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials for the tenth session of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he was hopeful the negotiations could lay the groundwork for expanded trade. The joint commission was formed in 1973 to bring trade agencies of the two governments together. The meetings will take place at the same time a trade delegation of 400 American businessmen will be in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks on trade opportunities. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>, who will be meeting with Soviet officials including <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would seek expanded opportunities for American companies to sell their products in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Last year, trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled $ 1.5 billion, two-thirds of that in grain sales. This represented just 0.5 percent of American export sales and was a decline from $ 4.5 billion in U.S.-Soviet trade in 1979, before President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> imposed the trade embargo after Soviet troops invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We are not going to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for any breakthroughs,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We do not expect any dramatic increase in trade to result. What we hope to do is to create a new climate and a foundation for future trade.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said he would stress that expanded trade can only take place if the Soviets make `` further improvements elsewhere in our bilateral relationship, particularly on human rights and immigration.'' Asked whether the Thursday announcement that Soviet troops would begin pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 would help the trade talks, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said he believed that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` very happy'' with the development. `` There is n't any question in my mind that if the Soviets would continue to indicate that they would like to lessen tensions, that would certainly have an effect on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>, who will leave for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, won <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> approval earlier this week for a plan to set up high-level working groups with the Soviets to spur exchanges in five areas: food processing, energy, construction equipment, medical products and the services sector, including insurance. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said it was hoped that these working groups will provide channels to develop specific markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. The meetings next week are expected to produce some agreements on the establishment of joint ventures between American companies and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The trade meetings will come six weeks before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his fourth summit conference with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 City officials are trying to shut down an advertising agency that has found a legal loophole allowing it sell babies to adoptive parents. `` For You Too: A Child from the Third World for 12,000 marks -LRB- $ 7,270 -RRB-,'' reads an advertising flier from the Frankfurt-based <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> agency. Strict laws bar private adoption agencies. `` We are completely legal,'' <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>, 32, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` All we are doing is breaking through the monopoly of state-run offices that put couples wanting to adopt through the torture of long waits and tests before they get a child.'' To circumvent the adoption law, <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> says, a prospective adoptive father declares himself the father of an illegitimate child and signs a contract with the baby's mother, who is paid to verify his claim. The adoptive father then applies to a West German court for the child to be declared his legitimate offspring, <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> said he makes about $ 3,000 as the go-between, with the rest of the fee going to the mother. `` There is nothing in our law that forbids this,'' he said. The agency sends its advertising fliers to prospective adoptive parents and gynecologists. `` I can arrange immediately for a child. The prices: 30,000 marks -LRB- $ 18,000 -RRB- for a child from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>; 15,000 marks -LRB- $ 9,000 -RRB- for a child from the Far East; 45,000 marks -LRB- $ 27,000 -RRB- for a German child,'' one flier said. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> city officials are working to shut down <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>'s office `` because it is morally and ethically wrong to profit by selling human beings,'' city spokesman <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> won a court order to shut down <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, an information office for the <ORGANIZATION> Infertility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> office is operated by American lawyer <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, who gained fame in the `` Baby M'' surrogate motherhood case. `` We closed down the <ORGANIZATION> Keane </ORGANIZATION> office last year, and in this case we also think it is morally and ethically wrong to make a profit by trading in children,'' <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON> said. The case has been getting heavy publicity. The Frankfurter Rundschau published an article about <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>'s operation under the headline, `` Businessman Deals in Babies from the Third World. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Abendpost newspaper wrote: `` <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advantage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>'s Loopholes for Scandalous Baby Trade.'' Different prices does not mean the agency considers one baby more valuable than another because of race, <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a mother is entitled to as much as 2,000 marks -LRB- $ 1,480 -RRB- per month to support herself and a child. `` A Third World mother can often support herself and a baby for about 200 marks -LRB- $ 120 -RRB- per month, depending on which country she's from,'' he added <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> said he has so far arranged the adoption of nine babies. His office has been operating for two months.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has rejected a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal to conduct tests to determine whether cruise missiles aboard ships are armed with nuclear or conventional warheads, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Friday. Kremlin leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> raised the issue at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December, saying the Soviets had a new scientific technique. And the Soviets want to include limits on sea-launched cruise missiles in a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty now under negotiation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials argue that it is impossible to verify whether ship-board cruise missiles are armed with nuclear or conventional warheads, and therefore reject making them part of the START pact. The Soviets responded by proposing a joint experiment to be conducted in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to test the new technology <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> mentioned last December. Soviet officials have not released details of the new method, but a senior administration official said March 17 that `` it seemed to be just a <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counter hanging from a helicopter.'' Such a device would be easy to fool, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, said the official, the administration `` was considering going along with the experiment, just to see what they have.'' On Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said that the proposed experiment had been rejected. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands by the commitment it made at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit to find a mutually acceptable solution to the questions of limiting the deployment of long-range nuclear armed cruise missiles and to seek mutually acceptable and effective methods of verification of such limitations,'' said the official, reading a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy statement. `` Designing a regime to verify the effective limitation of sea-launched cruise missile -LRB- SLCM -RRB- deployment is an extremely tough problem. The Soviet proposals forwarded thus far for verifying as <ORGANIZATION> SLCM </ORGANIZATION> limit simply wo n't work,'' the official said. `` That means we rejected the idea'' of a joint experiment, said the official. The administration maintains that the Soviet demand to include the sea-launched cruise missiles stands in the way of a START treaty. Soviet officials have said that a START pact could be ready for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit at the end of May, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said that the treaty is too complicated to conclude by then. A Soviet diplomat in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that question of monitoring sea-launched cruise missiles was discussed during the visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, but that `` these negotiations were supposed to be confidential.'' `` Through diplomatic channels, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side was supposed to let us know,'' said the Soviet official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He declined to give an official reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement.

 A lawyer for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> admitted Friday that his client sold cocaine, but said the son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was tricked into making the sale by an attractive female officer. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on allegations he illegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officer two years ago. The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. `` The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a regulated drug,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> in his opening statement Friday. `` This is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct.'' <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> said `` an attractive female police officer'' who had never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> into making the sale. He said it was the woman, not <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, who brought up the subject of buying drugs. When she took the stand Friday, the officer, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, was asked what she said to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> when she came to his off-campus apartment in February 1986. `` I said, ` A couple of people told me that you could sell me some coke.''' `` And what did he say?'' asked <LOCATION> Addison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` Sure,'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> as responding. She added, `` He pulled a tray from under the couch.'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> testified that the tray had on it about 15 packets of cocaine in a plastic bag, with the packets marked by weight. When questioned by <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> on her apparel that day, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said she was told to dress like a college student, and was wearing an open jean jacket, a yellow V-neck sweater and jeans. She said she was hesitant to take the assignment because she had never done an undercover job. She said she was given instructions on what to wear and what to say. `` Did they tell you to ask for cocaine?'' <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> asked her. `` Yes,'' replied Manning. After <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s testimony, the trial was adjourned until Saturday. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> conceded in his opening argument that <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> was inexperienced, but asked jurors to keep in mind that the <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is a low-budget, small-town operation. `` We do n't have huge resources in the state,'' he said, adding it was even difficult for police to come up with $ 30 for the purchase. The prosecutor painted a picture of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> as a well-organized drug dealer. He said that when <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> asked to buy cocaine, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> pulled a tray from under his couch with 15 packets of the drug. `` When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the good merchant that he is ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives it to <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> also said a detective began investigating <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> after a note was left on his desk with <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s name, address, car registration and the words `` The Pharmacist.'' Prosecutors and police have said <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was known at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> as `` the pharmacist'' because of his reputation as a drug dealer. The detective, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wemette </PERSON>, was the first witness. He testified he had first heard rumors of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s drug dealing in 1984, but that he did not pursue them because <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> left to help his mother's campaign. Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986, at <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s off-campus apartment. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was arrested a few days later after police searched his car and apartment. Opening arguments followed four days of jury selection, a task slowed by wide publicity. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, have been sitting side by side behind their son in court. The jury is being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press accounts of the trial.

<HEAD>Report Says Expedition Finds Classical Greek Texts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An expedition leader said Friday that archaeologists in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> have dug up what may prove to be the earliest complete versions of three classical Greek texts, at least one of them by <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>. Professor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said his Canadian team found two books dating from the late third century A.D., one literary and one containing farm accounts, while excavating the remains of the post-Hellenic town of Isment in the <LOCATION> Dakhla </LOCATION> Oasis in central <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The literary manuscript contains a treatise on politics, apparently by the philosopher <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>; an essay on kingship by <PERSON> Isocrates </PERSON>, his 4th-century B.C. contemporary; and an unidentified text that could be one of <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>'s lost works, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. The earliest complete texts of writings by <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> and Isocrates that survive in museums today date from the 10th century, a British expert said. The original works of classical Greek scholars have vanished. What survives are usually separated from the authors' lifetimes by hundreds of years of copying and re-copying by scribes. The new discoveries could bring scholars more than six centuries closer to the lost originals and eliminate what the Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> described Friday as `` generations of slips of the pen.'' The books, measuring 4-by-10 inches, each has eight or nine wooden pages one-eighth of an inch thick, said <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 51, an Egyptologist affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, leader of a 25-member museum expedition that travels to the <LOCATION> Dakhla </LOCATION> Oasis every winter, said the books were found in mid-January. They are written in ancient Greek with a split-reed pen, bound on one side and held together with the original strings, he said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Bodmin </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` The books are in excellent condition, the wood is good and hard and the writing is very clear,'' he said. `` The one with literary text is written in a very clear, very small and very precise hand. I would guess there would be 60 lines on each page, and writing on both sides of the page.'' The farm manuscript lists local tenant farmers and their commodities over a four-year period, he said. The expedition of zoologists, botanists, ceramics experts and others examining the links between human activity and the environment in Isment were short of a classicist at the time of the discovery. He said they sent for <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, a French specialist in ancient Greek texts who was working in an expedition at the nearby <LOCATION> Kharga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oasis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and a Danish colleague who accompanied him said the writing seemed like <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>'s but could not be sure if it was a manuscript that was already known, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. He said research was being conducted. `` They were very excited,'' he said. `` It's a marvelous find, a very rare find. There's so much that's new and incontrovertible in this work. The information is so clearly stated.'' The books were found about six feet below the surface and three feet above the floor of a house and may have been accidentally dropped, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. `` We wondered that perhaps they fell out of somebody's saddlebags as they were going by'' in the 4th or 5th century, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said The town had been abandoned and was eventually buried by sand dunes around the sixth century, he said. The unidentified text could be one of <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>'s lost works, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. Of abvout 150 named works that <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> left, fewer than 30 survive in more than fragmentary form. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattie </PERSON>, a papyrologist at the British Library, said few texts by <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> have been found in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and most are written on papyrus, a water plant used by the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Romans to make writing materials. `` This is written on wood _ not so many have been found _ and was possibly for school use,'' <PERSON> Pattie </PERSON> said in an interview. The earliest surviving fragmentary manuscript containing an Aristotle work, `` The Constitution of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>,'' dates from the first century A.D. and is written on papyrus. `` There are several fragments from the second century and this is apparently from the third century but it may be more substantial,'' he said. `` It might turn out to be very important indeed. These complete texts could be about 600 years older that the next oldest full texts.''

 Riot police used clubs and jets of water to stop a protest outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound Friday by about 3,000 people demanding an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Officers attacked when some demonstrators broke away from the main group and dashed for the heavily guarded embassy. Some people in the crowd threw stones at police. Leaders of the Campaign for a <ORGANIZATION> Sovereign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the protest, were negotiating with police when the young men ran toward the embassy. Police Capt. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolosa </PERSON> said the protesters had no permit to demonstrate in front of the embassy but were allowed to hold a rally nearby. During the march to the embassy, members of the crowd chanted `` Dismantle the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. bases!'' and `` Down with imperialism!'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> began negotiations Tuesday on the status of American military bases, which include the huge <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay naval base. The leases expire in 1991. Before Friday's march, the Campaign for a <ORGANIZATION> Sovereign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> sponsored a `` <ORGANIZATION> Parallel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bases </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>.'' It issued a statement Friday urging the government to end the agreement in 1991 and demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comply immediately with a law banning nuclear weapons from its Philippine territory. The group recommended salary and compensation hikes for the nearly 70,000 Filipino base employees and creation of a study group to determine alternate future uses for the installations. The six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases make up the largest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> installation left in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, head of the American negotiating panel, says they are essential to protect the region. Philippine authorities are expected to demand substantial increases in the amount of money <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pays to use the bases. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, chief Filipino negotiator, said last month an annual fee of $ 1.2 billion was reasonable.

 Eighteen British hostages freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti airliner got an emotional greeting from their families and an official government welcome when they landed at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Friday. They were brought home by a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet diverted from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to pick them up. <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalker </PERSON>, a Foreign Office minister, met them at the aircraft door and led them to a VIP lounge where about 40 relatives waited. `` Everyone was charging around the lounge trying to find their family,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, 23. He was returning from a vacation in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> with his sister <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> and family friend <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Silcock </PERSON>, 21, when the plane was hijacked early Tuesday and landed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` There was a lot of hugging,'' he said. `` There was laughing and crying. It was a great welcome back.'' Miss <PERSON> Silcock </PERSON> said she would celebrate her return with champagne and a cheddar cheese sandwich, the thought of which had `` kept me going throughout the last few days.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, 26, hugged his mother and said: `` It's fantastic to be back. The only thing I thought about when I was there was my family, and now that I am with them again it is wonderful.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chalker </PERSON> said: `` We learned the lesson that firmness does pay. We have to resist further hijacks.'' Some passengers, looking pale and drawn, left the airport quickly after the reunion, escorted by police, government officials and airport security to their cars. Some leaned on the arms of relatives. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was in such a hurry to leave the airport that he nearly missed his waiting family and friends. Passengers said the hijacking was a frightening experience, but the gunmen were considerate of the passengers, giving them blankets, pillows, food and water. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON>, a 23-year-old photographer, said: `` We were n't harmed They seemed very well trained. I do n't think they are afraid to die.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carew-Jones </PERSON>, 32, said, `` They did n't actually physically maltreat anybody. On the contrary, they were very attentive. But you always had to remember that they had a hand grenade in one hand and a gun in another and they were wearing hoods. ... I mean, there was always menace. `` It could get quite relaxed and they would allow you to talk, go to the toilet, converse with people _ then suddenly, about once every two or three hours, they would put the lights out, saying ` No talking,' and they would stand at the front and scan you with torches -LRB- flashlights -RRB-. `` You kept thinking that every time the torch fell on your face it was somehow significant. That I found frightening.'' The hijackers, who demand that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 Shiite Moslems convicted and imprisoned for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983, have released 33 men and 24 women. A total of 55 people, including the hijackers, remained on the plane Friday.

<TEXT>
 A federal jury spent hours poring over hundreds of documents Friday as it began deliberating the fate of a scholar accused of trying to sell historic letters and papers taken from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The jurors quit for the weekend after they spent four hours considering the case of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, charged with interstate transportation of stolen documents, including some signed by President <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>. Mount, who was born <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchow </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> but speaks with the accent of a British gentleman, faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. In closing arguments Friday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> stole the papers and removed their identifying marks. Mount, a respected biographer and <ORGANIZATION> Guggenheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> fellow, claims the documents were his. Mount's public defender, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON>, said the government tried to paint <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> as a thief because the transportation charge was hard to support. <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> also said bookkeeping at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was too spotty to prove those institutions ever owned the documents. He said it was only after <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> was arrested that the government began to gather a case against him. Although Mount has not been charged with theft, the government contends that <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> took the papers. `` What problem do they have alleging theft?'' <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> asked the jurors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s court. `` Plenty.'' Mount, who is 59 and favors a gray bowler hat, a British accent he attributes to Irish neighbors in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and dapper suits from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, says he was impoverished after the government seized his savings. During the trial he lodged at a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> until Thursday, when the judge found him in contempt of court. She sent him to jail for the rest of the trial after he twice asked the prosecutor `` have you no shame?'' The finding was lifted Friday afternoon and <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> returned to the Y, <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> said. Mount is accused of selling a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bookshop letters written by artist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> that belonged to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He was arrested while allegedly trying to sell letters and papers taken from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and signed by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and Civil War generals. Mount maintained that he bought the <LOCATION> Whistler </LOCATION> papers at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> shops in the 1950s and 1960s and that a priest in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> gave him the Civil War papers in a cookie tin in 1961. The defense noted that Mount over the years donated many of his papers to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He has written biographies of painters <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, and held a Guggenheim fellowship in 1956.

 Here is the text of a statement read Friday by television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who was defrocked by the Assemblies of God: I wish to express to all the state and national officials of the Assemblies of God my sincere appreciation for the kindness and consideration they have shown me in the midst of a very trying situation. They have conducted themselves as Christian gentlemen. We appreciate that. I would like to believe that I understand the difficulties and problems the Assemblies of God officials face, respecting the guidelines for rehabilitation. I have tried to put myself in their shoes and I can find no fault with the decision. Admittedly I had hoped the decision would have gone in another direction, but I do understand their reasoning. We are seeking God almost continuously and, of course, our immediate concern is to salvage the ministry. We believe that to stay out of the pulpit for a year would totally destroy the television ministry and greatly adversely impact the college. Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to take a position that does not answer all the questions nor solve all the problems, but we feel we have no alternative or choice. Therefore, I must regretfully withdraw from the Assemblies of God, understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss me from the fellowship since I am presently not in good standing with the fellowship. Even though it is a moot point at this time, I continue to abide by the original directives of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. This in no way is meant to imply rebellion against the decision of the General Presbytery. I greatly appreciate the kindness and consideration shown to me by the brethern of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district. I ask that the supporters of this ministry and the ministers of the Assembly of God remember us in prayer. Our position will not be easy and it will take a miracle of God for the situation to improve. I want all concerned to know that I in no way mean to place myself in a position of defying the Assemblies of God or its officers. That is not my intention in any way. I will never say a derogatory thing about the Assemblies of God. We would never want to do anything that would prove harmful to this great fellowship. I love this Assemblies of God fellowship that I have been associated with for so long. I still feel it is among the greatest fellowships on the face of the earth. It is our every intention to be of service as much as possible. I would pray that my ministry can continue to channel many of the souls <PERSON> God </PERSON> would help us to win into Assemblies of God churches. They could have no better home. I will always be Assemblies of God in spirit and in doctrine and even though what help we can give will be from a distance we will continue to do what we can. I sincerely apologize to the officials of the Assemblies of God and all its ministers of the Gospel for any and all concerns and burdens that have come about because of my personal failure. Mere words do not help much and I wish it were possible to erase the ledger and start over again but of course it is not. Perhaps in God's gracious wisdom and his loving kindness he will help us to solve problems regarding the continuation of the ministry God has given us. These problems are unsolvable without God's help.

 Soldiers wounded nine Arabs in street battles after weekly Moslem prayers Friday, and a firebomb was hurled at the home of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate official in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but no one was injured. Most protests dispersed quickly on what proved one of the quieter Moslem sabbaths in four months of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> unrest. Consulate spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said the firebomb was tossed at 7:30 p.m. while his 5-year-old daughter and two maids were in the house. He said it damaged the porch but caused no injuries. A guard protecting the house was in the back of the building at the time of the attack, <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said. He said consulate officials decided to provide him with a guard several days ago because of growing tensions in the area. Arab youths chanted anti-Israeli slogans, raised black mourning flags and threw rocks at soldiers after services at mosques in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which have been swept by violence since Dec. 8. A prayer leader at the sacred <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque condemned the peace plan of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` It is known that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not give people their true rights,'' said <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siam </PERSON>. A military official said the army continued investigating the death of a 15-year-old Jewish girl in a clash with Arabs on Wednesday. It was first reported that the girl, <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, died from a stone thrown by Arabs. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, citing an army investigation, said Friday she apparently was shot to death. Results of the army probe leaked to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV and radio indicated she may have been shot inadvertently by an Israeli. Arab hospital officials reported nine Palestinians wounded by soldiers Friday in four separate clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The largest toll was at the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where worshipers emerged from a mosque and marched to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military base. Palestinian reports said they hurled rocks at soldiers, who responded with tear gas and gunfire, wounding five. On <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, the sacred hill Arabs call <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, dozens of Palestinians chanted nationalist slogans after noon prayers at <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> and paraded with a black flag to mourn Arabs killed in the violence. At least 141 Palestinians have died since Dec. 8, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was stabbed to death and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was the first Israeli civilian killed. `` With our blood and spirit, we will redeem you, Palestine!'' the demonstrators at <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> chanted. Youngsters threw rocks at border police perched on rooftops with sniper rifles, but were dispersed without incident. Inside the mosque, prayer leader <PERSON> Siam </PERSON> urged worshipers to reject the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative. `` Give yourselves to <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>, but not to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Siam </PERSON> said. `` He is not the person to decide what is good and what is bad for us.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ummar </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, an army bulldozer plowed into shops after a demonstration, said <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Natshe </PERSON>, the former mayor of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. Army officials said they had no report of the incident. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> headed home Friday after an unsuccessful five-day effort to arrange negotiations between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders. Palestinians accused him of trying to crush the rebellion with his peace effort. A senior military official said Friday the army still had not determined what killed <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, who was on a Passover holiday hike with other teen-age children of Jewish settlers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Two Arabs also were killed, and two Arabs and 13 Israelis injured. `` We know she was struck by a bullet and a stone,'' the official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The exact cause of death is not known.'' According to an army report leaked to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> radio and television, the clash began when 16 teen-agers and their two guards were stoned by youths from <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, an Arab town. The radio quoted the report as saying the guards disagreed over what to do. It said <PERSON> Romam </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>, 26, wanted to shoot but the other guard asked him not to. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> told the children to gather around him and started shooting, the radio said, then the Arab youths disarmed him and took the Israelis to <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>. A large crowd attacked the Israelis in the town, reports have said, but the army stressed that many villagers helped the teen-agers. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports have identified <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> as a follower of the anti-Arab Kach movement of U.S.-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, quoting a ranking military source it did not identify, said the bullet in Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>'s head was fired from the gun of one of the Israeli guards but it was not known who pulled the trigger. The army said a <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> resident on Friday handed <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>'s M-16 rifle to a soldier, and TV reports said eight bullets were still in the magazine. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted an army report as saying Ms. <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was also struck in the head by a rock hurled by the mother and sister of an Arab killed in the clash. The two women are under arrest, the report was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> remained under curfew Friday. The army said soldiers demolished eight more homes of suspects, bringing the two-day total to 13.

 Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen claimed victory in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Friday after four days of clashes with rival Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fighters which left 62 dead and 150 wounded, police said Friday. The Syria-backed Amal militia led by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> apparently had battled the more militant <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> won the key town of <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stronghold, in a sweeping attack Thursday after its fighters took control of the inland market town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>. Police said two West German relief workers who were held captive for 14 hours by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> were freed Thursday when Amal militiamen took <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>. The Amal commander in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Faqih </PERSON>, said the crackdown on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> was `` inevitable.'' `` They were harrassing the population, kidnapping innocent people and confiscating property owned by the Christians,'' a minority in the area, <PERSON> Faqih </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his bullet-riddled office in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> forces, loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, remained entrenched in three hamlets west of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> mediators negotiating terms for their surrender. Trouble between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> began Feb. 17, when Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who commands <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce observers, was kidnapped near Tyre and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> rounded up dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members it accused of involvement. Shiite militants loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are believed to hold most of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who include nine Americans. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. The West Germans, who work for a West German humanitarian organization identified as Asme Humanitas, disappeared after leaving the Palestinian refugee camp of <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> Wednesday morning, police said. They were identified as <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Strubig </PERSON>, 47, the director of the organization in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>, and his assistant, <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> suffered bullet shrapnel cuts on one hand and burns from another bullet that grazed her left wrist. She told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that she and <PERSON> Strubig </PERSON> were riding in an ambulance to distribute food and medicine when they were stopped. `` We were intercepted by armed men in at least two cars, who fired several shots over our vehicle,'' she said. Police said the West Germans had been held in the basement of a mosque.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called anew on Friday for a multinational force to combat global drug trafficking. He addressed a news conference in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> following his arrival in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> on Thursday night. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> canceled a visit Friday to an anti-drug operations site in the Ecuadorean <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle and instead toured a police academy. He is scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, on Saturday for a meeting with President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> before traveling on to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is accompanied by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, on a fact-finding mission to measure the success of Latin American nations' efforts to halt cocaine trafficking. He told reporters Friday the proposal for a multinational anti-drug force was `` favorably received'' in his meetings with government officials in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> before coming here. `` This is an idea that has a lot of merit and should be explored in the future,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials say <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s role in cocaine trafficking is less significant than that of its Andean neighbors. Production of coca leaf, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is on a minor scale in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. But in recent years international drug smugglers have begun using this small nation, wedged between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, as an important transshipment point. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is the world's largest grower of coca leaf. Most of its production is partially refined and smuggled into <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where the drug is refined into pure cocaine for export to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European markets. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is the second biggest grower and a major refiner as well. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have praised <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> for his commitment to the battle against drugs, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has increased funding for the fight.

 An opposition leader who led a huge rally against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month has been released from prison and ordered out of the country, his lawyer said Friday. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, 49, was freed Thursday night after being held for 10 days in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Modelo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> following his arrest March 28 when police stopped the protest march he was leading. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON>, his attorney, said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> would stay at the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> until leaving Sunday with his wife, <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> for exile in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. `` There was no other remedy,'' said <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> faced a long prison term on a sedition charge filed by the government last summer if he did not accept exile. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the civilian government. He has been indicted on narcotics trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has supported a 10-month-old opposition campaign to oust him. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration invoked more economic sanctions Friday on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including a tighter freeze on Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although assets already were frozen by court order sought by the administraton, the new action has the effect of law and prevents <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from overturning the freeze by appealing the court order. The new sanctions also include prohibiting payments to the regime by all people and organizations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and organizations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The previous sanctions, which included the withholding of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, created a severe cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was free on bond on the sedition charge when he was arrested during the demonstration that preceded a police raid on an opposition headquarters at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel. In all, more than 40 people were picked up in the sweep, including eight foreign journalists. The reporters were freed within hours and most of the others were released the next day. But the government kept <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> in custody and refused to let anyone except his wife visit him. She said he had been beaten. `` They never filed -LRB- new -RRB- charges against <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON>. `` But state security adduced -LRB- his guilt -RRB- from a photo of Carlos Ernesto carrying a flag in the March 28 demonstration that was published in a North American newspaper.'' A former director of the now-closed opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was ordered into exile in 1976 by Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who preceded <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> spent two years in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> before being allowed to return. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is one of 35 directors of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of some 200 business, labor, professional and political groups that has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since last June. Carrying a large Panamanian flag, he led the march last month that police and soldiers broke up with tear gas, shotguns and rubber truncheons. About 10,000 people took part in the protest. Since last month's demonstration, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime has harassed and briefly detained a number of other opposition leaders, surrounding the homes of at least three of them with state security agents for periods of up to 12 hours. Most leaders of the Civic Crusade have kept a low profile. News conferences, which used to be held almost daily, have been replaced by telephone calls and communiques slipped into the hotel message boxes of reporters. NOriegas government's new, get-tough policy appeared in part to be a defiant answer to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and diplomatic moves aimed at fortifying the internal opposition's efforts to remove the general. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration completed a 1,300-man military build-up in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Thursday. The new troops brought to 11,800 the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel guarding the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, which has operated normally throughout the crisis, and protecting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens living in the country. About 800 Marines arrived Friday from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for three weeks of jungle warfare training that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said had nothing to do with the build-up of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The command is responsible for all American military operations in Central and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning across the city boroughs, said Friday he had `` sent a message no one can miss'' to allay concerns that he harbors anti-Semitic feelings, and he moved to counter criticism that he lacks the government experience to be president. `` Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of anti-Semitism, or sexism,'' he said, and in one appearance he described the link between blacks and Jews during the civil rights movement. Growing up in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` it was commonplace to see signs that said ` blacks and Jews and dogs are not welcome.''' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will not, however, meet with a Jewish umbrella group to address their concerns, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had sought such a meeting, but <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could not take the time from his campaign for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s April 19 primary. `` We've already answered all these questions. I do n't see why we have to go to a meeting to answer all the questions again,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said outside of a fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Wading </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We're talking to the people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A lot of them happen to be Jewish. We are talking about issues that are important to us as opposed to the issues that are important to one group of people,'' he added. Concerning his lack of experience in office, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a senior citizens forum in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> that he would recruit government officials to his administration and `` put together a competent and credible management team'' and cabinet. `` Some office holders are not leaders and some leaders are not office holders,'' he said. `` ... I am a leader.'' One of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s two Democratic rivals, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told the same forum that he does not intend to stop making experience an issue in the campaign. He cited his own credentials as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and leader on various legislative matters of concern to the seniors. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> listed various economic proposals: to freeze the military budget, create a merger review board for corporate mergers and invest public pension funds in housing construction projects. In earlier remarks, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> discussed black-Jewish bonds during the civil rights struggle of the 1960s. In a breakfast speech to union officials at <ORGANIZATION> Sardi </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s theater district, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that during his youth in the South, `` It was commonplace to see signs that said ` blacks and Jews and dogs are not welcome.''' He also spoke of people who were killed during the civil rights years. He cited the shooting deaths of three white civil rights workers in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in the early 1960s, pointedly noting that two of them were Jewish. Many Jewish voters, a large and active voting bloc in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s critical April 19 primary, oppose <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland and were alienated by his 1984 use of the offensive term `` Hymietown'' to describe <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Moreover, they are wary of his previous association with <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, who called <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> a `` dirty religion.'' Asked how he would respond to that resistance, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters, `` We continue to build relationships. We continue to heal relationships. Ours is an inclusive outreach campaign.'' Additionally, he said Jews are among many minority and ethnic groups he has involved in his campaign. At the senior citizens forum at <ORGANIZATION> Adelphi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, a woman asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to comment on the lack of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was killing Jewish people during World War II. `` We did not act quickly,'' at that time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied. `` We did abandon many Jewish people to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s hell. It was a tragic mistake.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went on to mention two issues of key importance to Jewish voters. He said <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must fight for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate, and for the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist and be assured of security. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose once poor campaign has seen a dramatic boost in fund-raising, took a veiled swipe at the fat checkbook of rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, telling the labor breakfast, `` You can have the greatest fund raisers going, and no message and no vision _ and then what.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also spoke to an enthusiastic crowd at a high school in <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. About 1,000 youth, including band members in bright green and gold, crowded in the hall to applaud his call for excellence in academics

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, reaching out to Jewish primary voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Friday he was trying to `` heal relationships'' that frayed during his 1984 presidential campaign. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his own nomination secure, surveyed the Democratic race and said `` I would n't trade'' places. The Democrats focused on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and its April 19 turning-point primary with 255 delegates, with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> both waging war on drugs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, was asked by reporters about his relationship with the Jewish community, severely strained since he referred to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' during his 1984 presidential bid. `` Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of anti-Semitism, or sexism ...,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We've sent a message no one can miss.'' A poll released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was supported by just 9 percent of Jewish voters. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 68 percent of Jews surveyed, while Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was favored by 10 percent. Jews make up one-fourth of the voters expected to cast ballots in the state's contest. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not say whether he has agreed to meet with Jewish groups, but he said, `` We continue to build relationships, we continue to heal relationships.'' However, his campaign manager said late Friday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will not meet with a Jewish umbrella group to address their concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had sought such a meeting, but campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could not take the time for the meeting. `` We've already answered all these questions. I do n't see why we have to go to a meeting to answer all the questions again,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has alienated Jews by endorsing a homeland for Palestinians and because of his close relationship with <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader who has called <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> a `` gutter religion.'' Asked what his relationship with <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> is today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We do not have one. It is precisely that.'' One of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s antagonists, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, defended his comment that Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are saying <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> ca n't say these things,'' the mayor said. `` What do you think a political campaign is? A political campaign is divisive. Somebody's got to win and somebody's got to lose.'' Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among likely Democratic voters by 47 percent to 31 percent, with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> receiving support from 6 percent. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who has not endorsed any of the Democratic hopefuls, said the poll indicated to him that it might be a tight race because he expected both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to continue to pick up support. As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, `` I do n't know how much room there is to go.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also revealed that he has already voted by absentee ballot for one of the candidates, but refused to say which one. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> waged war on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's drug war during their campaign stops. `` This administation declared a war against drugs and drugs won,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION>. `` They've got to say yes to funding for drug programs.'' `` I'd wage a real war, not a phony war, on drugs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told senior citizens. `` We've got to get tough on the flow of drugs into this country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was out on the road again, touring an aircraft assembly plant in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and attending several fund-raisers during a two-day swing through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is virtually assured his party's nomination after <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dropped out and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> severely scaled back his campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't think the Democratic infighting would last into the fall campaign. `` I wish I thought the Democrats would have a unity problem but I do n't think they will. I'm not counting on the blood on the floor that exists on this moment to carry over and cause the Democrats to hemorrhage to death,'' he said. Asked if he minded not having the discipline of a primary contest, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm delighted it's worked out the way it has. You offset staying in the news through combat by the luxury that comes with having the time to deal with issues. I would n't trade, let's put it that way.'' In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, said some party leaders are beginning to throw their support to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirwan </PERSON> had urged the 300 members of the state party committee on Thursday to choose one of the three presidential contenders. `` After yesterday, I got a clear sense of some movement to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>. `` By next Monday or Tuesday, we'll have a much better feeling for that. Maybe there'll be a bandwagon effect -LRB- for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB-, but you may have a backlash reaction.'' Later Friday, however, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> at a news conference said he did not care whether Democratic leaders endorsed candidates or not. `` I did not offer instruction to people that they must endorse or should endorse. Why should I? I have n't endorsed myself. I'm not instructing or suggesting.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he was in discussions with the three candidates about making campaign appearances with them all, time permitting. `` I'll go anywhere with them,'' he said Some Democrats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are backing an uncommitted slate of delegates to the party's national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July in hopes of generating a draft of <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to be the presidential nominee. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said he does not want to be the candidate. But he has refused to endorse any of the three contending Democrats, and has not ruled out accepting a draft for the nomination if the convention is deadlocked. Another prominent Democrat who has counted himself out of the presidential race, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, indicated Friday that he has had no second thoughts about his decision. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who announced last year that he would not be a candidate, conceded that it would be difficult to turn down a presidential draft at the convention. But at a town meeting in <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, he said, `` I have n't even thought about that I guarantee you I have n't spent 10 seconds thinking about somebody drafting me.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Form International Body Against Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawyers from 12 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, announced the formation Friday of a group that will work to outlaw nuclear weapons and offer help in disarmament programs. The new organization brought American, European, East bloc and Asian jurists' associations together under one umbrella to coordinate activities against nuclear warfare. Soviet, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Swedish attorneys were elected co-chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> against Nuclear Arms, or <PERSON> ILANA </PERSON>. The group mirrored the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which linked Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctors in a campaign that earned them the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. The jurists, ending a two-day conference, said anyone contributing to the nuclear arms race could be held accountable in the same way that Nazi officers were convicted of crimes against humanity by the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sucharev </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> and a former justice minister of the Russian republic, said the ultimate goal `` is to outlaw nuclear arms ... possibly through changes in the constitutions of our countries.'' <PERSON> Sucharev </PERSON>, a co-chairman, said the organization also could offer to help monitor the verification of arms control agreements. Speaking through a translator, he said his participation in the founding conference reflected `` new thinking'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> co-chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the organization may help defend arrested anti-nuclear activists and could sponsor cases at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in The Hague. It also could launch multinational research projects into the legal aspects of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space defense program called `` Star Wars'' and the possible interpretations of arms control treaties, he said. The group believes that nuclear weapons violate international laws banning the threat of indiscriminate force and the use of weapons against non-military targets, said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Policy. `` It is ironic that the two most powerful countries in the world rely for their security on an illegal institution, namely nuclear weapons,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. Asked if he agreed that nuclear weapons in the Soviet arsenal also were illegal, <PERSON> Sucharev </PERSON> said, `` the reality is that nuclear weapons exist,'' and said that they should be outlawed. Co-chairman <PERSON> Stig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON>, a member of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the association will be financed by donations from its member organizations and by contributions.

<TEXT>
 Television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> on Friday announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for `` moral failure.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said at a news conference that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but separating from the church to save his Bible college and $ 140 million-a-year worldwide ministry. Shortly before <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> made his announcement, the Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies of God, headquartered in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to stop preaching for a year. It had ordered the punishment after <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit Feb. 21, after a tearful public confession of `` moral failure'' before his wife, son and congregation gathered in his Family Worship Center. Church officials and <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> have refused to elaborate on his misstep, but a <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> prostitute has said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to pose nude for him. `` We believe that to stay out of the public for a year would totally destroy the television ministry and greatly adversely impact the college,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to take a position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve all of the problems. But we feel we have no alternative or choice,'' he said. `` Therefore, I must regretfully withdraw from the Assemblies of God, understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss me from the fellowship, since I am presently not in good standing with the fellowship.'' He read from a prepared statement and refused to answer questions. In <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhouse </PERSON>, assistant superintendent of the Assemblies of God, said general presbytors had read <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s statement before he made it public, so there was nothing surprising in it. <PERSON> Stenhouse </PERSON> said the church and <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> parted on amicable terms, but <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s chances of returning to the church were slim. `` It would be a long trail back ... if at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in the statement that he hoped his college and preaching would continue to send people into the Assemblies of God. He said he would stick to the punishment decided by the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> church officials, although it was moot. Under that punishment he would not preach sermons until May 22, although he has been `` witnessing'' at church services. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>, was asked if the statement meant <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> would form his own church. `` This ministry is an independent church and always has been,'' Treeby said. Asked if any of the Christian television networks had contacted them about taking <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> off the air, he said, `` We have people who handle that. We're not going to deal with that. If some of them do n't use us, they wo n't.'' The church's decision to dismiss <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> as a minister was announced in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> by the Rev. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, general superintendent of the church, after he and other members of the Executive Presbytery met by telephone conference call. Earlier Friday, the church had received what <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> described as a `` gracious'' letter from <LOCATION> Swaggart </LOCATION> in which the evangelist refused to accept terms of a church-ordered, two-year rehabilitation program. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said he called <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> on Friday after the 13-member Executive Presbytery, which serves as the board of directors of the church, met and made its decision. `` He received it graciously,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` We had prayer together at the conclusion of our conversation.'' In the statement he read, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> referred to remarks <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> made in a column in his magazine, The Evangelist, in August 1987. In it, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> endorsed a one-year ban from preaching as part of the rehabilitation of any `` fallen churchman.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> declined to release details of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s letter. He said that when he talked to him, the evangelist did not explain why he was refusing the rehabilitation program. The leaders of the country's largest Pentecostal denomination and their most prominent minister had been locked in an impasse since an attorney announced last week that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> would defy a church-directed one-year preaching ban and return to his televised ministry May 22. Church elders in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> originally recommended that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> be barred from his pulpit for three months as part of a two-year rehabilitation plan despite protests from national leaders that every other Assemblies minister who had confessed to moral failure was banned from preaching for at least a year. The Executive Presbytery recommended the one-year ban and stood firm through a challenge to its authority by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials. On March 29, the Executive Presbytery's authority to discipline <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, and the specifics of its rehabilitation plan, were endorsed by an oversight body, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials later reconciled themselves to the national plan. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s church, television and school complex in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> has been shaken by the scandal. Donations are reported down, about 100 workers were fired shortly after <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s confession, and students at the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> are said to be clamoring to transfer to other religious institutions. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry brought in an estimated $ 142 million last year, and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries. The Assemblies of God received about $ 12 million a year, in monthly increments of $ 1 million or so, from <LOCATION> Swaggart </LOCATION> for its foreign missions program. It has not received anything since his February confession. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has been known for his harsh denunciations of the sins of others, including <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who lost his Assemblies credentials after a sex-and-money scandal last year, the Rev. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, reportedly hired the men who photographed <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> with the woman. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, also defrocked by the Assemblies, said the action Friday involving <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> `` further proves the truth of the allegations I made'' in a $ 17 million lawsuit he filed against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> in March 1987. In the lawsuit, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> for destroying <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s ministry.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> declared a state of emergency Friday in the country's two major cities after students smashed shop windows and overturned cars in new anti-American riots. The presidential press office said the emergency gives police and security agencies wide powers to search premises, make arrests and hold people without trials in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the capital, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, 120 miles to the north. It also bars street demonstrations and empowers police to restrict travel. The violence broke out after thousands of students filled the streets Friday, shouting slogans protesting the forced deportation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a Honduran suspected of drug trafficking. So many students had left their classrooms by early afternoon that 100 schools and both universities in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> shut their doors. Shopowners boarded their windows in fear of more violence like the attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in the capital the night before in which five people were killed. But looters smashed shop windows, and angry demonstrators flipped over cars. Police patrols, backed by military helicopters, sped through the downtown area Friday, picking up young people. The government, the principal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said would `` will take all necessary actions to maintain order and tranquility.'' Earlier, officials forced country's 140 radio stations into a nationwide hookup Friday controlled by the presidential press office. In a communique repeatedly being read over the new network, the government urged people to `` repudiate violence'' and `` remain calm,'' claiming the violence was being secretly instigated by drug barons, who were not named. Troops and anti-riot police armed with pistols and submachine guns stopped pedestrians throughout the capital Friday afternoon and arrested those without their national identification cards. The heavy police presence prevented protesters from staging prolonged demonstrations. About 1,000 students who planned a protest near the president's office at about 4 p.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EDT -RRB- scattered as a large contingent of riot police arrived. No one was arrested. One government official, speaking on condition he was not identified, said that `` numerous persons have been detained and remain in public security jails.'' He did not give a number. A tense calm prevailed in the capital Friday night. Army tanks rumbled through the deserted streets. About 2,000 university students attacked two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy annex buildings Thursday night and set both ablaze. They were dispersed with bullets, beatings and tear gas. Police said five people were killed, four men and a young girl, and at least 10 wounded. No Americans were injured. About 25 automobiles belonging to embassy personnel were doused with gasoline and set afire Thursday. The students were protesting the arrest and delivery to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week of a Honduran accused of drug trafficking and involvement in the killing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agent. They also expressed anger at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dispatch of additional American troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last month. Beginning at dawn Friday, <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> met almost continuously with his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the armed forces chief. On Tuesday, soldiers and police took <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballasteros </PERSON> from his luxurious <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> home before dawn and hustled him onto a plane to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport. <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> officials put <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on a New York-bound flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, held at the maximum-security federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for questioning in the 1985 slaying in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. Honduran legislators called the incident a `` kidnapping'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> launched an investigation. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the constitution forbids the extratition of Honduran citizens. Student protesters also were demonstrating against the presence of 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last month. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dispatched them at <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s request after a reported incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by Nicaraguan troops pursuing Contra rebels. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s capture followed the departure of the American military contingent by less than a week. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is a cornerstone of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops have held joint exercises with the Honduran military on a regular basis for five years. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Friday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was puzzled by amount of time it took police to arrive on the scene Thursday evening. `` We do not understand the slow response. We are highly concerned over the threat this posed to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Honduran lives and the destruction of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> property,'' she said, and the matter had been taken up with Honduran authorities. About 20 Honduran guards on duty at the embassy compound opened fire with sawed-off shotguns Thursday night, according to police, but the students got into the parking lot. Riot squads, totaling about 50 men, did not arrive until about two hours later.

 <LOCATION> WINDHOEK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> came to <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> with senior members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for talks with leaders of the territorial government, many of whom are demanding abolition of all apartheid-style legislation. Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a prominent foe of apartheid, and other southern African Anglican bishops also are here for a weeklong visit that includes church services in the densely populated far north of the territory, commonly known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. It is <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s first official visit to <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> since June 1985, when the unelected, multiriacial government was installed to provide limited self-rule over the territory. In the ensuing three years, the so-called `` transitional government'' failed to win international recognition, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> continued to call for independence elections that would include the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has designated <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> the `` sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people,'' and most observers feel it would win a U.N.-supervised election. During the past three years, four of the six parties in the territorial government have grown increasingly adamant in demanding a total break from apartheid _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of separate political, social and educational structures for different racial groups. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Katjiuonga </PERSON>, chairman of the eight-man transitional <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Thursday he and possibly other members would quit the government if <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> rejected their proposal for a constitution stripped of all references to race and ethnic groups. He said that even if the independence question remained unsettled for years, Namibians could promote reconciliation and unity if they were allowed to implement the proposals for a bill of rights and non-racial elections for regional and local governments. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> must decide whether to bow at least partially to these demands or side with those who want to retain `` group rights'' _ the phrase used in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to justify racially segregated structures. Group rights in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> are backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Rehoboth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basters </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative mixed-race party, and by the all-white <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION>, an offshoot of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Namibian politicians say <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is mindful of how developments here would be viewed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where his government is trying to convince right-wing whites of its steadfast commitment to group rights. About 88 percent of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people are black, 6 percent white and 6 percent mixed-race. A major source of friction is that whites are by far the wealthiest group and are allowed to administer their own tax system to fund all-white schools and hospitals. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s chief representative in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, Administrator-General <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, said Thursday that the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government would be willing to negotiate major changes in the tax disbursement system and would accept for the first time the concept of regional, non-ethnic elections. But he indicated <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would insist on maintaining special protections for racial minorities. <PERSON> Katjiuonga </PERSON>, of the transitional <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> would lose some of its appeal if apartheid were eliminated and might be induced to join negotiations on a post-independence government. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I, defying <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> calls for independence. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> says his government will not consider the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> proposals as long as <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops remain in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> aiding the Marxist government against South African-backed rebels.

 A bomb that witnesses said may have been placed in a parked car by a passing motorist exploded Thursday, killing a man and scattering debris over a two-block area, police said. The car was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, said Lt. F.D. <PERSON> Tacker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The victim was trapped inside. The bomb exploded shortly before 2:30 p.m., shooting flames high into the air and scattering parts of the car over about a one-block area. `` It's charred black, the roof is gone and all the doors are blown open on it and there are no tires on it _ they've all burned off,'' said Fire Department spokesman R.C. Knight. The identity of the victim was not immediately known. `` A couple of witnesses said another car pulled up and someone placed some type of bomb device in the car,'' said Homicide Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kratz </PERSON>. `` At this point, we do n't know what type of bomb it was. Obviously it was a pretty spectacular explosion.'' Witnesses said the victim had parked his car and walked across the street to a barbecue stand, before returning to the vehicle. `` One of the medical officers told one of our people that the guy had gotten out of his car to get a glass of iced tea and when he got back in it exploded,'' said Fire Marshal <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>. Investigators were trying to gather pieces of the bomb, <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> said. The car was rented on Feb. 25, <PERSON> Kratz </PERSON> said. Investigators know the name of the person who rented the car but have not been able to determine whether he was the victim because at least three people had driven the car, <PERSON> Kratz </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> agreed on Thursday to try to resume extraditing Colombian drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. Extraditions were suspended last year after <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s supreme court, ruling on a technicality, said a 1979 extradition treaty was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s minister of justice, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutra </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at the military terminal at <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> international airport Thursday before he and Lawn left for <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and Lawn have also visited the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and will travel to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> as part of a review of what <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries are doing to stop drug smuggling into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Extraditions are a key element of the fight against drug smuggling, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> president agreed that both countries must work to overcome the legal problems blocking further extraditions, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said at the news conference. In response to questions, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> rejected the idea of an international police force to fight drugs, the suggestion that drugs should be legalized and the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops being sent to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to fight drug traffickers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contributes $ 14 million a year to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for fighting drugs. Colombians, often criticized in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for not doing enough to fight cocaine trafficking, have pointed out that it is Colombians who are suffering the most deaths in the war on drugs. Drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an attorney general, several judges, two newspaper editors and scores of policemen and soldiers in the last four years. Drug traffickers have threatened to kill members of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> decreed provisionally that arrest orders be lifted for <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, a Colombian that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agents call the world's biggest cocaine trafficker. The <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> has not made its final decision on whether or not to seek <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s arrest. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is not charged with any crimes in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to extradite <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has not extradited any alleged drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since February 1987 because the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year ruled a 1979 extradition treaty invalid on a technicality. Later Thursday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. His plane was prevented from landing in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> due to heavy rain, but he detoured to <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION> where he was to spend the night before traveling to <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, the capital, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

 The skull of a prehistoric animal has been identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact, meat-eating dinosaur, scientists announced Thursday. The skull was misidentified after its discovery in 1942 in eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> by an expedition from the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. It was in storage in the museum's basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year The museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of the Tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs, a ferocious meat-eating animal that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago. Because of its relatively small size, the new dinosaur has been named <PERSON> Nanotyrannus </PERSON> or `` pygmy tyrant'' by the scientists who identified it. The <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> skull is believed to be the only such specimen of the Nanotyrannus, although teeth have been found in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. `` This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, adjunct curator of paleontology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> grew suspicious of the skull's initial identification as a Gorgosaurus, a primitive and very common meat-eater, during a visit to the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> museum last spring. He worked with two other scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was disclosed in a paleontology publication this month. The Nanotyrannus resembled the giant Tyrannosaurus rex but was only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy, the scientists said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the Nanotyrannus probably weighed less than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> compared the skull, which is about 22 inches long and 10 inches high, to the size of a brown bear's head. He said the Nanotyrannus had the same level of advancement in anatomical features as the Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets that faced forward instead of sideways, a wider skull base and a neck joint that bent downwards. The Nanotyrannus head was discovered during a museum field trip to a farm in <LOCATION> Carter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The expedition yielded other dinosaur skeletons in the museum's collection but no other parts of the Nanotyrannus. `` It's very rare to find just the head, very rare. And I hope the rest of it is out there,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said after a news conference to announce the discovery. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the museum, said there are no plans to excavate the site again. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> blamed the 40-year misidentification on a lack of scientists. `` There are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs, or crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter you're talking about,'' he said. The third scientist involved in the discovery with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, assistant direector of the <ORGANIZATION> Tyrrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paleontology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> is n't dead, and he obviously is n't famous. But that did n't stop the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> author from putting his unpublished manuscripts up for sale Thursday, entering a market that usually belongs to the prominent or the deceased. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> was not expecting to pull in the $ 605,000 that <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s love letters brought at auction _ in fact, bidding on his works began at $ 2.75. Instead, he was hopeful of attracting a publisher for his latest novel, `` Run Red Riding Hood Run.'' So after 10 models in hooded sweatshirts simultaneously read excerpts from his book to about 50 people in the penthouse of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> watched as his literary properties, including two other unpublished novels, were sold for a total of $ 965. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> even auctioned off his collection of 30 rejection notices from publishers for $ 65. Also on the block were his dog-eared dictionary, which went for $ 40, various photos and letters, and cassette tapes of his dictated notes. `` I'm thrilled,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said after the sale. `` We did good.'' `` I read PR releases before I read comic books,'' said <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, 34, who freely admits the auction was nothing more than a Barnumesque stunt aimed at getting him attention. `` Run Red Riding Hood Run'' has a little bit of everything: `` There's murder, there's suspense, there's black comedy,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. But, as was the case with his books on the second <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON> trial and on his experiences at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, there's no publisher. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> says his publicity efforts have cost him about $ 15,000 _ `` and it could get worse.''

 The Pulitzer Prize board will look into a complaint that an award was granted for reporting that broke no new ground, but there is no such requirement for winners, the board secretary said Thursday. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> magazine, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, asserted that <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer reporter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s reporting on a secret Pentagon budget was built on an earlier story in the Journal by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> and broke no new ground. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting last week. The description of the prize does not require that the winner break new ground, board secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said. The reporter must only represent `` a distinguished example of reporting on national affairs,'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s magazine publisher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> on Thursday also criticized the award, noting that one of <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s stories was accompanied by an annotated document similar to a feature <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> did for the January 1987 issue of <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s `` Certainly, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> did a lot of work and a lot of very brilliant work on this story,'' said <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, who called The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to make his complaint. `` It does n't seem quite right that the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> gets a Pulitzer Prize unless originality has nothing to do with prize giving these days,'' he said. He said he did not plan to write the Pulitzer board, although he endorsed the Journal's complaint. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said that only he and the board chairman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, had seen the complaint. <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, a 5,000-circulation weekly, did not respond immediately to a telephoned request for comment. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said board members would discuss the complaint once they had read it, probably next week. The Inquirer's deputy managing editor, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, maintained that `` The series and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>'s work generally has broken new ground, whatever that means.'' `` I know it had a reaction,'' <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> said. `` I know it caused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to re-examine the situation and to ask for more information from the Pentagon. I guess I would call that breaking ground.'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said he interviewed more than 100 people around the country and was `` knee-deep in this before I saw <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s work.''

 Nine Soviet scientists head into the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert this weekend to set up their first U.S.-sanctioned equipment outside the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site to monitor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear explosions. The Soviet team will monitor two non-nuclear explosions that will be detonated within 100 miles of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> at the end of the month. `` While they've been to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> before, this is the first time they have had virtually unrestricted visas,'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> seismologist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Priestly </PERSON> said on Thursday. `` It's quite significant. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an American environmental group, and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> of the Earth under the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> are sponsoring the exchange of Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists in a cooperative effort they hope will spur a nuclear test ban treaty between the two powers. Verification of treaty compliance has been a sticking point during negotiations. `` Scientists know verification is possible, but for politicians and the average person, this seems quite complex,'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yukhnin </PERSON>, the head of the Soviet team, said at a news conference on Thursday less than an hour after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conducted its second announced nuclear test of the year at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. The first explosion the Soviets will monitor will take place in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> 90 miles northeast of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> on April 29 and will consist of 10 tons of chemical explosive. The following day, 15 tons of explosives will be detonated at <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, about 100 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. The explosions will be monitored at seismic stations set up around the Test Site, 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and at a temporary one that will be established next week near <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about midway between <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The equipment will test the stations' capability of monitoring even the smallest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests. While the Soviet government plays a role in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is a private, non-profit effort. This is the first time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has approved visas for Soviet scientists working with the unofficial council experiments. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists, including Priestly, were allowed to join their Soviet counterparts in monitoring three explosions starting in September 1986 near the Soviet test site.

 Presidents <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> signed accords on Thursday aimed at further propelling their nations, the largest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, toward becoming a joint economic force. They said their venture also ends speculation of a Latin `` nuclear race.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on a three-day visit, and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> signed three agreements eliminating tariffs on cars, automotive parts and more than 130 food products. The two neighbors began work in 1985 on a wide-ranging plan to unify their economies and create a South American Common Market. Their project has been slowed by their struggling economies and huge foreign debts, but progress has been evident. With the signing of nearly 25 agreements in all, trade between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> jumped from $ 900 million in 1985 to $ 1.5 billion in 1987. In addition, hundreds of students and professionals from both countries now exchange information and work together at long-term joint projects in aviation, transportation, scientific technology and agriculture. For years, Spanish-speaking <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, with a population exceeding 31 million, and Portuguese-speaking <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, with more than 143 million people, were archrivals. They put aside differences to become stronger economically. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> in 1985 became <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader after 21 years of military rule. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> became president of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in December 1983, the nation's first elected civilian leader following nearly eight years of military juntas. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said Thursday, `` We are taking new steps in the fruitful and promising path of integration. We are widening our capability to compete in the world. We have never had such an excellent relationship.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> arrived in the capital city of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> on Wednesday. It is the seventh time in three years the two presidents have met. During this trip, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> was also officially incorporated in the economic integration after a quick trip by President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>. He met with the other two presidents Wednesday. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> has taken part in most of the talks between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and it was expected to join the economic group, especially since the three countries share a border. The nuclear issue has been a touchy subject in the integration effort. Both <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in the past two years were reported to have developed the technology to enrich uranium, a key step in building a bomb. But both countries say their nuclear programs are for peaceful ends. On Friday, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> will take <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s nuclear experiment center of <LOCATION> Aramar </LOCATION>, outside of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> in the southeast. Last year, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s nuclear installations. `` We are ending any suspicions that nuclear development in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is not linked to peaceful purposes,'' said <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. Added <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, `` A year ago it was hard to imagine that a <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> president would visit a nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.'' Foreign Ministry officials said details were worked out during this visit for a future nuclear accord.

<HEAD>Officer Who Waited for Key to Apartment at Scene of Rape Is
Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A veteran police officer was dismissed Thursday after a city board found he broke department rules by waiting nearly 30 minutes for a key while a 12-year-old girl was being raped inside an apartment. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> was charged with breaking 10 department rules stemming from the Dec. 21 incident. The Police and Fire Commission found him in violation of five rules, but dismissed the most serious charge, failing to request assistance at the scene. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> said he expected to be cleared of wrongdoing and reinstated after an appeal. `` I still think I did the right thing,'' he said. `` No one got killed.'' The disciplinary hearings were begun shortly after the Dec. 20 incident, in which <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> and two other officers responded to a call of home invasion. They waited outside almost 30 minutes with the girl's frantic mother for the landlord to bring a key, rather than breaking in to rescue the girl. A supervisor told him to push the apartment door in if necessary, <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> testified, but he did not interpret that as an order. He maintained that he did not break into the apartment upon arriving because he feared the assailant might harm the girl and her 10-year-old brother. Four officers later broke down the door and arrested the assailant, police said. The two officers who accompanied <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> also have been scheduled for disciplinary hearings. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrrell </PERSON>, said immediately after the decision was announced that he would seek an administrative review of the decision from the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit courts. A two-thirds majority was required on each violation. Board member <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eveland </PERSON> found <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> in violation of eight of the 10 rules cited; Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, five; board member <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, one. The five violations were conduct unbecoming to an officer, unsatisfactory performance, improper filing of a report, abuse of command and violating departmental rules. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and 14-year veteran of the force, remained on active duty during the weeks-long hearing. <PERSON> Tyrrell </PERSON> said he would ask the courts for reinstatement to the force and any pay lost due to any suspension or dismissal.

 A van in which three boys apparently were trying to drive to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> crashed into a guardrail on an interstate highway with a 9-year-old at the wheel as police gave chase, authorities said. The boy was critically injured, and his 14-year-old brother and a 13-year-old friend, all from suburban <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, also were hurt in the accident about 5 a.m. just outside <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> received a call that a van was being driven erratically on the southbound lanes of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>, just across the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> line.

<HEAD>Italian Women Demand Right to Walk Alone in Safety at Night</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 30-year-old woman who was seized and raped by three young men in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s historic center has become a rallying point for <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> women seeking to be able to walk the streets alone at night in safety. M.C., as the Italian press identifies her, has unwittingly galvanized a campaign for tougher laws against sexual assault and challenged the age-old taboo in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that women should n't be out alone after dark. `` <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> is splendid by day, but by night for any woman who ventures into the street, it's only dark and dangerous,'' said <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagostena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassi </PERSON>, a leading attorney for women's causes who helped represent M.C. In 1986, 1,149 rapes were reported to police in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, according to the latest government statistics, but women's groups say many more cases go unreported. None has attracted more public attention than the ordeal of M.C., whose rape March 6 in the heart of the capital and the trial of her three attackers has been front-page news in Italian newspapers and subject of an editorial in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s daily newspaper. On March 26, two days after her attackers were convicted and each sentenced to prison for four years and eight months, more than 100,000 people marched through central <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in a demonstration for women's rights. M.C. appeared on the podium at the end of the rally, the biggest women's demonstration in the capital since the pro-abortion marches at the end of the 1970s. `` We want a society without violence,'' <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Passalacqua </PERSON>, one of the rally organizers, said as women of all ages from all parts of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, ranging from olive pickers from <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> to computer programmers in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, marched past. `` We're in a very grave situation now,'' she added. `` No woman can walk the streets alone at night without fear of being raped. But today we are saying she should be able to.'' According to police and court testimony, M.C. was assaulted by three men near <LOCATION> Piazza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navona </LOCATION>, one of central <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s most popular squares, as she walked home at about 1 a.m. after dinner with friends. The three, all in their early 20s, were arrested by a policeman who happened on the scene. The policeman testified that he found the three men lined up with their pants down in front of the woman, who he said was half-naked on the ground, her face bloodied, in a dark corner. `` Aw c'mon, you do n't want to arrest us for something like this?'' one of the men was quoted by Italian media as telling the policeman. M.C. was taken to a hospital, where she was reported as telling authorities: `` Yes, they were raping me. Two boys were holding me by the arms and another was trying to do something with me.'' The woman, with short dark hair and eyes covered by dark sunglasses, testified in the trial that she could not remember exactly what happened after the men approached her. The defendants, who were described by their families as good, law-abiding `` boys,'' gave conflicting testimony. One admitted to having sex with the woman, but all claimed that she had initiated the encounter. The packed courtroom burst into chaos when a defense lawyer, <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Addamiano </PERSON>, said in closing arguments that M.C. decided to accuse the three of rape `` rather than admit that she was willingly performing obscene acts in a public place.'' The judge, <PERSON> Antonino </PERSON> <PERSON> Stipo </PERSON>, ordered police to clear the courtroom as feminists and the defendants' relatives screamed at each other and at the lawyers. Hours later, the judge announced the three were guilty of rape, performing obscene acts in public and causing injury. Their lawyers have appealed. `` This trial was emblematic,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bassi </PERSON>, one of M.C.'s lawyers, said in an interview. `` It's one of so many cases. But I'm happy with the attention the trial received In a way, it's women re-claiming their rights to go out alone and do what they want.'' The notion that women should n't be out on the street alone at night was raised by the defendants' parents. `` What was that woman doing at 1:30 in the morning walking around alone?'' <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Putti </PERSON>, father of one of the three men, told Italian newspapers. `` A respectable person is at home at that hour. What was she looking for?'' When a reporter asked why his son was out so late, the father responded, `` They're boys. A pizza with friends, then they go around to have fun.'' An editorial in the <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> newspaper, criticized the parents for expressing `` wonder that a woman should walk around alone at that hour, rather than being upset and expressing pain for the crime committed by their sons.'' A decade ago the country was shocked by a television documentary of a rape trial in <LOCATION> Latina </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Defense lawyers suggested the victim, who was brutally raped by four men, had `` asked for it.'' The defendants were convicted, but given sentences of less than a year and granted conditional releases. The program helped spur a campaign for tougher anti-rape laws, but rape is still considered a `` crime against morals,'' punishable by up to 10 years in prison. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel recently began debate on proposed bills to make rape a `` crime against the person,'' stiffen sentences, allow for summary trials and permit women's groups to be plaintiffs in rape cases.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent its soldiers to this small island nation with a declaration of noble intentions: to end a murderous ethnic war, supervise a peace accord, then get out. That was eight months ago. The killings have not stopped, the biggest Tamil rebel group quickly reneged on the Indian-arranged peace accord and the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force of 3,000 soldiers has swelled to more than 50,000. Tamil rebels, seeking autonomy or independence for their ethnic minority on the island once known as <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>, are still massacring civilians from the Sinhalese majority and recently started turning their guns, axes and arson torches on the previously unthreatened Moslem minority. In addition, as direct or indirect results of the accord, Tamils are killing fellow Tamils, Sinhalese are killing fellow Sinhalese, and some young Moslems are taking up arms against Tamils. `` There appears to be a strange paradox here: the intensity of the violence being directly proportional to the increase in the number of Indian troops,'' the independent newspaper The Island said in a recent editorial. `` It is time that every citizen of this country told the Indians that if they can not do their jobs fast enough they got to get out and leave our problems to us.'' But defenders of the peace accord say it still offers the best, if not the only, hope for ending ethnic mayhem on a beautiful island that was building a booming tourist industry until 1983. That was the year militant Tamils, chafing under economic and political domination by the Sinhalese, exploded their cause into a guerrilla war that has now claimed more than 8,000 lives. `` We could n't have done anything different,'' said <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s minister of land development and a key negotiator of the accord. For the first time, he said, the accord specifically and publicly provided `` a solid understanding'' that the Sinhalese-dominated government would share power with the Tamils, a concept that he said was `` just an abstraction in the past.'' The accord guarantees some autonomy to the Tamils, provided the rebels surrender their arms. However, the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, fear the accord makes too many concessions to the Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the population. An underground organization of ultranationalist Sinhalese has assassinated at least 150 people who supported the accord or were prominent members of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The largest Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, are engaged in internecine warfare with smaller Tamil guerrilla groups that support the peace accord. Moslems, who comprise about 7 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s population, became targets of Tamil rebels trying to dominate the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, where the population is about equally divided among Tamils, Sinhalese and Moslems. Both the Tamils and the Sinhalese are descendents of people who migrated from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> centuries ago, but most Tamils are Hindus, most Sinhalese are Buddhists, and they speak different languages. The Moslems trace their religion and ancestry to Arab seafarers. Apart from the continuing violence, there is also a feeling that time is running out to enforce the peace accord. Under <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s constitution, the 82-year-old <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> has just 10 months left in office and can not run again, unless he pushes through an amendment or a new interpretation of his tenure. `` He, President <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, is about the only man who can put an end to the situation,'' said National Security Minister <PERSON> Lalith </PERSON> <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s own Cabinet is divided over the implementation of the accord and the Indian military presence. Although the ministers' public remarks tend to be fairly circumspect, their views are well-known _ and can be measured by the bodyguards around them.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After quarrels with the tax collector, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s favorite theatrical sons have come home. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> is back on the Swedish stage after a 14-year absence. Director <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, who lived in self-imposed exile for several years, also is rehearsing a new play. Both <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, whose brooding, introspective films in the 1950s and'60s gave Swedish film an international reputation, and <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s most durable actor, left the country because of tax problems. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> but comes back every year for summer vacation, never thought of himself as an expatriate and has returned twice to make films. `` I'm still totally Swedish,'' he said. `` I still have my roots here.'' Swedish taxes, among the highest in the world, are driving young artists away, he said in an interview. The average Swede pays half his salary in taxes, and marginal tax on top incomes can run as high as 78 percent. `` A lot of talent is not used in this country because of this. If you do n't get anything financially out of it, why work here?'' said <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, 58. Among his 40 foreign film roles are the Jesuit priest in `` The Exorcist,'' the assassin in `` Three Days of the Condor,'' and the artist @ husband in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Hannah and Her Sisters.'' He launched his career abroad in 1965 as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in `` The Greatest Story Ever Told.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in a huff in 1973 after paying what he said was an unfairly large tax bill. He was assessed $ 20,050 for allegedly underpaying his taxes. His lawyers took the case to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, claiming that the lack of an appeal mechanism against the tax authorities was an infringement of his rights. Last year, the Swedish government settled out of court, repaying him $ 33,333 compensation and $ 20,000 for costs. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> said he is trying to put the tax affair behind him without bitterness. `` I'm trying not to be poisoned by paranoia,'' he said. `` Today I feel freer than when I left, because this problem is solved and because I know that if I want to I could work abroad all the time.'' His ties to his country are stronger than others have shown. Once Hollywood made stars of <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, they were gone from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for good. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> is playing at the Royal Dramatic Theater, where he began his acting career 40 years ago and where he met <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, with whom he did 11 films. He said one reason for returning to the stage was fascination with the character he was offered in `` Master Olof,'' an 1871 drama by <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Strindberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s greatest literary figure. He plays a roguish revolutionary during the 16th-century Swedish Reformation. It's a supporting role, but <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> said he does n't care `` It's the best part in the play,'' he said. He said he also was drawn by the double anniversary of the royal theater's 200th year and the 80th year since it moved to its gilded waterfront building, now a city landmark. Working in the Swedish language again `` is wonderful, it's exciting,'' he said `` It's still very difficult for me to act in English, and it always will be. ... It takes a longer time to really make the lines your own.'' Last year <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, who does three projects a year, finished `` Pelle the Conqueror,'' his first Swedish-language film in five years. The title role of <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON>, a peasant farmhand, could have been tailored for the tall, blond Swede with a farmer's weatherbeaten look and huge hands. The role won him the prestigious Swedish Golden Bug Award as best actor in 1987 and two Danish acting prizes, one by critics and one by the film academy. The film will be entered in the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's such a rich character,'' he said. `` He is so vulnerable and so miserable; he is full of expectations, he is terribly disappointed, he is very happy, he is furious. ... It's probably the best part I've ever had.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> also is directing his first movie, a Danish-language film called `` Along the Roadside.'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, 69, is directing his fifth play since returning from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he lived for about five years until he came back in 1982 to film the acclaimed `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>.'' In 1976, tax inspectors barged into a rehearsal and took the famed director away for questioning on suspicion of tax evasion. He was cleared of all charges, but he wrote in his 1987 autobiography that the incident drove him into a depression that turned to rage against his country. At the same time, he was uncomfortable away from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` I felt like an invalid who had lost an arm and a leg,'' he wrote in his autobiography, `` Magic Lantern.'' `` I longed for the old language, the friends and the companionship.'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s staging of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' reunites him with <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> whom he discovered in a soap advertisement in 1952 and launched as an international actress. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, 53, left acting for several years to work in peace causes, but came back to the stage in 1986.

<HEAD>Art Island Is Cultural Oasis in West Germany's Industry Belt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLZHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most talked about new art museums is a pastoral island that boasts Rembrandts, Roman ruins and a resident sculptor who fires cannon salutes to Mother Nature. <LOCATION> Hombroich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is a quiet cultural oasis in the heart of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most heavily industrialized area. `` Art and nature come together at Hombroich,'' says <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a wealthy businessman who owns the <LOCATION> Erft </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, about nine miles west of <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>. `` Hombroich is timeless. It does n't really have a purpose because it is not static. Nature constantly changes, as will the collection,'' says <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a 51-year-old university dropout and admirer of Eastern philosophy. Hombroich is the home of <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s private collection of Rembrandt etchings, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> watercolors, sculptures by <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brancusi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacometti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Corinth </PERSON> portraits, African masks, ancient Cambodian idols and prehistoric pottery. The island has also been the site of open-air concerts by such world-famous classical musicians as violinist <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zukerman </PERSON> and pianist <PERSON> Svyatoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s property is also an archaelogical treasure. Experts say the ruins of two Roman villas lie beneath the soil, and there is also evidence of one of the earliest Stone Age settlements in nNorthern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The exhibition buildings are reached by labyrinthine paths that lead visitors past shrubs and trees transplanted from such far-away places as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hombroich </PERSON>'s resident waterfowl float near a foot bridge spanning the river. Ruminating on the links between art and nature is a favored preoccupation of <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, and has led him to adopt some unconventional art principles. He rejects the conventional practice of installing climate-control systems as a means of preserving his valuable collection. `` The pictures must have a chance to have their own lives, just like us humans,'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` What would be better for a human being _ to live in an air-conditioned room for 1,000 years, or to live normally? Besides, paintings can live hundreds of years without climate control.'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> also shuns the normal museum practice of hanging plaques near artworks to identify their creator and titles. He says signs would be a distraction. Like <PERSON> Hombroich </PERSON>'s lush vegetation, works of art also sprout, grow and bloom on <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>'s 42 acres of <LOCATION> Erft </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> property. Sculptor <PERSON> Anatol </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzfeld </PERSON> works nearly every day inside a shed on the banks of the Erft, producing wooden and metal objects that are scattered about the island and blend with the landscape. He periodically fires grass and flower seeds from his hand-built, scrap-metal cannon in what he calls a symbolic salute to nature. Since the island first opened in May 1987, tens of thousands of people have visited, including artists, musicians and intellectuals who <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> says are enchanted as much by the serene setting as by the art collection. Visitors pay about $ 9 to visit the island, but <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> says profit is not his primary motive. A speculator in industrial real estate, he purchased the <LOCATION> Erft </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> property in 1982 as a home for his expanding art collection. He chose <LOCATION> Hombroich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after a long search. `` You look for years for the right property to do something special, and suddenly you find it. It was the law of chance,'' says <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, who refuses to say how much the property cost. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> hired noted German sculptor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerich </PERSON> to design <PERSON> Hombroich </PERSON>'s cubist art pavilions. <PERSON> Gotthard </PERSON> <PERSON> Graubner </PERSON>, a prominent West German painter whose work is also among the Hombroich collection, advises <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> on his art purchases. Another important partner for <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Korte </PERSON>, a landscape gardener who helped transform <PERSON> Hombroich </PERSON> from a jungle of wild undergrowth. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> went into business for himself in 1958, after quitting university because `` formal studying makes me nervous.'' `` I started out with zero money,'' he says. `` It took 10 years until I was able to buy my first art piece. I bought what I liked. You buy and buy and buy, and suddenly you have a lot of paintings.'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> says his purchase of <LOCATION> Hombroich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> means that his art collection will be evolving in new directions which he himself ca n't yet imagine. `` At first I had a collection. It grew. Now I have an island, where everything has its own importance _ the collection, nature and the buildings,'' he says. `` You do your work, and it changes with what you feel is right.''

<TEXT>
 Director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with an intelligence report for other Americans who plan to stage plays in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>: Do n't underestimate the audience. `` The audience is much maligned by many of the theater artists because they feel the audience is uncritical, is too pleased by too many things,'' said <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're pleased by bad theater, by mediocre theater, by good theater, by brilliant theater. They'll go to all of it,'' he said. Last month, <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> became the first American to direct an American play in the land of glasnost. In staging his production of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Desire Under the Elms'' at the 1,000-seat <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he also learned other lessons about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s actors, theater technicians, designers, directors and playwrights. They may help three other American theater artists planning trips to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of the McCarter Theatre in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnuff </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> LaJolla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playhouse </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of Trinity Repretory in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` I ca n't tell you what it was like to have a 24-hour difference between watching my play in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> the night before I left, and being here for the second preview of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s play,'' said <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, who recently opened <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s `` Principia Scriptoriae'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The difference was that there, you felt a sort of unified leaning forward and hunger for this,'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> said. `` Here, you look around the comfortable theater setting. ... People are listening, yes, but there are some empty seats at the preview, legs are crossed, arms are folded, people are waiting to be grabbed.'' But why, <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> wondered, should n't American audiences wait to be grabbed in what he referred to as `` the grabbiest place in the world' _ with thousands of stimulants `` from the 32-cable channels, to the video thing they can rent, to just life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Those stimulants are hard to find in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where audiences come `` eager to hear what's going on in the world, eager to be moved or eager to be preached to _ frankly, politically.'' The one play he saw in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that was n't overtly political was his production of `` Desire Under the Elms,'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> said. `` Everything on their stage is political now in a very open and very critical way, but it still seems like it's 20 years old.'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> described himself as a `` collaborative director'' who wants to hear the views of actors, designers, lighting directors and sound engineers. `` I rely on the people I work with,'' he said. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> had good working relations with Soviet designers, costumers and other behind the scenes people. `` They, I thought, were real artists,'' he said. However, it was impossible to have the same collaborative effort with Soviet actors, he said, because they have not yet developed a sense of mutual trust. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> company needs massive restructuring and its artistic director, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON>, is working toward that goal. `` However, the socialist idea of tenure for the artists has crippled the Soviet theater for the most part,'' he said. `` It is carrying a lot of baggage ... they would like to lose.'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> said he was asked by many in Soviet theater how the American theater is structured: `` How we structure work, how we treat the actors, how we pay the playwrights, how we pay directors. `` They are intrigued by the idea that Americans can pull together an ensemble company in five weeks of rehearsal, and not two years of rehearsal for a company of 15 while the other 75 members of the company are stil getting a weekly salary while you're rehearsing and they're sitting home,'' he said. `` I think my way of working was as much a mystery to them as their way of working was as interesting to me.''

 <PERSON> Miep </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>, the woman who helped hide the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> family from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, says it was a long time before she could bring herself to read `` The Diary of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>,'' even though it was she who saved it. `` Mr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> always said to me, ` Miep, read it, read it,' and I said, ` No, I ca n't,' because I was in fear of what I'd read,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> in halting English. `` But after the second edition, I finally read it, but only when I'm alone. `` Then there grow up something. It was -LRB- as -RRB- if <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> come into me. I heard her cry. She was with me. She was here, in here,'' she said, touching her heart, her eyes welling up with tears. `` For I'm so very, very happy. Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> is the author of her own book, `` <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Remembered </PERSON>,'' written with <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>. It is the basis of the TV movie `` The Attic: The Hiding of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>,'' airing next Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. In a tender scene in the movie, young <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> suggests to <PERSON> Miep </PERSON> that marriage will keep her from being deported to her native <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from German-occupied <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. `` All we need do is find a handsome, intelligent, charming gentleman of Dutch birth, sound of mind and body, financially solvent with a fairly promising future in his chosen profession, offering you comfort and security in your twilight years,'' says <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Huub </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapel </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>, 79, was joined by her 82-year-old husband at a recent news conference. They agreed that the scene, as well as the rest of the movie, was quite accurate. They were joined by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON>, who portrays Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>. The movie also stars <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> in a rare television appearance playing <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>, an employee of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, helped hide his family and four other people in the attic above their offices for more than two years, until the group was discovered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> died in a concentration camp, but her father survived and later published the diary <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> kept while in hiding. It became one of the most powerful anti-war statements ever written. It was Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> who preserved <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s diary and gave it to <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> after the war. Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> said she never had any desire to write a book, because she felt nothing could be more eloquent than the diary. But she was convinced by Gold that a history should be written of what it was like in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> outside the attic during that time. `` You must understand,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> said, `` it was very painful for us, but after many difficult _ we gave her the information for that reason.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> plays the bright, mischievous <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, for whom imprisonment in the attic was especially difficult. Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> fondly recalled <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> as a `` very charming child, lively, but very curious.'' `` She always ask us and ask us what happen outside. ... After a while my husband tell me, you must not tell her all the terrible things, because it is terrible enough to be in hiding. But she always ask in a different way until she get the answer she want, and I lost.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' portrayal _ `` She did it very good.'' <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON>, she said, played her `` the way I looked to myself: No panic in a difficult situation. She was right. She was me.'' The movie is from director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Erman </PERSON> and screenwriter <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, who teamed on one of the best TV movies of last season, `` When the Time Comes.'' <PERSON> Erman </PERSON> also directed `` Who Will Love My Children?'' and `` An Early Frost.'' <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>'s credits include the screenplay `` Something About Amelia.'' Rather than focusing on life in the attic, the movie portrays the courage of Dutch citizens who defied the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> insisted there was nothing especially heroic about what she did. `` We only did our human duty _ help people who need help. But there were heroes,'' she said, `` the eight people in hiding. `` I can say out of my heart I am so happy that I could give the diary to Mr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, and Mr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> could give the diary to the world.

<HEAD>Venetians Abandon City to Tourists and the Rich</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the world's most enchanting cities was founded 15 centuries ago by frightened citizens who sought refuge among its 118 islets in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> from the southward invasion of <LOCATION> Lombards </LOCATION>. Now their 20th-century descendents are fleeing in the other direction, heading back north to the Italian mainland and abandoning their lagoon city in the northern <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to hordes of tourists and real estate speculators. <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> has become too expensive for its natives and those still left say it is losing its soul. As Venetians flee, the city is trying desperately to save itself from high tides, floods, polluted canals, erosion and decay. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars provided by special national legislation, planners have come up with plans _ after 20 years of striving _ for movable dikes and sophisticated sewers to stop the lagoon's green-black waters from doing further damage. The initiative to do something took root after a disastrous flood in 1966 and the cry of `` Save Venice'' went up. Art lovers from around the world pitched in to rescue palaces, churches and paintings from the annual high tides. But no one came up with a `` save the Venetians'' campaign and most descendents of one of the world's most glorious republics do n't live in palaces on the Grand Canal. They can put up with stench from garbage and refuse in the canals, which also serve as sewers, and the winter floods _ even the summer floods of tourists. It is the lack of affordable housing that's forcing <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s proud, sea-loving natives to the Italian mainland Alarmed by the loss of regular customers, the city's bakers organized a conference this winter to discuss the exodus. A report prepared by a provincial agency informed the bakers that in 1951 <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> had 175,000 people, the most ever in modern times. Last year, the number was down to 83,000 and about one-fifth of those are older than 60. The report predicted by the year 2015 <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> could have only 20,000 permanent residents. `` If we go ahead at this rate, they'll be zero,'' said <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanon </PERSON>, a Venetian who wrote the report. Butcher shops, grocery stores, carpenters and plumbers have been closing along the city's narrow, zigzagging streets. Popping up everywhere _ sometimes four, five or six to a street _ are shops selling nothing but <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> masks _ in gold, ceramic, wood, face-sized and pocket-sized _ as souvenirs of the <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> Gras festivities that pack the city with outsiders every winter. The mask shops have become a symbol for Venetians who say the loss of the city's natives is robbing <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> of something just as precious as its classic paintings and its mosaic-studded Byzantine basilica ceilings. `` <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s soul is emptying out. It's becoming a <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>, a spiritually poor one,'' said <PERSON> Gianluigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Casini </PERSON>, an architect who has helped restore canal-side palaces dating back to the 7th-century beginning of rule by the doges. `` When I was a boy, all the kids would be playing in the piazzas. Now there are few kids,'' said <PERSON> Casini </PERSON>, who at 34 is one of a dwindling number of young Venetians. `` Only old people stay, those who ca n't go away.

By law, apartments should rent for far less under the city's rent-control program But as elsewhere in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, landlords prefer to keep apartments vacant hoping for a foreigner or an Italian rich enough to pay illegal high rents. A nighttime ride down the Grand Canal turns up many darkened apartments. Some belong to foreigners or the rich who come from <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, 165 miles away, for vacations or weekends. Many other houses are in no shape to live in. Waters lapping at the front door and sea breezes drifting by the balcony may inspire poetry, but flooding and salty air constantly erode foundations and beams. Restoration, especially of historic buildings, is more costly in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, chiefly because supplies must come by barge or by porters who handle small loads on carts in carless <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>VENICE: carless Venice.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In the last few years, however, some young Venetians have taken advantage of government-subsidized mortgages to buy properties, and the city has bought many buildings to rent out. `` But the city ca n't buy all the houses,'' Mayor <PERSON> Casellati </PERSON> said. Not all Venetians are planning to leave. <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagliapietra </PERSON>, who runs a camera shop, said his teen-age daughter is looking forward to making money in the tourist business when she's old enough. Because of the exodus of Venetians, skilled laborers must be brought in from the mainland. `` To restore a house you have to sell a house'' is a Venetian byword. At the same time, the easy spending of tourists drives up prices for goods in stores. For example, natives complain that a pair of shoes that sell for 50,000 lire -LRB- $ 42 -RRB- in <LOCATION> Mestre </LOCATION> are twice that in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. Fruit and vegetables generally cost about 30 percent more in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> than in the pricier neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` It's the middle class that's going away,'' said <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Casellati </PERSON>. `` If someone comes back, it's the rich.'' Disappearing with the exodus is the Venice of old, when everybody knew everybody else, <PERSON> Casellati </PERSON> added. `` In the old days, a doge would live next to a poor person; <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s classes were all mixed together. All this is being lost.'' Even some of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s gondoliers live in <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zanon </PERSON>, who wrote the report on the declining population, said exodus that is siphoning off people has an ironic twist: it began because the city was too crowded. `` If the city had a plan, they could have done something,'' he said. `` But they did n't do anything.'' After the 1966 flood, tourism took off, perhaps inspired by the worry that <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> some day might be swamped for good by the tides. By the 1970s, real estate speculators started to move in, betting that the tourism boom would last. It became fashionable for big name companies, like <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>, to restore palaces for headquarters, banquets or exhibitions. `` We Venetians are at our limits to transmit culture; we are outnumbered by tourists,'' <PERSON> Zanon </PERSON> said. `` My daughter does n't even speak Venetian,'' a dialect more lilting than a gondolier's song. `` The sadness about <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>,'' he added, `` is not the pollution'' _ or decay. `` It's the politicians who do n't do anything.'' The mayor said he'd like to see a law that would force real-estate buyers to live in what they bought or rent their properties for several years only to Venetians. But he acknowledges that might be impossible in a free-market society. In the last few years, however, some young Venetians have taken advantage of government-subsidized mortgages to buy properties, and the city has bought many buildings to rent out. `` But the city ca n't buy all the houses,'' Mayor <PERSON> Casellati </PERSON> said. Not all Venetians are planning to leave. <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagliapietra </PERSON>, who runs a camera shop, said his teen-age daughter is looking forward to making money in the tourist business when she's old enough.

 Consumers who have pinched pennies in recent months loosened their purse strings in March, giving many of the nation's largest general retailers a strong month. But Wall Street analysts, noting that sales lagged at other stores, warned Thursday that shoppers may return to their more cautious ways. Storeowners and analysts attributed the better-than-expected results to the early Easter holiday, which gave consumers an incentive to get their spring shopping done.

<HEAD>Retailers Note Healthy March Sales, Stocks Climb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Many of the nation's major retailers have notched healthy sales gains in March, while the stock market wavered amid a mid-week advance. The early Easter holiday helped the March retail sales reported by major retailers, experts said Thursday. But although sales were strong for many, including F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with a 29 percent jump over March 1987, there were some exceptions. The nation's largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported its sales rose just 1.5 percent during the month. Analysts said the stores with lackluster sales suffered from general consumer caution. `` The shift in the Easter calendar should have helped in many cases to lift sales, but we're still in a very sluggish environment,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Consumers have spent cautiously since early last year, and analysts predict they will remain tight-fisted for at least the first part of 1988. In the financial markets on Thursday, stock prices managed to move higher in an erratic session and add to Wednesday's strong gain. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 64.16 points Wednesday, edged up 0.50 to 2,062.17. Over the past three days, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average has gained 81.47 points. New signs of stability in the dollar have boosted stock prices around the world. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market climbed Thursday to new highs, having recovered all the ground it lost in last year's crash. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market slipped. Prices of long-term government bonds declined slightly, pushing their yields up to the 8.75 percent range. Oil prices climbed steadily, piercing the $ 17-a-barrel level in advance of an important meeting this weekend of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

 Oil futures prices have edged back above the $ 17-a-barrel level in moderate trading, recouping losses recorded earlier in the week. Analysts and traders said the market appeared calm Thursday ahead of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee meeting scheduled to begin this weekend in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, even though there have been reports of trader nervousness. Contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 25 cents per barrel to $ 17.06. Among refined products, wholesale heating oil for May delivery rose 0.39 cent a gallon to 45.73 cents, and wholesale unleaded gasoline for May rose 0.40 cent a gallon to 48.82 cents. Longer-term contracts also rose. `` We had a very steady and constructive market that continued up all day,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, senior energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The fundamentals look good _ demand keeps edging up, and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is not overproducing,'' he said. Traders and analysts said the session's buyers included refiners who stepped up their purchases as prices inched above the $ 17-a-barrel level. `` They saw that the market was getting too high, too quickly, so they speeded up their purchases,'' noted <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, a large money management firm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> reportedly purchased 3,000 May contracts for crude, a move that was believed to have absorbed much of the selling in the market. The upcoming <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting has not stirred much nervousness among traders. Most believe the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' pricing committee will not take much constructive action at the April 9 meeting. Some market participants had hoped the 13-nation cartel would act aggressively to stabilize prices and enforce production limits to curb excessive supplies. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the group likely would only `` issue a bland statement.''

 A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> entrepreneur hopes a computerized sonar device is the answer for illuminating the rearward blind spots that plague drivers of bulky trucks and recreational vehicles. The blind-spot scanner, which will which cost $ 400 to $ 550 depending on the size of the vehicle using it, signals the driver when a vehicle slips into the `` black hole'' by the back wheels of a tractor-trailer or other big truck, out of sight of the rear-view mirror. Marketing the `` Vehicle Blind Spot Alert'' is <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, an insurance salesman whose work made him aware of a need for such a device. Many of his clients are truckers who repeatedly have told him of problems stemming from cars that move into their blind spot, one of the most common causes of accidents, said <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON>, 47. When a truck attempts to turn or change lanes with a car in the blind spot, the results can be fatal for those in the unseen vehicle and expensive for the trucker's insurer. The blind-spot detector employs sensors are attached to both sides of the vehicle and wired to a small computer on a metal box fitted below the dash. Two small red lights placed on top of the windshield indicate whether another vehicle is in the blind spot _ the left light blinks on when a car slips into the left blind spot, and vice-versa. The device also beeps when the turning signal is turned on and a vehicle is in the blind spot. `` It's made me a better driver,'' <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON> said of the demonstration model he's used in his van for several months. `` It's made me more alert that there are people around me. Motor carriers will be the first big target market for the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION> and headed by <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON>'s wife. He also hopes to sell the device to owners of cumbersome campers and to companies that rent moving trucks. With the patent application still pending, <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON> made his first sales at the end of March and put field representatives to work in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He plans to embark on a national sales effort by August, he says. The detector was developed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziembicki </PERSON> of Indian Valley Manufacturing of <LOCATION> Telfore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Ziembicki </PERSON> from a business contact, urged him to tackle the blind spot with some technology he was developing in work on an unrelated product <PERSON> Bartodziej </PERSON> says all test drivers who have tried it would rather drive with the detector than without it. And one insurance company he deals with has indicated an interest in offering lower rates for trucks equipped with the detector, he says. `` We do n't endorse any product, but we certainly endorse the concept,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bufton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bufton </PERSON> said her organization still recommends that drivers attempt to turn and look for cars that may be in their blind spot.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Mixed in March as Sluggish Spending Trend Continues</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An early Easter helped lure consumers into stores in March, giving many of the nation's largest general retailers a respite from their sluggish sales of the past year. But experts do n't believe shoppers are on a long-term spending spree. Retailers and analysts attributed the strong March sales increases at some stores to a quirk in the calendar: with Easter falling earlier in April than usual, consumers did their spring shopping in March. That made comparisons with March 1987 look better. `` They're not as good as they appear,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a retailing analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the March figures. Among the retailers reporting strong sales was F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which registered a 29 percent increase over March 1987 sales. At the other end of the spectrum, the nation's largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, reported its sales rose just 1.5 percent. The lackluster sales resulted from consumers' general caution, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The shift in the Easter calendar should have helped in many cases to lift sales, but we're still in a very sluggish environment,'' <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said. Consumers have spent cautiously since early last year, and analysts predict they will remain tight-fisted for at least the first part of 1988. The rate of spending is crucial to a retailer's bottom line, but economists watch it for signals of the nation's economic health. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product. Apparel retailers continued to have problems because of consumers' continuing disenchantment with the stores' latest lines, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sack </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> was among the stores having problems with their fashion lines, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said The retailer said its sales for the first nine weeks of the fiscal year rose 1.9 percent over the same period a year earlier. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 8.6 percent last month, and 5.5 percent so far this year. Its comparable store sales _ those from stores open at least a year _ rose 5.5 percent last month, and 2.6 percent for the year to date. Rapidly-expanding <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 36 percent in March and 34 percent so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s comparable store sales rose 15 percent last month and 14 percent for the first two months of fiscal 1988 <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 10.2 percent sales increase last month, and a 5.7 percent year-to-date gain Its comparable store sales were up 9.3 percent last month and 4.9 percent so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales were up 28.8 percent last month and 23.4 percent so far this year.

<HEAD>U.S.-Made Hondas Coming To Japan, Sign Of New Direction In Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of thriving on a booming export trade, it might seem odd for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. to celebrate the first arrival here of U.S.-built <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> automobiles But for the company and the domestic economy, today's celebration over the shipload of 540 Hondas built in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, marked more than a simple welcoming party For <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, the shipment signaled maturity for a company that in two decades has transformed itself from a respected motorcycle maker into a worldwide maker of attractive cars. In a broader sense, the imported Hondas reflected ongoing changes in the surprisingly robust Japanese economy, which is being fuled more by domestic demand than because of exports, its longstanding source of growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has surged back from last October's worldwide crash On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> surpassed its previous high, which was set on Oct. 14. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> exchange indexes are still about 10 percent below pre-crash levels. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s gross national product grew at a vibrant rate estimated at 7 percent to 8 percent in the last quarter of fiscal 1987-88, which ended March 31. Official figures are n't yet published. Most analysts expect it to expand at over 4 percent in the new fiscal year. The Japanese consumer _ the same Japanese whose propensity to save is legendary _ is changing. The car that <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> is importing is the Accord coupe, a type of car that has n't been much favored by Japanese buyers, who traditionally have gone for four-door family sedans. But in recent years, as the strong yen has greatly increased the wealth of some Japanese, sportier cars have been selling better, and the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Accord coupe is aimed at that increasing market. Still, why not make it in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> explained: `` This particular car, the coupe, is completely designed and set up by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D -LRB- research and development -RRB- and engineering. So we do n't have facilities in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to build it. It was built for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. We see the car as an American car.'' The company saw the growing demand in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and `` thought that it probably would sell,'' he said. The company predicts sales in 1988 of the American-made coupe at 4,000, and hopes sales will grow to 50,000 in 1991. The Japanese domestic car market is the second biggest in the world after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has an export quota of 2.3 million cars a year. Oddly, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> sells more cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about 740,000 last year, than in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, about 365,000. Importing the Accord coupe is part of the company's drive to increase its domestic market share. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price for the Accord coupe is about $ 15,000; its price in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has n't been announced. The Japanese economy has spurted ahead on a combination of the high yen and some pump-priming undertaken by the Japanese government last spring when it looked as if 1987 might be a recession year. On Thursday, the Japanese parliament enacted another mildly expansionary budget of 56.7 trillion yen -LRB- $ 453.6 billion -RRB-, up 4.8 percent from the earlier year. The new budget includes a big increase in public works spending, up 19.7 percent at 7.3 trillion yen -LRB- $ 58.4 billion -RRB-, to keep domestic demand high. A strong factor fueling growth last year was private-sector housing investment, which leaped 21.7 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> economists. They predicted in early April that the economy would expand at a 4.1 percent rate in fiscal 1988-89, inflation would be only 0.9 percent, and the dollar would average 122 yen, close to its recent level of 123-125 yen. A projection by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Okasan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> predicted 4.5 percent growth. The Okasan and <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> projections agreed that private housing would stall after its hot performance in the previous year, but that personal spending and corporate capital investment would continue to fuel growth. The Okasan think tank said domestic demand would push the economy up 5.6 percent while external demand _ exports _ would shrink and reduce the economy's growth by 1.1 percent. Okasan expected the trade surplus to drop from $ 93.3 billion in the past fiscal year to $ 87.7 billion, and the dollar to average 124 yen.

<HEAD>Lucky Stores Rejects Takeover Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has spurned <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s offer for a $ 1.74 billion buyout and says it may undergo a major restructuring or sell the company elsewhere. Lucky said Thursday its directors unanimously had rejected <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' unsolicited $ 45 a share tender offer as `` inadequate'' and not in the best interests of the company or its stockholders. The board also rebuffed the offer by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, a Salt Lake City-based grocery and drugstore chain, to increase its bid to $ 50 a share in a negotiated acquisition. In addition, Dublin-based Lucky adopted a stock purchase rights defense plan aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. The rejection of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' surprise tender offer for Lucky's 38.6 million outstanding shares came 17 months after <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> blocked a hostile takeover attempt by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. A combination of the two companies would create the nation's biggest supermarket chain <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> vice president for investor public relations, said his company had no comment on the announcement. Lucky's stock closed at $ 52.50 per share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, up $ 3.75 from Wednesday's close. In addition to rejecting <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' bid, Lucky's board also authorized company management and advisers to consider alternatives to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> buyout to boost its stock price. Alternatives could include a possible reorganization to focus on Lucky's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> operations, a leveraged recapitalization with possible distributions to stockholders by a dividend or share repurchase, and a negotiated sale of the company to a third party. `` We are confident that pursuit of one of these alternatives will provide our best opportunity to achieve greater value for our stockholders,'' stated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>, Lucky's chairman and chief executive officer. The board also adopted a warrant dividend plan and has declared a dividend under the plan of one common stock purchase right for each share of outstanding common stock, payable to stockholders of record on April 8. The plan would act to dilute Lucky's common stock in the event of a hostile takeover, making such a move prohibitively expensive. The company stated the plan was aimed at preventing unsolicited attempts to acquire a controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> through a tender offer or on the open market `` at prices determined by the board to be inadequate.'' A merger of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,700 outlets in 40 states, and Lucky would have make Lucky the nation's largest supermarket chain, surpassing No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Lucky has 480 outlets, 340 within the state <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> had indicated it would convert its struggling 240 Alpha Beta outlets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to Lucky stores. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> last year posted $ 14.3 billion in annual sales, while Lucky had $ 6.9 billion in sales.

<HEAD>Huge Supermarket Chain Reports Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it suffered a $ 487.7 million loss last year, largely due to interest expenses from its 1986 leveraged buyout and to income tax law changes. The privately-held supermarket chain, the nation's second-largest after Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had posted a $ 14.3 million loss in 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> also said its revenue fell to $ 18.3 billion last year from $ 20.3 billion the previous year. However, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>'s operating profit rose to $ 448.3 million from $ 422.9 million the previous year, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> said. Last year's loss was blamed on $ 576.4 million in interest expense, largely stemming from the leveraged buyout, and a $ 409.4 million bookkeeping charge resulting from the new tax law, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> believes its interest expenses have peaked and will decline over the next few years, said the company's controller, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Domeier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Domeier </PERSON> said the company trimmed its long-term debt by 32 percent to $ 3.1 billion in 1987 and is one to two years ahead of schedule in paying off its debt. The drop in revenue was attributed to the sale of several divisions, including the 105-store Liquor Barn chain and markets in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and four states, to raise capital and help pay off the debt. During the same period, sales for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores grew 5 percent, <PERSON> Domeier </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar traded lower against all major foreign currencies except the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> early today. Gold prices rose. Foreign currency dealers said the market is waiting for a meeting of finance ministers of the seven major industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week. Most said they expect the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ to reaffirm their wish to keep the dollar stable around its current levels. European traders said interest was likely to focus on the British pound again today, following intervention by the West German and British central banks Thursday to stop sterling's rise. `` Sterling is very healthy at the moment but that old fear of central bank intervention should keep the market from pushing it up too fast,'' said one trader with a major Italian commercial bank. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 125.18. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.35 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6810; 1.3825 Swiss francs, up from 1.3817; 5.6740 French francs, down from 5.7022; 1.8855 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8865; 1,241.20 Italian lire, down from 1,246.50; and 1.2475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2448 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8775 to buy one British pound today, more expensive for buyers than late Thursday's $ 1.867. Gold prices were higher in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> than late Thursday's $ 447.75 a troy ounce. The gold metal opened at a bid price of $ 449.40 an ounce but at midmorning today the city's five major bullion dealers had fixed a recommended price of $ 448.60. One dealer said that after hitting a low of about $ 445 Thursday, gold has found some support at its current levels. Other bullion dealers said attention will be focused on the dollar, and that a major move in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency could send gold moving. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 448.65, up from $ 448 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.06 to close at a bid $ 450.72. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.42 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $ 6.40.

 Stock prices eased slightly today from their record level of a day earlier, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar also dipped in trading against the Japanese yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 258.05-point winner Thursday, shed a modest 20.33 points, or 0.07 percent, finishing the week at 26,748.89. The Nikkei's close of 26,768.22 points Thursday was its highest ever. Its level today, though marginally lower, surpassed the previous best of 26,646.43 set the week before the worldwide stock market panic last October. `` The decline was caused by price adjusting. There were concerns that the market was rising too fast,'' said <PERSON> Hiromi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoneyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The weaker dollar also helped promote selling, he said. Activity faded in the afternoon after a busy morning session during in prices rose on momentum carried over from Thursday's sharp rally, traders said The market's main barometer briefly touched a high of 26,926.41 during morning trading on an estimated volume of 1 billion shares _ twice the afternoon session's volume. Share prices were mixed as declining issues outpaced advancers 480 to 406, with 107 issues unchanged. Among the losers were electricals, precision machineries and fishing industries. Constructions and foodstuffs also lost ground. Popular issues included housing and real estate. The dollar closed at 125.18 yen, down 0.52 yen from its close of 125.70 Thursday. It opened the day at 125.52 yen and ranged between 125.05 and 125.78 yen. `` The dollar was sold in the afternoon on a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report that monetary authorities from seven major industrialized nations will likely agree to maintain the dollar at the current level when they meet next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said an official of a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said, however, a wait-and-see attitude was strong among participants in advance of the next week's meeting and the scheduled release in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February.

<HEAD>Report Offers Extensive Data On China Agriculture, Population</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in recent years has been losing its rural people, despite an overall growth in the country's population, according to a new statistical report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> In 1982, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reported a population of more than 1.01 billion, a record 803.9 million, or 79 percent, lived in rural areas. By 1985 the total population was more than 1.04 billion, but rural residents were down to 662.9 million people, or 63 percent. Population figures and many others are included in a new edition of `` Agricultural Statistics of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, 1949-86,'' by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> and others of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> The new version, which was distributed Thursday, expands greatly an earlier statistical report on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s agriculture issued in 1984, which was the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s first since the communists took charge in 1949. Although not likely to make this spring's best-seller lists, the 158-page report is expected to be in great demand from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> watchers and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural traders interested in that potentially huge Asian market. The first edition in 1984 was 71 pages long. The report relies on `` the important, although still incomplete, agricultural data that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported during 1949-85, with some updates through 1986,' the authors said. Some 126 national and provincial tables of figures are included, along with an introduction, explanatory notes, references and suggested readings. Various sections include agricultural production; `` inputs'' such as farm machinery, fertilizer and labor; exports and imports; and consumption and procurement. The provincial tables include <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population by region and province; agricultural areas by crops; hog slaughter; horse and camel year-end inventory; milk production for cows and goats; and consumption by peasants. Officials said the report may be ordered from: Superintendent of Documents, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20402, or telephone -LRB- 202 -RRB- 783-3238.

Soybeans have the potential to supplement diets of low-income people in the Third World, where it will be important to gain consumer acceptance for soybeans and soy-fortified foods, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said Thursday in a new report. `` A historical view shows that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance of world soybean trade, founded on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research and development in the 1940s and 1950s, declined in the 1980s as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, spurred by high prices, developed large-scale production and processing facilities,'' he said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> have been the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitors in the international soybean market. <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON>, an agriculture and trade analyst in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, added: `` Their success, mainly in temperate areas, has not been duplicated in tropical areas elsewhere in the Third World. The major factors behind the increased demand for soybeans in the Third World, he said, are rising incomes and population growth. As families have more to spend, their demand increases for meat and other food products such as margarine and cooking oil. `` Fierce export competition with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> for these markets, as well as the developed country market, will likely continue,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. `` The expansion of large-scale soybean production in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will continue as long as soybean prices are high enough for Brazilian farmers to profitably open new lands for soybeans.'' Further encouragement would be in the Brazilian government's willingness to develop the rural transportation system connecting the new lands to ocean ports, he said `` If the price of soybeans is high relative to other crops, farmers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and elsewhere will find it profitable to switch even more of their existing cropland to soybeans,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said.

 Foreigners continue to own just under 1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural land, slightly more than the level of a year ago, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its 1987 year-end review of reports under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act found 12.5 million acres of agricultural land in foreign hands, 202,000 acres more than reported in 1986. Of the land owned by foreign interests, 50 percent was forest land, 17 percent cropland, 28 percent pasture and other agricultural land, and 5 percent used for non-agricultural purposes or unreported. Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land, with the balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other entities. As in the past, much of the ownership is concentrated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Those countries combined to account for 69 percent of the foreign-held acreage, the agency said. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign ownership, with holdings of almost 1.79 million acres, mostly timberland, or more than 14 percent of the total. `` Ninety-three percent of the foreign-owned acreage will remain in agricultural production, according to foreign owners,'' the report said.

<HEAD>London Shares Higher On Interest Rate Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices rose Friday when British commercial banks heeded a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> signal to cut their base lending rate. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index rose 12.6 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,773.6 at midday. Volume was light at 259.3 million shares at midday compared with 261.9 million shares at the same time Thursday. The commercial banks announced a cut in their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 8 percent, the lowest level in more than a decade. The banks cut the benchmark rate, effective Monday, after the central bank reduced its own money market rate by 0.375 percnet to 8 percent, apparently to stem the British pound's advance. `` That's what we want, some more good news like that,'' said one dealer, referring to the reduced interest rates. `` It should be just the tonic the market needs'' to take it higher. The dealer said the market had been sluggish all morning, held back in part by major new share issues by <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to help finance a tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a huge issue announced by <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. Other dealers were more wary of the benefits to equities from the interest rate cuts, saying the lower rates revive fears of inflationary pressures on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economy. One dealer also noted that the pound failed to show marked reaction shortly after the rate cut was announced, dampening the positive sentiment in the equity market.

<HEAD>Tate and Lyle Launches Tender Offer For Staley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major British sugar refiner and distributor, announced today a $ 1.33 billion cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest refiner of corn sweeteners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Tate and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, which already owns nearly 5 percent of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s stock, said it was offering $ 32 a share for the rest of its 30.4 million outstanding shares <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> stock closed at $ 30.12 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Wednesday. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> has proposed that <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> build on its stake acquired in November and become a more substantial minority shareholder, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said it decided to launch the tender offer instead. The acquisition would give <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> its first interest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sweetener market. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said it would become the only supplier of all three types of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are confident that, as part of <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> division, the performance and competitive position of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s corn activities will be significantly enhanced,'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. Tate and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said it began legal action in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to overturn takeover defenses established by <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, including a benefit package for its senior management. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said the offer will be partly funded by the sale of new shares to its existing shareholders, cash resources and a bank loan. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said it intends to sell <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s food distribution business, which <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> acquired in 1984 for $ 396 million, and that it was prepared to consider any offers immediately. The acquisition and stock issue must be approved by <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s shareholders, who are to meet on May 3. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s principal corn product is high fructose corn syrup, known as <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION>. The largest refiner of corn sweeteners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Archer-Daniels-Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials have begun talks on a merger that they say might require federal assistance. Fort Worth-based <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and San Antonio-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> issued separate statements Thursday, labeling the discussions as `` very preliminary.'' Bank officials would not say how much might be required from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are not at the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> with a gun at our heads,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> chairman. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said officials of the two banks, which began discussions last fall, believe <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance is needed to attract capital from investors. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION>, declined to say why his bank believes it needs <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance. If the two banks were combined, they would have $ 8 billion in assets ith 64 subsidiary banks and branches. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> estimated the companies could save from combining duplicative support facilities. According to 1987 figures released by the banks, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss in income of $ 78 million last year, with $ 5.17 billion in assets and about $ 3.99 billion in loans. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> reported a net loss of $ 64 million last year, with assets of about $ 2.8 billion and $ 1.8 billion in loans.

 The stock market headed higher today, continuing its rally over the past three sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 81.57 points over the last three trading days, rose 2.32 to 2,064.49 by 10 a.m. today on Wall Street.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 20.81 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.

In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government bonds showed some moderate gains, putting their yields in the 8.75 percent range.

The banks last cut the rate, by half a point, on March 17. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has been concerned about the strength of the pound against the West German mark since early March. The pound has been buoyed by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s relatively high interest rates, which make pound-denominated investments more attractive, stimulating demand for the currency. A stronger pound could hurt <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s exports and corporate profits. However, there have been concerns that rate cuts would spur inflation, which is running at a modest 3.3 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> bargainers have received their marching orders: win for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees the same pay, benefits and job protections enjoyed by their counterparts at the top two automakers. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council wrapped up a two-day strategy session here Thursday and voted to seek a return to labor parity between the No. 3 automaker and its larger rivals, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1979, the union's <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract has expired at different times than the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> pacts because the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract was reopened several times for company-saving concessions. But the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> will insist on a two-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> so all three pacts will expire together in 1990, adding to workers' bargaining power at a time when they will need it most because of the growing number of Japanese-owned factories building cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` There might be a wiggle here or there that will be different but the principles will be the same,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. `` We are ready to do battle for justice, economically and socially, with the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contract expires Sept. 14. Talks normally would begin in mid-July but the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreed to start early after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary ignited angry <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> opposition and left behind a bitter residue. The bargaining is set to begin April 18 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` We will take the pattern agreement and as closely as possible fits those provisions -LRB- to -RRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreement,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. The Chrysler council represents 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers, members of 49 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> locals. The council also voted nearly unanimously to accept some former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers into their fold under a compromise that ended days of potentially divisive debate. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last August and announced last fall it will close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, leaving 1,000 workers at a <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> engine plant and a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> parts distribution center to either bargain with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> on their own or come under the national contract. The soon-to-be-laid-off assembly plant workers will be covered under a separate plant closing agreement and will not join the union's <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council. Local leaders who did not want to admit the 1,000 <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers said they feared the former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> workers, whose seniority averages 18-20 years, would take jobs that otherwise might go to laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers. Under the compromise, the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers, unlike other <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers, will not be able to take their seniority with them if their plant closes or use their seniority to take openings in other plants ahead of workers already on layoff. `` We were n't looking for that anyway. We were looking to be covered under the same wages, hours and working conditions that all other <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers get,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON>, chairman of Local 72 at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. `` We know that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wants to close four plants in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area and it would be presumptuous of us to expect to move into other plants with our seniority,'' <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said. Local 72 President <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Steagall </PERSON> called the approval a miracle because of heated behind-the-scenes wrangling over the issue since before delegates began arriving Tuesday. The union's elected 10-member rank-and-file bargaining committee will have to negotiate both the demands package and the inclusion of the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in the talks. Last fall, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> won contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> that forbade layoffs for any reason except slow sales, banned plant closings not announced before negotiations and limited the top two automakers' ability to shift work to outside suppliers or to their own plants in other countries, including <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>

 King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> has called for `` solidarity'' among members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to bolster the target price of $ 18 a barrel, the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` If this is achieved, then there will be immense benefits and the prices of oil will always be on the increase,'' he told college students Thursday night while on inspection tour of the al-Qasseem region some 200 miles north of here. The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> monarch attributed the instability of oil prices to attempts by `` some'' to sell at discount prices, and expressed hope that adherence will be strict to production and price rulings laid down by the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. He affirmed that the kingdom `` has never at any time violated any agreement related to oil,'' thus adding yet another official denial to ongoing reports that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was also violating <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prices and selling at a discount because of the weak market. Fahd did not name any of the member states of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel that he accused of cheating on the rulings laid by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> for more than a year and designed to strengthen oil prices around an 18 dollars for benchmark crude. At <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s request, the five-member <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing committee is meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Saturday to consider ways and means of firming up the world market's flagging prices. Fahd's call for `` solidarity'' among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states was apparently aimed at pre-empting outbursts of inter-OPEC criticism to help the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> gathering formulate the proper recommendations. On Thursday, Iranian oil minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> of trying to destabilize the oil market by not agreeing to have the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting held at an earlier date. He said that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> blocked a call three months ago by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have the pricing committee convene. Committee members are oil ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Saudi Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> after calling on two major non-OPEC oil producers _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ seeking their cooperation in helping stabilize the market by restraining their output. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is the leading member of the cartel and alone possesses at least one-fifth of the world's proven oil reserves. Fahd stressed this point in his address saying that the kingdom `` now is one of the major countries with reserves in the ground that can suffice it for 200 years according to the estimates of world experts.''

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have agreed to create a bilateral consultative mechanism to seek price stability on the world petroleum market. The new mechanism was established `` to strive for the stability of the international petroleum market and the improvement of hydrocarbon prices,'' according to a statement released Thursday, following a meeting between <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parastatal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> also attended the talks. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> observed during the meeting that both oil-producing countries `` probably will remain in the world hydrocarbons market long after other exporting countries leave,'' according to the agency statement. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> but closely monitors its price and production guidelines. It was the world's fourth largest oil producer in 1985 but since has slipped to sixth place after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> agreed `` that the stability of the international petroleum market and improvemnt of hydrocarbon prices only can be brought about with the cooperation of all producing countries, members and non-members of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. Energy officials of both governments will meet periodically to evaluate the market situation, the statement added. On Monday, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s state oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> announced that it had lowered the price of its light Isthmus crude by $ 1.62 a barrel to Japanese customers in March. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> revealed in a statement that the price of its light oil was $ 13.86 a barrel in March, down from $ 15.48 a barrel in February.

<HEAD>GM Calls Wants Scaled Back Fuel Efficiency Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which helped persuade the government to reduce its car fuel economy regulations for each of the last three model years, has again called for the repeal or reduction of the rules. The No. 1 automaker said in a statement Thursday the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards are `` a disadvantage for full-line manufacturers'' that should be repealed or amended. Without some action, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it could be `` subject to civil penalties in the hundreds of millions of dollars'' and may be forced to `` close plants or severely restrict product offerings to remain in compliance.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and other automakers were successful in efforts to win reduced CAFE standars in 1986, 1987 and 1988. The government had set a fleetwide goal of 27.5 miles per gallon for 1988 models, but agreed to lower it to 26 mpg. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> anticipates compliance with the reduced level in 1988, but the standard is scheduled to return to 27.5 mpg in 1989 model year. The company has said it might fail to meet CAFE regulations in 1989 if gasoline prices remain stable or continue falling. Stable gas prices have made the less fuel-efficient six - and eight-cylinder cars more attractive to consumers Companies are allowed to borrow credits from past and future years in which they have exceeded or expect to exceed the standard as a way to reduce current non-compliance. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is asking the government to reduce retroactively the 1985 model year standard to 26 mpg from 27.5 mpg, which would give the company credit to offset any 1989 shortfalls. Other auto companies are doing the same.

 Specialist firms that control the rights to trade specific issues on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> will have to meet tough new capital requirements under the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s latest post-crash proposal. The capital plan, approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> board, is the latest in a series of steps taken to strengthen the market in the wake of Wall Street's October crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> now must consider the plan. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who follows the securities industry industry for <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the new proposal appears mainly designed to bolster confidence in the marketplace. He said it may help keep trading orderly, but would not prevent another severe decline. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that `` the vast majority of the specialists can meet'' the proposed new requirements today. Long said the new requirements could lead to more consolidation among specialists. The exchange currently has 54 specialist firms, which control the rights to market the stocks of the 1,650-plus companies listed on the exchange. Specialists are required to keep order in the market by setting opening prices and covering trades when there are not enough buyers or sellers. The specialist system came under scrutiny in the days following the Oct. 19 crash because of reports that some specialists failed to fulfill their roles during the market turmoil. Some specialist firms merged with bigger firms or had to give up their roles because of shattering financial damage suffered in the crash. Since the crash, five stock specialists have agreed voluntarily to give up their roles as market makers on the exchange. Under the proposed changes, a specialist firm must show it can meet, with its own liquid assets, a minimum capital requirement of $ 1 million or be able to buy 15,000 shares of each common stock in which it makes a market, whichever is greater. The rules currently require minimum capital of $ 100,000 or the ability to buy 5,000 shares in each stock in which the specialist makes a market. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of the exchange, said one question asked repeatedly since the crash has been, `` Would the condition of the market during the week of Oct. 19 have been better than it was if specialists had more capital?'' `` The simple answer was ` no,' and the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> agreed with that conclusion,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said, referring to the presidential commission that investigated the causes of the crash. But <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the crash and subsequent volatility of the stock market served to `` underscore the need for strengthening the specialist system'' and he said the proposed changes were `` an appropriate interim step to be taken now to bolster confidence'' in it. He said other measures concerning the adequacy of the specialists' capital requirements are under review. Among other post-crash steps the exchange has announced previously was a curb on computerized program trading, which takes effect when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average moves 50 points in either direction from the previous day's close in one session. That curb was activated for the first time on Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s rise surpassed 50 points in the last hour of trading. The Dow finished with a gain of 64.16 points for the day. The exchange has also announced it has begun taking steps to improve its ability to handle heavy trading volumes.

 Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent during March, the lowest monthly figure since November 1985, the central <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> announced. It said late Thursday that inflation recorded for the first three months of the year reached 31.5 percent, compared to 23.6 percent in the same period of 1987. Inflation last year soared to a record 159.2 percent annual figure. The government put into effect controls on wages and prices for goods and services it regulates in March, the second phase of a so-called Economic Solidarity Pact intended to brake hyperinflation and reduce it to 1 to 2 percent monthly by the end of the year. Under the program, the value of the peso _ 2,280 to the dollar _ and the minimum daily wage of 8,000 pesos, or about $ 3.50, will remain steady through the end of May.

 Bonds posted moderate price gains while interest rates retreated in early trading today. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue, which on Thursday lost about \ point, or $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 face amount, rose about $ 5 by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 8.73 percent from 8.77 percent. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brachfeld </PERSON>, executive vice president in charge of fixed income at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the rebound largely to technical factors stemming from the dollar. Investors who had been betting on a decline in the credit markets bought bonds to cover their short positions prior to next week's meeting among the seven biggest industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, he said. Analysts speculate that the G-7 will push for currency stabilization, thereby strengthening the dollar and pushing bond prices up. The dollar is closely watched by the credit markets as a sign of where inflation might be headed. A rising dollar lessens the prospect of import-led inflation and makes dollar-denominated bonds and notes more attractive to foreigners. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments rose about \ point, intermediate maturities were 3-16 point to 9-32 point higher and long-term issues were up about -RRB- point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value.

 A fired <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> broker accused of fatally shooting his former boss, who was chased from his office and pistol-whipped in front of about 60 company workers, was ordered held on $ 500,000 bail today. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, did not offer a plea at his arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> ordered his case continued until April 19, said court clerk <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> had complained of racial discrimination, but was fired because of `` poor performance,'' a newspaper quoted sources as saying. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, 56, a senior vice president and 31-year <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> employee, was meeting with <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> when he was shot Thursday, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, national director of security for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> then fled into the main office and <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> chased him for about 30 feet, beating him on the head with the .22 caliber pistol until <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> collapsed, witnesses said. At that point, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> pumped more shots into him while he was on the floor.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> was hit in the chest, back, arm and side with four of a total of nine bullets fired, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> collapsed in the 36th-floor downtown office, three workers wrestled <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> to the floor. `` I do n't know what went on between them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON> of the meeting between <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> was n't able to say much. I think he was already in shock ... `` <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, had worked for the company for less than two years and was fired Wednesday for inefficient performance. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> declined to be more specific about the reasons behind the firing. He said he did not know whether <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> had been scheduled. An unnamed associate was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> went through eight jobs in 11 years before joining <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in June 1986. He was told repeatedly that he would have to `` start performing'' there or lose his job, the associate said. `` <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> was doing very poorly,'' said an unidentified friend who told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> he talked to <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> by telephone Wednesday night, and that <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> gave no indication that he had been fired. `` He was bright but he could n't communicate or sell. He could n't bring in the revenue but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> was trying to help him along.'' The newspaper said <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> made only $ 17,051 in commissions in his first year, less than 20 percent of the average $ 100,000 in commissions a first-year broker makes, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Since October, <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> had received $ 6,491 in commissions, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed sources as saying <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> was heard to complain that his bosses' growing criticism of his weak sales volume at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> was racially motivated. `` <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> was taking this as racial, but it was just poor performance,'' one source said. <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON>, who lived with his mother, filed a racial discrimination complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> three years ago, claiming <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION> refused to give him a job because he was black. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said it did n't hire <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> because he asked for too much money. The commission dismissed the complaint on grounds of insufficient evidence. A <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> office manager in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was killed and another broker wounded after last October's stock market plunge by a customer who had been told he owed $ 138,000. The investor, who then killed himself, had seen his stock holdings drop $ 2.5 million in value after the Oct. 19 market collapse.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Friday asked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to clarify the terms of an accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opening Japanese public works projects to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. `` If it turned out that this agreement would be yet another bilateral deal between these two countries to the exclusion of others, that would be very damaging,'' <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has criticized past efforts by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open Japanese markets through preferential bilateral accords. Last month the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said parts of a U.S.-Japanese accord on trade in semiconductors violated its international rules of commerce. The public works deal was signed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We take this affair very seriously, not only because of the amount of potential trade involved but also because we feel that bilateral deals are hurting the spirit of free trade,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said in a statement. He said he would raise the issue at a meeting in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> next week of trade officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. The public works accord signed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON>, was termed a declaration of intent rather than a formal bilateral agreement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said it was intended to provide market access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> engineering and construction firms and for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers of a wide range of equipment for projects financed directly or indirectly with Japanese government funds. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said he has not yet seen the text of the accord but sought `` an immediate, official declaration by the Japanese government clarifying the situation.'' `` There is a need for a binding commitment sufficiently specific to reassure the -LRB- EEC -RRB- and its industry that the latter will be able to bid for work under these major projects on an equal and non-discriminatory basis with regard to both Japanese and third country competitors,'' he said.

 Less than six months after the global market collapse, <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> stock prices have surged above pre-crash levels, thanks to market resilience and renewed confidence in the country's healthy economy `` People have realized the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market has certain strengths,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> investment firm. The main index of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest in terms of money invested, fell 15 percent last October in the session after the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell a record 508 points, or 23 percent. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues finished making up all its lost ground as it surpassed its pre-crash level and reached its highest level in history, 26,769.22. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index slipped less than 0.1 percent, losing 20.33 points to close at 26,748.89. The Dow Jones index, meanwhile, still languishes more than 8 percent below its level of the day before the crash and 24 percent below its peak of last August. Other world stock exchanges are also below pre-crash levels. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the Vickers da Costa investment firm said the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market had been pushed by factors `` intrinsic and unique to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' which had more to do with underlying domestic economic factors that could not be applied internationally. `` They were Japanese reasons,'' he said. Some of them are low interest rates, high corporate profits, strong economic growth estimated at a 7 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 1987 and inflation so low that consumer prices in February were 0.7 percent below a year earlier. Also, investors are reassured by controls on price movements of stocks, which they believe protect the market against a crash, <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> said. Still, some Japanese officials worry that the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is bouncing back too fast. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that stock prices have risen too rapidly in relation to economic growth. Many investment strategists remain optimistic. <PERSON> Hisamichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON>, chief strategist at the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> investment firm, said the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market is sensitive to corporate earnings, and the Nikkei's rise was powered by substantial improvements in company profits. `` The domestic sector is now growing by more than 6 percent,'' <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> said. Other analysts agree, and say the economy's overall growth _ compensating for a decline in exports _ will be 4 to 4.5 percent this year. <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> attributed the market's resilience to a `` substantial level of liquidity and low interest rates.'' The prime lending rate in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is 5.5 percent. `` Investor sentiment is very optimistic,'' <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> said. `` Money is flowing into the market from bond investments and savings accounts.'' Traders also agreed that a stable foreign exchange rate is contributing strongly to the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing bullish performance. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fluctuated mainly in a narrow range of 125 to 128 yen last month. `` People realized the dollar was not headed for 120 yen as quickly as they originally thought,'' said <PERSON> Clap </PERSON> <PERSON> Ham </PERSON>, director of research at <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. `` Removal of this fear has pushed the market up,'' he added. Many analysts said the country's system of government control over daily market movements also played a substantial role in fueling the rise. `` There is no doubt about it,'' said <PERSON> Ham </PERSON>. Investors are bound to feel comfortable with `` a market secured in government intervention.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> determines daily price-change limits for stocks from their previous day's closing level. At the bottom end, shares closing at less than 100 yen -LRB- 79 cents -RRB- are allowed to move a maximum of 30 yen -LRB- 24 cents -RRB- up or down, while at the top, those closing above 10,000 yen -LRB- $ 79 -RRB-, are given a maximum fluctuation of 2,000 yen -LRB- $ 16 -RRB-. Trading offers outside the stock's allowed range are not accepted, meaning shares with quick price changes sometimes are not traded for much of a session. Traders say the restrictions greatly inhibited the flow of money out of the market at the time of the crash, thereby limiting the overall decline. `` The limits had a positive calming influence on the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kleinwort </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The `` close relationship between the administration and institutions'' had an `` important role and slowed the rate of fall.'' <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ham </PERSON> described the government as `` a guardian angel'' who will do whatever is needed to keep the market from falling. He added that numerous American investors have recently come into the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, lured by the perceived benefits of the Japanese system. But while some analysts are predicting the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index will continue up _ possibly nearing the 30,000 mark by the end of summer _ they stopped short of saying <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, already the world's largest market in terms of total value of shares, will replace <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in dictating future market trends <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market will continue to wield a strong influence over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> activity. `` Assuming <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does not drop significantly or remains at its present level, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market will move up,'' he said. He predicted prices will be bolstered by a new buying mood among the `` many financial institutions, including insurance firms and trust banks, who missed the bus because the market went up'' quicker than they expected.

<HEAD>One Millionth Car Rolls Off Assembly Line; Hondas Arrive in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> celebrated two milestones Friday when its one millionth U.S.-produced car rolled off the assembly line and its first exported cars rolled onto a dock in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A Civic four-door sedan was driven off the assembly line at <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Manufacturing's auto plant in his central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city, becoming the one millionth American-made car since <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> started building cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November 1982. Halfway around the world, a shipload of 540 Honda Accords built at the <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> plant arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, ending a monthlong journey that started on March 7 from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. The one millionth car was driven by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinzer </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first employee when he was hired as manager of administration in 1978. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> calls its employees associates. `` We owe our ability to produce 1 million cars in such a short period of time to the teamwork and efforts of our associates,'' said <PERSON> Kinzer </PERSON>, now vice president and plant manager of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s engine plant in <LOCATION> Anna </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` They have proven that <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> quality knows no geographical boundaries.'' The arrival of the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Accords signaled an end to a voyage that was interrupted when the ship's ballast tank and fuel tank cracked during a storm in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on the third day at sea. It returned to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and left again on March 17. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the company does not have facilities in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to build the American-made coupe. `` It was built for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. We see the car as an American car,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's fourth-largest car company in sales and manufacturing. It began manufacturing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in September 1979 with production at its motorcycle plant in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>. Production at the <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> auto plant began Nov. 1, 1982, with the Accord four-door sedan. The Civic four-door sedan was added to production on July 24, 1986. Production of the engine for the Civic began at <LOCATION> Anna </LOCATION> on Sept. 23, 1986. The company in February began construction for a new assembly plant near its <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> operation. The new plant, called the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to begin production of Civic four-door sedans in August 1989.

 The stock market posted some spotty gains today, struggling to extend its rally of the past three sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 81.57 points over the last three trading days, rose 6.46 to 2,068.63 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 792 up, 625 down and 498 unchanged. The market has benefited lately from signs that the dollar has steadied in foreign-exchange, reducing fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon tighten credit. In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government bonds showed some moderate gains, putting their yields in the 8.75 percent range.

<HEAD>Testing Firm Wins 14-Year Battle With Federal Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Baltimore-based electrical testing company has won a 14-year battle with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and broken two other companies' hold on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for product testing. <ORGANIZATION> MET </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tried for more than a decade to get the federal agency to set standards for the national accreditation of product testing firms, and change a regulation that specifically listed two laboratories and thus kept others out. After settling two lawsuits brought in federal district court by MET, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday will publish standards for accreditation in the Federal Register. `` It's been a long time coming,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Frier </PERSON>, MET's founder and president The existing, and soon to be defunct, regulation says that testing shall be done by a nationally-recognized company, such as <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frier </PERSON> said that for many years <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has had a virtual monopoly on the sort of electrical testing his company does That firm, established by the insurance industry in 1890, was not a party to any of the legal actions. `` The only thing they're guilty of,'' <PERSON> Frier </PERSON> said, `` is running a great public relations effort.'' <PERSON> Frier </PERSON>'s objections in correspondence and the lawsuits has been to the specific reference to UL, which tests more than 12,500 products, including consumer electrical appliances, and Boston-area FM, which primarily tests fire safety products. He said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s regulation kept companies like his from certifying the safety of products that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> itself will recognize as proper for the workplace, said <PERSON> Frier </PERSON>. UL, which has headquarters in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and additional laboratories in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, had no comment Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s setting a time for the publication of new standards. Founded by insurance companies, <ORGANIZATION> UL </ORGANIZATION> now is an independent, not-for-profit corporation. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, Mass.-based FM also had no comment Friday. The <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> businessman first requested that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> set standards for accrediting testing firms in March 1974. His firm, which depends on field testing rather than new-product testing for its revenues, was growing and for several years he did not press the matter with <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. Then in May 1982 <PERSON> Frier </PERSON> brought suit against the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, who has ultimate responsibility for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. Before the suit came to trial, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> settled the legal action by agreeing to re-write an existing reference to accreditation by March 1984. Although <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> agreed that it would change its regulation, it did not and last June MET went back to federal court, charging that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> had breached the settlement. In December, a federal judge directed <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to comply with the settlement and set a time limit for publication of standards. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION> resident who heads <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of electrical and electronics safety standards, said Thursday that part of the long delay was due to `` the number of reviews that are necessary for something like this.'' He said there was agreement at <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> `` several years ago'' that its regulation `` kept other companies out, but for various reasons the changes just never moved forward.'' MET also has a branch in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. It has 125 employees and annual revenues of about $ 3.5 million.

<HEAD>$80 Million Grocery Leaves Couple Overdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No matter how many prime ribs or steaks <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> placed in her shopping cart, her husband knew the grocery trip did not cost what his bank account indicated _ $ 80 million. `` I was a little surprised. I knew it was a mistake,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 41, on Friday. An innocent shopping trip March 23 to a local supermarket cost $ 121.78, but a bank error added another $ 80 million to the purchase, making it perhaps the most expensive grocery trip in history. Mrs. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> had paid for the groceries with an automated teller card from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, an electronics technician for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, said he realized something was wrong several days later when he could n't withdraw money from their account. He tried unsuccessfully several times to withdraw money. Then, somewhat perplexed, he called up his balance. `` This huge number with a minus sign comes spilling out,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. Since the automated teller only goes up to $ 1 million, the machine showed his account overdrawn for that amount. Despite this shock, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> wanted to purchase some flags and went to a flag store. `` I said ` I think I'm a million dollars short, so can I write a check?''' Since the owner knew him, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> was allowed to write a check. He then called his bank's 24-hour hotline to notify them of the mistake. The bank, he said, insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrongs </ORGANIZATION> had mistakenly written a check for $ 80 million. He noted, however, that $ 80,000,121.78 had been deducted from their account. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> finally deduced that the bank's mistake stemmed from the $ 121.78 check for the grocery trip. Still, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> was left without money last weekend. `` I was penniless. I had to rob my kid's piggy banks,'' he said. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> corrected the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrongs </ORGANIZATION>' bank balance on Tuesday. A bank spokeswoman said it was a clerical error. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said that even though he realized it was a mistake, it was hard to be without money on Easter weekend for his family, including his two children. `` It's pretty tough to convice people, ` Hey I'm $ 80 million dollars short, can you lend me a hundred dollars,''' he said.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Reports 20 Percent Drop In Passenger Miles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced that the number of paying passenger miles it flew in March and its passenger volume dropped 20 percent from the same month a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it flew 2.82 billion revenue passenger miles in March, down from 3.53 billion in March 1987. A revenue passenger mile, or RPM, represents one paying passenger flown one mile and is used to determine an airline's capacity Passenger volume for March also fell 20 percent, to 3.51 million passengers from 4.39 million a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The figures are very misleading,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>. `` Last year our passenger volume was artificially high because we were in the midst of our MaxSaver -LRB- deep disount -RRB- fares. We had fares as low as $ 79 to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -LRB- from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> -RRB- _ that really increased our discretionary travelers.'' She also said Eastern had more seats available a year ago. The airline's capacity declined 13.1 percent in March, to 4.50 billion available seat miles from 5.18 billion a year earlier. Last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declared Eastern in contempt of court for trying to sell its profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle to giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent Eastern's management remains embroiled in negotiations with its machinists union, which is fighting $ 490 million in proposed job cuts at the airline.

<TEXT>
 Many developers nibbled, but few bit at beachfront hotels for sale at an auction designed to breathe new life into a stretch of sand and surf battered by slumping tourism and broken spring breaks. Only two of 11 properties sold at the private auction Thursday night that was marked by bids thousands of dollars below what hotel owners were seeking. `` These bidders do n't realize they're buying <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, not the backwoods of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> factory worker who had sold his home and invested his life savings last year to buy a hotel for $ 650,000. His property fetched a top bid of just $ 350,000. `` I'm not going to give my property away,'' <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said. `` We'll just hang in there and do the best we can.'' Tourism officials and real estate analysts had viewed the auction as a test of private interest in redeveloping the city's beachfront strip The city of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> is planning a $ 13.8 million beach revitalization as it tries to turn the beach from a spring break haven into an area of luxury resorts. That plan hinges on private development. `` If it busts, the negative connotation will be that the potential to upgrade the property just is n't there,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Goodkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. The auction at the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> Mar Resort and <ORGANIZATION> Yachting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> drew about 30 registered bidders and some 600 spectators. An 81-unit beachfront property sold for $ 2.1 million and an 18-unit motel sold for $ 542,000. Owners of the 11 properties agreed to the auction because the decline of spring break has brought declining profits. They say city officials in the past few years have restricted the students' activities so much they have chosen to travel to other vacation spots `` I've worked hard, but after a while you get burned out on beating your head against the wall,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Handevidt </PERSON>, one motel owner. `` I've tried to attract people down here and to increase tourism in the area only to be shot down by the city.'' Each property owner contributed $ 3,000 to an international marketing campaign for the auction, to which co-organizer <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> added about $ 10,000 `` When you're talking about all-cash deals, it's difficult,'' said <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, senior vice president of the auction company. `` But we're hoping to negotiate several more deals in the next few days.''

 The federal <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> dealt a serious blow to three shareholders' joint attempt to gain majority control of <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> <PERSON> Verlag </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest publishing company. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frieder </PERSON> <PERSON> Burda </PERSON>, who have their own printing operations, and media entrepreneur <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirch </PERSON> pooled their <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> shares last month in an effort to forge a majority. But the <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that their combined shares had fallen short of that goal. `` At the moment the pool has not had much of an effect. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirch </PERSON> is still a long way even from 25 percent -LRB- of the shares -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangemann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, a spokesman for <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> employees said workers would fight attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> and the Burdas to gain control of the company. The spokesman, <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Juergensen </PERSON>, said employees are worried that <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> would lead the company into extensive involvement with electronic media, which could mean a loss of jobs for <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s print workers The highly successful <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> empire includes the Bild tabloid with a daily circulation of about 5 million and dozens of other mass-circulation publications. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamm </PERSON> urged that `` for the benefit of the company, all participants -LRB- in the power struggle -RRB- reach a rational solution as soon as possible.'' Addressing a meeting of <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> employee representatives, <PERSON> Tamm </PERSON> also said any solution should give top consideration to `` security for workers ... and to a stable leadership.'' Executives of the publishing house have been squabbling ever since the death of company founder <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> in 1985. Under a complicated formula, <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s heirs and executors were given control of 27.1 percent of the company shares, the <PERSON> Burda </PERSON> brothers 25.9 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> 10 percent. The rest were sold to the public. <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> had maintained that he gained support from the owners of another 16 percent of <LOCATION> Springer </LOCATION> stock, which would give him and the Burdas a combined majority. <PERSON> Friede </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, the widow of the founder, has been fighting the attempts by the <LOCATION> Burdas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> to gain majority control. <ORGANIZATION> Kirch </ORGANIZATION> is involved in film distribution and production and other media areas.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 10th largest bank holding company, said Friday that its first-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago even though it raised its loan-loss reserves to cover troubled Third World debt. Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $ 141.5 million, or $ 2.38 per share, compared with earnings of $ 63.9 million, or $ 1.06 a share, in 1987. Chairman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said improvement was made across the board during the period. `` Our performance this quarter was outstanding in all aspects of the consumer and middle-market banks _ the superregional segment of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> _ as well as in the global corporate bank,'' he said in a statement. Net interest income rose 14 percent, to $ 315.3 million from $ 277.9 million last year, while interest expense totaled $ 615.92 million, up from $ 515.92 million. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said it increased its provision for loan losses to $ 100 million from $ 75 million, half of which went to cover shaky foreign debt. `` We are continuing to see improvements in credit quality ... and we are continuing to maintian one of the strongest reserve positions for troubled-country debtors among our peers,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> noted. Quarterly non-interest income totaled $ 249.0 million, compared with $ 173.1 million last year. Non-interest expense rose to $ 311.5 million form $ 265.4 million.

<HEAD>International Banks Urge New Money Creation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The International Monetary Fund should create about $ 29.5 billion worth of its own new money to help keep the dollar and other world currencies stable and to help solve the Third World debt problem, a leading group of the world's commercial banks proposed Friday. The idea came from <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>, the West German managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 165 banks in 38 countries. `` Not every one of the banks would endorse every line, but there's a consensus,'' <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> told a news conference. His nine-page outline was made public on the eve of next week's semiannual meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the fund and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Leading bankers and government financial leaders are due to attend, including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The new money would be given to member governments in proportion to their status in the fund. That means the wealthiest countries would get the biggest shares, including about $ 5.9 billion worth to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would get more than $ 2 billion, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about $ 1.8 billion, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> $ 1.5 billion and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 1.4 billion. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could use this money for dealing on currency exchange markets to keep the dollar stable while other governments could hold more of this currency instead of dollars. At the news conference, he suggested that many believe they already hold too many dollars. The fund, owned by 151 governments, makes few public statements and had no official comment on the proposal. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said that he has had favorable comment privately. Representatives of Third World countries and some wealthier industrial governments have urged similar issues of new money by the fund in past years. They have come up against stiff refusal from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who said it would promote inflation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the biggest single block of votes in fund matters. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> wants the fund to create 21.4 billion more of its `` special drawing rights,'' known as SDR's. These are now worth about $ 1.38 each, based on the price of four other major currencies as well as the dollar: the West German mark, the British pound, the French franc and the Japanese yen. SDR's are handled only by governments and a few special governmental bodies. They exist not as coins or paper money but only as entries in ledgers and computers. The 15 heavily-indebted Third World countries, singled out by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> for special help two years ago, would get about $ 3 billion worth among them. Most of these countries are in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Third World governments have in the past asked that the rules be changed so that their share would be larger, but <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> gave no support to that. `` It would be wrong to change the quotas in the fund,'' he said. `` These issues are for the needs of general international liquidity.'' He added that he did not rule out the possibility of the wealthier countries turning over their shares to the bank and fund, which could then make more loans to the Third World. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> acknowledged that critics of his plan might call it a bailout for commercial banks. `` Commercial banks and other creditors would benefit from the improved creditworthiness of debtor countries,'' the proposal says. It suggests that debtor countries could use their shares to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars as collateral for new borrowing from banks, or to swing deals that would convert their old debts to banks into something else that banks would prefer to have. One possibility is the debt-equity swap, in which debt owed by Third World countries are exchanged at less than their face value for shares in businesses.

 <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively scheduled a May 31 flight between <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. Soviet officials have yet to approve the flight, but unofficially they appear to favor the idea, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official helping to organize the flight. `` There's a lot of interest from the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It's aware of this project and they're excited about possibly getting involved,'' said <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, public relations director for the chamber. Commercial flights between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were banned for several years following the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, but the prohibition was lifted about two years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline that flies between the two countries, operating flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a stopover in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce non-stop flights in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet national airline, starting May 15. For most of the post-war era, almost all contact between <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has been cut off. And in recent years, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> has been the scene of major military buildups by both nations. But last year relations began to warm. The Soviets allowed American <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> to swim between two islands that straddle the border in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, permitted an exchange of medical researchers from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing groups to discuss joint seafood ventures. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Cancelmi </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the airline would donate the use of a plane for the half-hour flight between <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and the Siberian city. The carrier has applied for authority to begin regularly scheduled service between the two cities next year. But <PERSON> Cancelmi </PERSON> stressed that <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> still needs more technical information about <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>'s airport, as well as a formal nod from the Soviets, before the May flight can take place. In addition to dignitaries, the flight would also carry a group of western <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Eskimos who hope to be reunited with long-lost relatives in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The flight is part of a broader initiative that state, university and chamber officials have launched to improve <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Known as the Siberian Gateway Project, the goals include expanded trade and tourism between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hunts, Banks Near Settlement of Dispute Involving $1.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers and the 23 foreign and domestic banks they are battling are nearing settlement in their dispute over $ 1.5 billion in loans, attorneys said. Both sides have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to suspend reorganization hearings on the Hunts' <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until the negotiations are complete, attorneys said. `` Negotiations are at the stage where the major parties have come to what I call a handshake deal,'' Placid attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said Thursday. `` That deal is not in writing, and the handshake is not now binding, but it does represent at least a conclusion of an intensive series of all the Placid-related issues.'' Neither <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickes </PERSON> _ key negotiators for the case _ would discuss the substance of the negotiations. But the settlement would have to include what to do about $ 200 million in penalty interest, attorney fees and costs the banks claim against Placid. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> filed suit in federal court nearly two years ago against the 23 banks, alleging they were fraudulently squeezing the Hunts into accepting increasingly difficult loan terms for a $ 1.5 billion debt. A countersuit was filed by the banks, demanding immediate payment on what the banks contended were legitimate loans in default. Six weeks later, the banks posted for foreclosure key Hunt assets securing the defaulted loans. The Hunts protected themselves by placing Placid and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s personal trust under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. They later did the same with the other brothers' trusts. Both sides have since been warring in federal and bankruptcy courts, maneuvering for a possible death blow or at least some kind of legal advantage. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> in January allowed the banks a $ 7.8 million first lien against revenues from the Hunts' Green Canyon drilling project in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> The lien represented money Placid had spent on <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> in violation of a court order. When the Hunts experienced cost overruns _ including the loss of nine miles of pipe being towed to the site _ the project's outside investors declined to cover the loss. The outside investors, <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> media giant <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON>, said they would commit more money only if the bankruptcy judge put those funds ahead of the banks' prior lien The banks' desire to close <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s balking at considering the need for additional money an emergency, `` brought Placid to the table,'' one bank attorney said. Without Green Canyon, <PERSON> Placid </PERSON>'s reorganization plan would be untenable and, by default, <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> would have accepted the bank plan calling for the outright sale of Placid.

It could come, they say, from a meeting of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, or from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance for February. Advance estimates call for the trade data to show continuing improvement from the record levels it reached last fall. Brokers also say investors are looking for generally strong corporate earnings reports for the first quarter over the next few weeks.

<HEAD>Sharon Steel, British Investor Bid For Idle Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bankruptcy court judge is expected to rule Monday on which of the bidders from around the world should be authorized to buy major portions of an idled <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant. Bids for the plant in <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, came from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The plant is on the block as part of <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws The bids were considered by <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON> on Thursday, which was the deadline. The judge postponed his decision over the objection of <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors. The sale is a crucial issue in <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION>, whose economy has suffered through the loss of 3,500 jobs that once existed at the plant. The front-runners appeared to be British industrialist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a holding of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> that is also in Chapter 11. Sharon bid $ 16 million for the coke batteries, iron and steel furnaces and related rolling mills. <ORGANIZATION> BMAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company, offered $ 15 million Both bids carried complex conditions on payment schedules, interest rates, royalties and other issues. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON>, said his company desperately needs a supply of coke to fuel its newly refurbished ironmaking furnace in <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> might be forced to close one of its two blast furnaces if it can not get coke from <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> attorney threatened to withdraw the bid because <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON> would not rule immediately. BMAC until recently was the only bidder for the plant. The company signed a letter of intent in December to buy the coke ovens, which convert coal to blast furnace fuel. Australian businessman <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> offered $ 60 million for the entire plant, but <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON> said the offer `` had conditions in it that are impossible to meet.'' Among them was a requirement that <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, whose primary plant is in <LOCATION> Steubenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to purchase 22 million tons of low-grade iron ore from him over the next 10 years. Mon <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a local investors' group led by <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlow </PERSON>, bid $ 14 million for all but the plant's rail mill, which forms semi-finished steel into rail for transportation <PERSON> Carlow </PERSON> was unwilling to drop an important condition that could deduct $ 2 million from the purchase price. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and BMAC agreed to drop the same condition. <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON>, meanwhile, granted the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a 120-day extension to solicit new bids for the 7-year-old rail mill, the centerpiece of the <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION> Works.

<HEAD>Women In Sales Play Isolated Role In Some Industries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women in sales forces tend to represent a strong portion of housewares, publishing and food products industries, but few sell tools, hardware and general machinery, a study found. `` Over the past decade, the most significant advances for women in sales have been in banking, financial services, utilities and publishing,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, head of sales management practice for the company that conducted the study, <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` In these industries, where there is no apparent gender-related consumer bias, sheer numbers women have equalled or surpassed their male counterparts on the sales force,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said Friday. The data for the study, conducted earlier this year, came from 12,000 salespeople employed by nearly 350 companies representing 40 industries. According to the study, the industries with the greatest percentage of women in their sales forces are textile and apparel, utilities, banks and financial services, housewares, publishing and food products. The industries with the smallest percentage of women in their sales forces are general machinery, aerospace, transportation equipment, tools and hardware, automotive parts and fabricated metal products, the study found. `` Our hypothesis is that selling such technical items as tools and hardware requires some engineering and technical background, which statistics have shown, women have not gotten into,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. But, he said, the sales managers he surveyed indicated that women tend to be better performers in the industries where they are selling.

 The dollar drifted lower Friday while the British pound held its ground despite an apparent attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> to stem its rise by slashing interest rates. Gold prices were higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 449 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up 15 cents an ounce from $ 448.85 late Thursday. Trading in the dollar remained hemmed in a narrow range before a meeting next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, of the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies. Dealers said they expect the finance ministers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to reaffirm their wish to keep the dollar stable. `` The central banks are very happy about what they've done over the past few months. They've taken a lot of the speculative character out of the market _ which is bad for the traders, of course,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wild </PERSON>, first vice president of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Julius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> The foreign exchange market was taken by surprise when the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> engineered a half-point cut in the commercial banks' base lending rate to 8 percent at midday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> But the rate cut `` appears to have gotten the same reaction as yesterday's intervention,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Salle </PERSON>, a senior manager at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign exchange department in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> intervened Thursday to stem sterling's rise, also with minimal results. Other traders pointed out that British interest rates are still higher than in other countries. That makes pound-denominated investments more attactive and boosts demand for the currency. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound was quoted at $ 1.8755 compared with late Thursday's $ 1.8670. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound finished the day at $ 1.8757, unchanged from late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 125.18 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 125.50 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar finished at 125.68, down from 125.72 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.6742 West German marks, down from 1.6776; 1.3842 Swiss francs, down from 1.3864; 1.2469 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2483; 5.6775 French francs, down from 5.6885; and 1,241.13 Italian lire, down from 1,243.75. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6810; 1.3825 Swiss francs, down from 1.3897; 5.6715 French francs, down from 5.7022; 1.8790 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8865; 1,241.75 Italian lire, down from 1,246.50; and 1.2478 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2448. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 451.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 447.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was rose to a bid $ 449.50 an ounce compared with $ 448 late Thursday.

The <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> action was in response to a March 17 suit filed in the same court against it and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>, which charged them with infringing upon copyright audio and visual display technology for Macintosh personal computers. Apple's civil suit said software products made by <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> make use of Macintosh technology without permission. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s counterclaims and answer asked that <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s suit be dismissed. It also sought damages against the <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, computer maker for breach of contract between the two companies, for interference with <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s contractual relations with other companies, for harming <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s `` prospective business advantage,'' for slander of <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s title to its Windows 2.03 software product and for violations of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> unfair business and practices laws. Apple spokesmen failed to return phone calls Friday seeking comment on the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s suit had said <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s Windows 2.03, a graphics program used with <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> software, are `` illegal copies of the Macintosh audio-visual works and exceed the limited license rights <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> previously granted to <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>.'' The suit asked that <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> be prevented from copying, selling or marketing <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s New Wave software and Windows 2.03. Apple also sought unspecified damages. Windows operates with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and compatible computers using <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s MS-DOS operating system. New Wave provides an audio-visual display upon which applications software can be run. In its countersuit, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> said Windows 2.03 does n't infringe on any Apple copyright or patent and that <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> did n't contribute to any alleged copyright infringement by <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> The software company also asked the court to require <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> to live up to a 1985 settlement agreement concerning the use of the visual displays in question.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major British sugar refiner and distributor, announced Friday a $ 1.33 billion cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest refiner of corn sweeteners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, which already owns nearly 5 percent of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s stock, said it was offering $ 32 a share for all the remaining common stock <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadows </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, will have no comment on any aspect of the offer until its lawyers examine the proposal, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON>. But there was speculation the bidding may go higher. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> climbed $ 5.87 -LCB- a share to $ 37.37 -LCB- in active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> managing director for <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, said at a <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, news conference that the $ 32 price was fair. `` We prepared to launch our bid at a time when the price for <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> shares was in the low 20s,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what may happen to the price on the market but we believe the $ 32 is a full and fair offer for the shares of the company.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s interest in the company `` is a fundamental interest in the business,'' not a passing financial interest. `` We're not financial entrepreneurs or corporate raiders,'' he said. `` We're manufacturing people involved in the processing businesses not only here in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but in other countries as well.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> had previously proposed that <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> increase its stake acquired in November and become a more substantial minority shareholder. But <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said it decided to launch the tender offer instead. The acquisition would give <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> its first interest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sweetener market. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said it would become the only supplier of all three types of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are confident that, as part of <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> American division, the performance and competitive position of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s corn activities will be significantly enhanced,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>.

 The stock market rang up its fourth straight gain Friday with a strong advance that carried the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to a new high since the October crash. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 28.02 points to 2,090.19, bringing its gain for the week to 102.13 points. The average's previous closing high for the year was 2,087.37 on March 18.

It could come, they say, from a meeting of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, or from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance for February.

<TEXT>
 Five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders gathered here Friday for talks that analysts said would test the cartel's resolve to combat a global oil price slump. Prices on world markets slipped slightly in quiet trading. Brent blend crude from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for May delivery at $ 15.60 a barrel, down 10 cents from Thursday's close. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, May contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, stood at $ 16.88 per barrel, down 18 cents. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s oil minister said on his arrival that the meeting, set to start Saturday, was unlikely to produce any changes in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' current oil policy. `` I do n't think we'll decide anything that will change the past decision of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' the minister, <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON>, told reporters as he prepared for his first <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> session since taking over his country's top oil post in March. In the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, the official Saudi press agency quoted King Fahd as calling on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to display greater solidarity. It said he accused some unidentified cartel members of cheating on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> rules by offering price discounts. Last December, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to retain existing oil production quotas for the individual member countries in hope of holding prices at $ 18 a barrel. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons. Since then, however, open-market prices for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil have slipped to levels between $ 15 and $ 18 a barrel, despite stronger-than-usual efforts by the key producers to abide by their production quotas. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a London-based oil consultant, said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil production in March probably was not much above its official ceiling for 12 members of 15.06 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the 13th member, is not included in the December agreement and is believed to be pumping about 2.5 million barrels daily. Thus total <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output is thought to be about 17.6 million barrels daily. `` It beats me what they can do'' now to drive prices back up to $ 18 a barrel, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview. The five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers, representing <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, are expected to assess oil market conditions and recommend action for the next full meeting of the cartel, which is set for June 8 here. <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> told reporters he saw little chance that a special conference of all 13 members would be called before June. <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the Nigerian oil minister and chairman of the weekend meeting, said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was not satisfied with the current level of oil prices. `` We wanted a price of $ 18; we have n't got it,'' he told reporters Thursday. He declined to discuss possible actions to raise the price. The five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers, constituting the cartel's recently created price-monitoring committee, also are to review a Dutch auditing firm's report on January and February production levels by individual <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. One of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest problems in seeking to influence oil prices through production controls is a lack of timely and reliable information about the production of its own members. Some, including <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war rivals <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, consider such data to be state secrets. Some analysts said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> had to cut its production further in order to reverse the decline in prices. `` The market is signaling that this is what is needed, but I do n't see it happening,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mackenzie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said there was not much Saturday's meeting could do, given the continuing worldwide oversupply of oil and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to agree on new output cuts `` I suspect it's going to be brave words but not anything more than that,'' he said. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said he believed oil prices in the open market were likely to decline by as much as $ 1.50 a barrel over the next two month before stabilizing. Although this weekend's talks may not influence the short-term direction of prices, they may provide clues about shifts in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term strategy A key question for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> now is whether to resort to its traditional tactic of cutting production in an effort to bolster prices. Some analysts think a consensus among key <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members may be emerging that the cartel should draw a line on sacrificing production, since non-OPEC producers such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are only taking up the production slack that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has created. As a result <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has been losing on both volume and price.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, moving to earn more money on its intellectual property, said Friday it will raise the ceiling on its patent license fees to 5 percent from the current 1 percent. The decision is likely to put pressure on the profit margins of companies that require licenses to make products compatible with those of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest computer company. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> holds 9,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patents and more than 23,000 counterpart patents around the world. The decision does not affect existing license agreements. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement came just weeks before the expected announcement of computers compatible with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old Personal System-2 personal computer. `` They certainly intend to cash in on their development effort'' on the Personal System-2, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also said it was reaffirming its long-standing practice of making its patents generally available for licensing to others under reasonable terms and conditions Some companies refuse to license some of their patents or license them selectively, to particular companies, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihalec </PERSON> noted. He said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> makes its patents generally available `` because it's good for the industry.'' Under the new rates, licensees will pay a maximum of 1 percent of sales revenue on a product using a single <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> patent. They will pay up to 5 percent of sales revenue on products using multiple patents, depending on the number of patents used and the extent of their use. Under the old rates, which were last changed 10 years ago, the maximum royalty was 1 percent regardless of the number of patents used. License fees of 3 to 5 percent are fairly common in industry, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnevale </PERSON>, director of the microcomputer service of InfoCorp, a consulting and research company based in <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I would say that's in the ballpark,'' agreed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernacchi </PERSON>, an intellectual-property attorney in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He said patents have become more valuable since the federal court system has become more consistent in enforcing them. Many companies have cross-licensing agreements with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> that allow the companies to use each other's patents without fees for specified periods. In other cases, the agreements provide for free use of certain patents and require payment for use of others. `` Any licensee can look at the license they have from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and figure out what they're covered for,'' <PERSON> Mihalec </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies rumored to be preparing to announce a Personal System-2 computer, has a long-standing cross-licensing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Juge </PERSON>, director of market planning. <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes big mainframe computers that run the same software as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframes, also has a cross-licensing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which expires at the end of 1991, spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` It will have no current effect on us,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> noted that a patent license is not a license to copy products that use the covered patent. It is not a transfer of the technology or trade secrets that went into developing a product and it does not allow a licensee to infringe other forms of intellectual property rights such as copyrights. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has said it has applied for both patents and copyrights on Micro Channel Architecture, the internal data pathway that is a critical part of its new Personal System-2.

<HEAD>Discount Real Estate Broker Closing Doors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A real estate company that tried to be a maverick by selling homes for fees well below the prevailing rate is going out of business eight months after opening. <ORGANIZATION> Barclay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> is being forced to close its doors mainly because it could not attract top agents, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinzly </PERSON>, the company's president, said Thursday. The real estate agency was offering to sell houses for a 3 -LCB- percent commission, sharply below the going rate of 6 percent. Buyers were also being offered a 1 percent bonus for purchasing a home listed by <ORGANIZATION> Barclay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON>. Agents for the company were offered a salary instead of the standard commission _ a factor that others in the real estate business had predicted would hinder <ORGANIZATION> Barclay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON>' recruitment efforts. <PERSON> Kinzly </PERSON> said she believed agents were reluctant to join the company because of fear of something new and concern about how they would be viewed by others in the business. If <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> represented both the buyer and the seller, the agency would net only a 2 -LCB- percent commission. Other brokerages were offered a 2 percent shared commission, so <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>'s net commission could be as little as half a percent. Although real estate commissions are negotiable, most are 6 percent, shared equally between the listing and selling brokers. The company had sold four or five houses, and had deposits on another six, <PERSON> Kinzly </PERSON> said, adding that many of the sales had been on a shared-commission basis. A few dozen homeowners had listed their houses with the agency, and `` things were picking up a lot,'' said <PERSON> Kinzly </PERSON>. She said she disagreed with Chairman <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' decision to quit now. <PERSON> Kinzly </PERSON> said she would have liked to see the company remain in business at least through the spring house-selling season. `` That could have made it go,'' she said. The company had been at the center of a controversy in the real estate community after it sued four area brokers in February, charging unfair trade practices and conspiracy to restrain trade. The other brokers had offered <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> a lower shared commission than that offered to other agencies. Last month, a judge granted a motion by two of the defendants to have the case referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> for arbitration. One of the other companies reached a settlement with <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Advance Sharply</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cattle futures advanced sharply Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting expectations of improved beef demand. On other markets, grain and soybean futures moved higher, energy futures declined and precious metals were slightly higher. Livestock traders got clipped earlier in the week with limit declines in some cattle deliveries. `` Now we've gone a long way to return a little optimism to the market,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. There seemed to be a general belief that cash cattle prices will improve next week along with wholesale beef, he said. `` The expectations are for improved demand throughout the beef trade,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. `` There should be a return of retail interest in beef and the packers will have to buy live animals because they've done little of it in recent days.'' Hog and pork belly futures also did well, in part because of spillover support from the cattle pit, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. `` Also, a lot of traders are expecting a seasonal bottom in hog prices,'' he said. Live cattle settled .05 cent to 1.47 cents higher with the contract for delivery in April at 74.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .58 cent higher with April at 80.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent lower to .70 cent higher with April at 45.37 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to 1.15 cents higher with May at 54.47 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans set contracts high early in the session, then in a wild finish slumped to the day's lows before reaching new highs again. Large speculative buying, led by <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, accounted for much of the activity, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was a day of wild gyrations,'' he said. `` There were some big sellers, too, but I think this market does not want to go down.'' The market is expecting a government report coming out Monday to show a further drawdown in soybean stocks, said <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>. `` This would give a very low stocks-to-usage ratio,'' he said. `` So if any problems develop with the weather later this spring or summer, this market could explode to the upside.'' Wheat and corn futures also were higher, partly in response to the performance in the bean pit. Wheat also got help from export activity. Wheat settled 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with the May contract at $ 3.16 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with May at $ 2.09 a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.66 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents higher with May at $ 6.78 a bushel. Energy futures took a dip, heading into the weekend meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing committee. `` Up to this morning there was some speculation that there might be a surprise'' coming out of the meeting that would send prices higher, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, senior oil analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. A change of feeling came on remarks by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, who indicated the pricing committee would meet only one day, said <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>. The implication is that the session would be a perfunctory one, with no recommendation for a special <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting or for production cuts. `` Those anticipations were put to rest today by <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>'s remarks,'' said <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 20 cents lower with the May contract at $ 16.88 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .57 cent lower with May at 45.46 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .45 cent lower with May at 48.77 cents a gallon. Stock index futures at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> advanced with the June contract for the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settling at 269.90, up 2.30 points. The underlying spot index was up 3.27 at 269.43. Precious metals futures advanced slightly on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold was 70 cents to $ 1 higher with the June contract at $ 453.70 a troy ounce; and silver was .3 cent to .4 cent higher with May at $ 6.438 a troy ounce.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday it has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Rediffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Similation </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest suppliers of flight simulators, for $ 283 million. Rediffusion, which is based in <LOCATION> Crawley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and has operations in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is owned by <ORGANIZATION> BET </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a conglomerate headquartered in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

Acquisition of Rediffusion will expand <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' existing operations in the pilot-training field. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> currently builds a weapons tactics trainer for the F-A18 jet and the mission trainer for the F-14A jet. Rediffusion, with a work force of 2,500 and annual sales of about $ 260 million, will be operated as a subsidiary of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` Hughes expects that simulators will be used increasingly by military customers to train pilots and operators as defense budgets flatten out,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelon </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, adding that the acquisition will `` make <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> a a major factor in this field.'' The current world market for military and civilian simulators is $ 3 billion a year and that is expected to grow to $ 4 billion a year by 1993. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said it expects the use of simulators will be expanded into non-aircraft areas, such as factory automation and machine repair.

<HEAD>Boeing's New 747 Delayed By Electrical Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first flight of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s new 747-400 jumbo jet has been delayed by electrical problems, the company said. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the first deliveries of the plane, which was formally introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in January, are still expected in December but are n't a certainty. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> both said they are scheduled to receive two of the planes in December. Analysts said that if the four planes planned for December delivery are delayed into January, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 sales could be reduced by about $ 500 million and pre-tax operating profits could be cut by as much as $ 100 million. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he estimates <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would receive close to $ 25 million in operating profit on each 747-400. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, estimated each plane could generate $ 35 million in profit. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said it is possible the airplane's problems could delay certification of the jetliner by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The first flight had been scheduled for March 21, but <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said he now expects it to be `` the latter part of this month.'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said the electrical problems involve the main power generation system. He said the new 747, the world's largest commercial jetliner, has proven to be more complex to build than originally expected. The sophisticated electronics of the plane include a computerized cockpit that allows for a crew of two, rather than the three required on the earlier 747s. Also, the four-engine plane has improved aerodynamics with a bigger wingspan and added vertical winglets at their tips. It is powered by new engines. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said the job also has been complicated by `` customer pressure to change things, to tailor-make it to suit their requirements.'' The 747-400 is designed to carry as many as 479 passengers and has a range of 8,000 miles. Northwest, the initial customer for the plane, has ordered 10 of the jets with spare parts, worth $ 1.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 14 and taken options for six others, for a total value of $ 3.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received $ 13 billion to $ 14 billion in firm orders for 118 of the jets, plus options for 66 others. Each plane sells for about $ 125 million. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had profit of $ 480 million, or $ 3.10 a share, on sales of $ 15.35 billion in 1987. The company expects sales of $ 17 billion this year.

<HEAD>Textile Manufacturers Urge Legislation To Protect Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cheaply-manufactured textiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other nations fueled a 17 percent increase in the textile trade deficit in 1987 while taking away jobs from Americans, industry representatives said Thursday. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, meeting here through Saturday, said that unless federal legislation is passed setting a 1 percent annual ceiling on import growth, textile production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could cease by the mid-1990s. Imported clothing now accounts for 54 percent of all garments sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to institute figures. About 2.2 million people make their living in the nation's textile industry, according to institute figures This represents a loss of about 350,000 jobs since 1980, including 10,000 jobs lost in March alone, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidlaw </PERSON>, president of the group. He blamed the situation in part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration's failure to enforce import quotas. <ORGANIZATION> Laidlaw </ORGANIZATION> urged passage of the Textile and Apparel Trade Act, which faces a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next month. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imposed an embargo against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> exported 12 million yards of fabric to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> instead of the 4 million yards provided under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quotas, he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Laidlaw </ORGANIZATION> added the embargo was lifted when Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. He said a 1988 limit was set at 23.5 million yards. `` The government is happily giving away our industry, and people are not going to re-invest if they do n't have confidence,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Laidlaw </ORGANIZATION>. The primary competition comes from government-subsidized manufacturers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and other nations producing textiles for as little as 20 cents an hour in wages. `` On an even field, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry can compete with anyone,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, institute spokesman. `` But it ca n't compete when governments subsidize exports made by low-wage earners in deplorable conditions that would be illegal in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> It's crazy. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> figures show imports of textiles and apparel in 1987 reached a record $ 29 billion, while exports totaled $ 4 billion. The industry's $ 24.8 billion trade deficit for textiles and apparel now equals 14.5 percent of the nation's overall trade deficit, according to <ORGANIZATION> Laidlaw </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we look at the growth of the nation's overall trade deficit from 1986 to 1987, one fourth of that diastrous growth has been at the expense of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textile and apparel industry and its 2 million employees,'' he said.

It did not disclose the identities of other investors. <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the offer. Rumors have been circulating for weeks that an offer was in the works, although it was expected to be about $ 30 per share or higher, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, a broker with <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ardshiel </PERSON> said it might be willing to raise the offer.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group led by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> communications investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F.X </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> said Friday it had agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns seven radio stations and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> said his group will pay about $ 40 million to the owners of the privately-held broadcasting concern and will assume about $ 260 million in debt. `` <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> is a premier radio group,'' <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> said. `` We believe our financial resources and strong broadcast operating expertise will provide Metropolitan with a solid foundation for renewed growth.'' The sale is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Metropolitan Broadcasting was created in November 1986 when a group that included the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and managers of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s radio division bought the division for $ 285 million in a leveraged buyout In a leveraged buyout, the buyers often borrow heavily against the assets or cash flow of the company being acquired to make the purchase. Metropolitan originally included nine radio stations and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> radio network, but sold two stations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> last fall. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlpine </PERSON>, a media industry analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the stations were sold to help meet the heavy interest costs associated with the debt incurred in the buyout. Metropolitan currently owns WNEW-AM and WNEW-FM in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, WMMR-FM in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, KTWV-FM in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, WWBA-FM in the Tampa-St. <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> area in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, WOMC-FM in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, KRLD-AM in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which provides programming to radio stations in that state <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> said his company would cancel <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION>'s announced plan to sell WNEW-AM and would review <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed sale of WWBA-FM. But he said the previously-announced sale of WOMC-FM in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> would go forward, pending <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> approval. <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Sillerman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed for the purpose of buying the radio properties. <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> is chairman and chief executive of that company, as well as of <ORGANIZATION> Sillerman-Magee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based communications investment concern. In addition, <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> and his associates are the largest shareholders in <ORGANIZATION> Legacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates 10 radio stations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> said the Metropolitan stations had been profitable and were not for sale when he began conversations about the acquisition only nine days ago He said the stations should be able to generate more profit and revenue through additional investment in more aggressive promotion. He said his group's purchase should also end speculation about whether more of the group's stations would be sold. He said Metropolitan's corporate and station management would remain `` substantially intact.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We look forward to building on strong expected results and to an era of expansion and enhanced profitability for <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Eastern Files Brief in Appeal of Court Ruling on Shuttle Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Friday filed an opening brief in its appeal of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that blocked the sale of the profitable <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> to a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The appeal will be heard May 5. In its brief, the airline said the court ruling was wrong because the air shuttle sale was a managerial move that did n't violate collective bargaining agreements Eastern said the court's decision denied the company $ 225 million the sale would have brought and permitted the court to assume potentially unlimited oversight authority over the airline's affairs, threatening its ability to manage its finances The company also said the ruling gave the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union reason to delay negotiating a contract. Eastern said the shuttle sale involved no involuntary employee transfers and would not cause any <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers to lose employment rights. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declared March 10 that Eastern was in contempt of court for trying to sell the shuttle. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, broke federal labor law when it arranged to sell the shuttle. He also said the sale violated an order he issued last July barring Eastern from transferring 6,000 ground workers into a new subsidiary called Airport Ground Services.

<HEAD>Disney Scraps Plan for $300 Million Burbank Entertainment Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an unexpected move, the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> scrapped plans Friday for $ 300 million entertainment complex in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, and city officials indicated they were looking at other alternatives including a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a two-page letter to the head of <ORGANIZATION> Burbank </ORGANIZATION>'s redevelopment agency, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovrom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said the project was n't justifiable economically. Based on projected costs and attendance at the planned complex, `` the projected return on <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s investment simply did not meet corporate thresholds for an investment of this magnitude and anticipated business risk,'' the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> declined to elaborate on what that profit threshold is. Last May, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> entered into an agreement with <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> to negotiate exclusively to develop 40 acresof city-owned land alongside the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Since then, <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said, the company has invested 22,000 man-hours and spent $ 2.5 million on planning studies, market research and related economic analyses. The complex was envisioned as including movie backlot tours, theaters, shopping areas, a hotel, a planetarium, rides and nightclubs _ a different format that the company's <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> theme park in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, about 30 miles away in neighboring <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The complex was to be about two miles from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s crowded studio and headquarters in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>. The exclusivity of the negotiating agreement was attacked by rival entertainment conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> and operator of a successful studio backlot tour in nearby Universal City. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> claimed it had been unfairly barred from making a competing proposal to develop the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> site and has filed suit to block the Disney-Burbank agreement. <PERSON> Ovrom </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>'s redevelopment chief, said in a three-page memorandum to the mayor and city council that he felt `` a tremendous amount of disappointment'' over <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. But he added, `` We are all big boys and big girls, and we know going into this agreement that it was just a feasibility study ... We, too, shall immediately shift gears.'' <PERSON> Ovrom </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, in its lawsuit, had indicated it was interested in making a proposal for developing the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> site. `` I am sure we all anxiously await to see what they will submit now that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> is no longer in the picture,'' <PERSON> Ovrom </PERSON> said in the memorandum. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said the company had no comment on its plans. <PERSON> Ovrom </PERSON> said he had no regrets about granting Disney the exclusive agreement. `` The concept that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive -RRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> originally envisioned was very exciting and could have been very special for <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ovrom </PERSON> said in the memo. `` Had we turned down <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to study these possibilities, we would have gone to our graves always wondering what might have been.''
